ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Executive Summary Financial Highlights and Trends In 2010, we generated net sales of $7.806 billion, as compared to $8.188 billion in 2009, a decrease of $382 million, or five percent. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed $62 million to our net sales in 2010, as compared to 2009. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, our net sales decreased $444 million, or five percent, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was attributable in part to the ship hold and removal of field inventory of all implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT D) systems offered by our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) division in the U.S., which we announced on March 15, 2010, after determining that certain instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We have since submitted the required documentation and, on April 15, 2010, we received clearance from the FDA for certain of the manufacturing changes and immediately resumed distribution of our COGNIS CRT D systems and TELIGEN ICD systems, which represent virtually all of our defibrillator implant volume in the U.S. We returned earlier generations of these products to the U.S. market on May 21, 2010, following required FDA clearance. We are working with our physician and patient customers to recapture market share lost as a result of the ship hold and have experienced better than expected recovery to date. However, our U.S. CRM net sales decreased $237 million in 2010, as compared to our market share exiting 2009, and we estimate that our U.S. defibrillator market share decreased approximately 300 basis points exiting 2010, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to these product actions. In addition, throughout 2010 we continued to experience competitive and other pricing pressures across our businesses and, particularly, on our drug eluting coronary stent system offerings. Net sales of our drug eluting coronary stent systems decreased $171 million in 2010, as compared to 2009, and we estimate that the average selling price of our drug eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased nine percent in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Further, our net sales have been adversely impacted by reductions in procedural volumes, due to unemployment levels and other economic factors. During 2010, net sales from our Endoscopy, Urology/Womens Health, and Neuromodulation businesses increased $117 million, or eight percent, as compared to 2009, on the strength of new product introductions, increased sales investments and further expansion into international markets. Refer to the Business and Market Overview and Results of Operations sections for more discussion of our net sales by division and region. Our reported net loss in 2010 was $1.065 billion, or $0.70 per share, and was driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charge related to our U.S. CRM reporting unit following the ship hold and product removal actions described above. Our reported results for 2010 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition , divestiture , litigation and restructuring related net charges; discrete tax items and amortization expense (after tax) of $2.116 billion, or $1.39 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2010 was $1.051 billion, or $0.69 per share. Our reported net loss in 2009 was $1.025 billion, or $0.68 per share. Our reported results for 2009 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition , divestiture , litigation and restructuring related net charges; discrete tax items and amortization expense of $2.207 billion (after tax), or $1.46 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2009 was $1.182 billion, or $0.78 per share. Net income and net income per share that exclude certain items are not measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). See Additional Information for an explanation of managements use of these non GAAP measures. The following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to those adjusted results considered by management.

Cash generated by operating activities was $325 million in 2010 and $835 million in 2009, and included approximately $1.6 billion of litigation related net payments in 2010, as compared to approximately $800 million in 2009, as well as the receipt of an acquisition related milestone payment of $250 million. Our cash generated by operations continues to be a significant source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth. As of December 31, 2010, we had total debt of $5.438 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $213 million and working capital of $1.006 billion. During 2010, we completed the refinancing of the majority of our 2011 debt maturities, establishing a $1.0 billion term loan and syndicating a new $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, and prepaid in full our $900 million loan from Abbott and all $600 million of our senior notes due in June 2011. Further, in January 2011, we paid at maturity $250 million of our senior notes. In 2009, Standard Poors upgraded our credit rating to investment grade with a stable outlook. In 2010, Fitch Ratings upgraded our outlook to positive from stable, and Moodys raised our liquidity rating to its highest level. We believe these rating improvements reflect the strength of our product portfolio, our commitment to debt reduction, our improving financial fundamentals, and the progress we are making towards driving profitable sales growth. Recent Events As part of our strategy, we are realigning our business portfolio through select divestitures and targeted acquisitions in order to reduce risk, optimize operational leverage and accelerate profitable, sustainable revenue growth, while preserving our ability to meet the needs of physicians and their patients. We have recently announced several acquisitions targeting many of our priority growth areas, and, in January 2011, closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. 39 Table of Contents Acquisitions We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises, and are also investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, priority growth areas including atrial fibrillation, autonomic modulation therapy, coronary artery disease, deep brain stimulation, diabetes/obesity, endoluminal surgery, endoscopic pulmonary intervention, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, structural heart disease, sudden cardiac arrest, and womens health. In late 2010 and early 2011, we announced the acquisitions of Asthmatx, Inc.; Sadra Medical, Inc.; Atritech, Inc.; and Intelect Medical, Inc., targeting many of the above conditions and disease states. Each of these acquisitions is discussed in the Business and Market Overview section below. Business Divestiture In January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion at closing, including an upfront payment of $1.426 billion, and $24 million which was placed into escrow to be released upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions, and will receive an additional $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will be completed over a period of approximately 24 months. We will provide transitional services through a transition services agreement, and will also supply products to Stryker. These transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective for a period of up to 24 months following the closing of the transaction, subject to extension. Due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. Refer to Note C Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Business and Market Overview Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) Our CRM division develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. Worldwide net sales of these products of $2.180 billion represented approximately 28 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2010. Our worldwide CRM net sales decreased $233 million, or ten percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our CRM net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by the negative impact of the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our ICD and CRT D systems earlier in the year. We experienced market share loss in the U.S. as a result of these actions; however, we believe that our products, including our COGNIS CRT D and TELIGEN ICD systems, among the worlds smallest and thinnest high energy devices, will continue to be successful in the global market. While we have recaptured a portion of our lost market share, the extent and timing of our recovery is difficult to predict. We estimate that our U.S. defibrillator market share exiting 2010 decreased approximately 300 basis points, as compared to our market share exiting 2009, due primarily to these product actions. Further, overall expectations of future CRM market growth have declined, driven primarily by competitive and other pricing pressures, as well as fewer launches of market expanding technologies than previously anticipated. We estimate that the worldwide CRM market approximated $11.4 billion in 2010, representing a slight increase over the 2009 market size of $11.1 billion. In addition, physician reaction to study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association regarding evidence based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S. Department of Justice investigation into ICD implants may have a negative impact on the CRM market. However, in September 2010, we received FDA approval for an exclusive expanded indication for use of our CRT D systems with certain patients in earlier stages of heart failure. We believe this indication could potentially create an opportunity to expand the worldwide CRM market by approximately $250 million to $350 million over the next few years, and further enhance our position within that market. 40 Table of Contents The following are the components of our worldwide CRM net sales: Year Ended Year Ended (in millions) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 U.S. International Total U.S. International Total Defibrillator systems $ 1,037 $ 562 $ 1,599 $ 1,248 $ 544 $ 1,792 Pacemaker systems 320 261 581 346 275 621 CRM products $ 1,357 $ 823 $ 2,180 $ 1,594 $ 819 $ 2,413 Our U.S. CRM net sales decreased $237 million, or 15 percent, in 2010 as compared to 2009, driven primarily by the ship hold and product removal actions involving our ICD and CRT D systems, discussed above. We are committed to advancing our technologies to strengthen our CRM business. In 2010, we continued to execute on our product pipeline and expect to launch our next generation line of defibrillators in the U.S. in late 2011 or early 2012, which include new features designed to improve functionality, diagnostic capability and ease of use. Due in part to anticipated changes to current FDA regulatory requirements industry wide, which would increase the number of patients and length of time needed for certain clinical studies, we now expect to launch our next generation INGENIO pacemaker system, which leverages the strength of our high voltage platform and will be compatible with our LATITUDE Patient Management System, in the U.S. in late 2011 or early 2012, depending on final FDA requirements. Refer to Regulatory Environment included in Item 1 of this Annual Report for more information. Our international CRM net sales increased $4 million, or less than one percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. International net sales of our defibrillator systems increased $18 million, or three percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009, driven by strong market acceptance of our COGNIS CRT D and TELIGEN ICD systems, and our recently launched 4 SITE lead delivery system. In addition, in July 2009, we received CE Mark approval for our LATITUDE Patient Management System and have since launched this technology in the majority of our European markets. The LATITUDE technology, which is designed to enable physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients are in their homes, is a key component of many of our CRM systems. In late 2010, we received CE Mark approval for our next generation line of defibrillators, INCEPTA, ENERGEN and PUNCTUA, and plan to launch these products in our Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) region and certain Inter Continental countries in the first half of 2011. These products provide physicians and their patients with more options to customize therapy and enhance our market advantage in size, shape and longevity. We also plan to launch our next generation INGENIO pacemaker system in these regions in the second half of 2011 and believe that these launches position us well within the worldwide CRM market. Net sales from our CRM products represent a significant source of our overall net sales. Therefore, increases or decreases in our CRM net sales could have a significant impact on our results of operations. The variables that may impact the size of the CRM market and or our share of that market include, but are not limited to: our ability to retain and attract key members of our CRM sales force and other key CRM personnel; our ability to recapture lost market share following the ship hold and product removal of our ICD and CRT D systems in the U.S.; the impact of market and economic conditions on average selling prices and the overall number of procedures performed; the ability of CRM manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community, the referring physician community and prospective patients in CRM technologies; future product field actions or new physician advisories by us or our competitors; our ability to successfully develop and launch next generation products and technology; 41 Table of Contents clinical trials that may provide opportunities to expand indications for use, particularly in light of anticipated changes to current FDA regulatory requirements industry wide; variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products; delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; and new competitive launches. Coronary Stent Systems Our coronary stent system offerings include the VeriFLEX (Libert) bare metal coronary stent system, designed to enhance deliverability and conformability, particularly in challenging lesions, as well as drug eluting coronary stent systems. We are the only company in the industry to offer a two drug platform strategy, which has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the drug eluting stent market. We currently market our TAXUS paclitaxel eluting stent line, including our third generation TAXUS Element stent system, launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter Continental countries during the second quarter of 2010. The CE Mark approval for our TAXUS Element stent system includes a specific indication for treatment in diabetic patients. We also offer our everolimus eluting stent line, consisting of the PROMUS stent system, currently supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories, and our next generation internally developed and manufactured everolimus eluting stent system, the PROMUS Element stent system, which we launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter Continental countries in the fourth quarter of 2009. In September 2010, we received CE Mark approval for expanded indications for the use of our PROMUS Element stent system in diabetic and heart attack patients. Our Element stent platform incorporates a unique platinum chromium alloy designed to offer greater radial strength and flexibility than older alloys, enhanced visibility and reduced recoil. The innovative stent design improves deliverability and allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution. These product offerings demonstrate our commitment to drug eluting stent market leadership and continued innovation. We expect to launch our TAXUS Element stent system in the U.S. (to be commercialized as ION) in mid 2011 and Japan in late 2011 or early 2012. We expect to launch our PROMUS Element stent system in the U.S. and Japan in mid 2012. Net sales of our coronary stent systems, including bare metal stent systems, of $1.670 billion represented approximately 21 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2010. Worldwide sales of these products decreased $209 million, or 11 percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $26 million to our coronary stent system net sales in 2010, as compared to 2009, net sales of these products decreased 12 percent, as compared to the prior year. Despite continued competition and pricing pressures resulting in a decline in sales of these products, we maintained our leadership position in 2010 with an estimated 36 percent share of the worldwide drug eluting stent market, as compared to 41 percent in 2009. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated $5.0 billion in 2010, consistent with the 2009 market size. The size of the coronary stent market is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed, as well as the percentage of those in which stents are implanted; the number of devices used per procedure; average selling prices; and the drug eluting stent penetration rate2. 2 A measure of the mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents used across procedures. 42 Table of Contents The following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales: Year Ended Year Ended (in millions) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 U.S. International Total U.S. International Total TAXUS $ 277 $ 223 $ 500 $ 431 $ 596 $ 1,027 PROMUS 528 282 810 480 201 681 PROMUS Element 227 227 Drug eluting stent systems 805 732 1,537 911 797 1,708 Bare metal stent systems 44 89 133 57 114 171 $ 849 $ 821 $ 1,670 $ 968 $ 911 $ 1,879 Our U.S. net sales of drug eluting stent systems decreased $106 million, or 12 percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. This decrease resulted primarily from a decline in our share of the U.S. drug eluting stent market, as well as an overall decrease in the size of this market, resulting principally from lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures. We estimate our share of the U.S. drug eluting stent market approximated 46 percent for the last five quarters, as compared to an average of 49 percent during 2009, and estimate that the average selling price of drug eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased approximately nine percent in 2010, as compared to 2009. This decline was due primarily to lower sales of our TAXUS drug eluting stent systems, which we believe was due to customer perceptions of data from a single center, non double blinded, underpowered study sponsored by one of our competitors. We believe that average drug eluting stent penetration rates in the U.S. were 77 percent in 2010, as compared to an average of 75 percent during 2009, which partially offset the impact of lower average selling prices on the size of the U.S. drug eluting stent market. We believe we have maintained our leadership position in this market due to the success of our two drug platform strategy and the breadth of our product offerings, including the industrys widest range of coronary stent sizes. Our international drug eluting stent system net sales decreased $65 million, or eight percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. Net sales of our drug eluting stent systems in Japan decreased $49 million, or 19 percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year and our estimated share of the drug eluting stent market in Japan declined to an average of 39 percent in 2010 (exiting at 36 percent), as compared to an average of 49 percent in 2009 (exiting at 44 percent). We believe that aggressive pricing offered by market entrants and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain customers contributed to the decline in our market share in Japan in 2010, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by our first quarter 2010 launch of the PROMUS stent system in Japan, enabling us to begin the execution of our two drug platform strategy in this region. Our net sales of drug eluting stent systems in our EMEA region decreased $26 million, or eight percent in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to declines in average selling prices, partially offset by increased penetration rates. However, in the second quarter of 2010, we launched our third generation TAXUS Element stent system in our EMEA region and certain Inter Continental countries. We believe that this launch, coupled with the November 2009 launch of our PROMUS Element stent system, which has quickly gained market share, exiting 2010 with approximately one quarter share of the drug eluting stent market in EMEA, position us well in this market going forward. Net sales of drug eluting stent systems in our Inter Continental region increased $10 million, or five percent, driven by an increase in penetration rates and procedural volume. We market the PROMUS everolimus eluting coronary stent system, a private labeled XIENCE V stent system supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories. As of the closing of Abbotts 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corporations vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, we obtained a perpetual license to the intellectual property used in Guidants drug eluting stent system program purchased by Abbott. We believe that being the only company to offer two distinct drug eluting stent platforms provides us a considerable advantage in the drug eluting stent market and has enabled us to sustain our worldwide leadership position. However, under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit and operating profit margin of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott, including any improvements or iterations approved for sale during the term of the applicable supply arrangements and of the type that could be approved by a supplement to an approved FDA pre market approval, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS and PROMUS Element stent systems. Specifically, the PROMUS stent system has operating profit margins that approximate half of our TAXUS stent system operating profit margin. Therefore, if sales of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to 43 Table of Contents us by Abbott increase in relation to our total drug eluting stent system sales, our profit margins will decrease. Refer to our Gross Profit discussion for more information on the impact this sales mix has had on our gross profit margins. Our internally developed and manufactured PROMUS Element everolimus eluting stent system, launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter Continental countries in the fourth quarter of 2009, generates gross profit margins more favorable than the PROMUS stent system and we expect will positively affect our overall gross profit and operating profit margins in these regions as sales shift from PROMUS to PROMUS Element. Further, the price we pay for our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems from Abbott is determined by contracts with Abbott and is based, in part, on previously fixed estimates of Abbotts manufacturing costs for everolimus eluting stent systems and third party reports of our average selling price of these stent systems. Amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are subject to a retroactive adjustment approximately every two years based on Abbotts actual costs to manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott. Our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted in the future as a result of this adjustment process. We are currently reliant on Abbott for our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems in the U.S. and Japan. Our supply agreement with Abbott for everolimus eluting stent systems in the U.S. and Japan extends through the end of the second quarter of 2012. At present, we believe that our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems from Abbott, coupled with our current launch plans for our internally developed and manufactured PROMUS Element everolimus eluting stent system, is sufficient to meet customer demand. However, any production or capacity issues that affect Abbotts manufacturing capabilities or our process for forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may impact the ability to increase or decrease our level of supply in a timely manner; therefore, our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott may not align with customer demand, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Further, a delay in the launch of our internally developed and manufactured PROMUS Element everolimus eluting stent system in the U.S. and Japan, currently expected in mid 2012, could result in an inability to meet customer demand for everolimus eluting stent systems. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or third parties, or the markets perception of these clinical data, may adversely impact our position in, and share of, the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market. We believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market in the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons, including: our two drug platform strategy, including specialty stent sizes; the broad and consistent long term results of our TAXUS clinical trials, and the favorable results of the XIENCE V/PROMUS and PROMUS Element stent system clinical trials to date; the performance benefits of our current and future technology; the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products, including our PROMUS Element and TAXUS Element stent systems, in additional geographies; our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force; and the strength of our clinical, selling, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. 44 Table of Contents However, a decline in net sales from our drug eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting stent market and our position within this market include, but are not limited to: the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems available in the market; the impact and outcomes of on going and future clinical results involving our or our competitors products, including those trials sponsored by our competitors, or perceived product performance of our or our competitors products; physician and patient confidence in our current and next generation technology; our ability to successfully launch next generation products and technology features, including the PROMUS Element and TAXUS Element stent systems in additional geographies; changes in drug eluting stent penetration rates, the overall number of PCI procedures performed and the average number of stents used per procedure; delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; new competitive product launches; and the outcome of intellectual property litigation. During 2009 and early 2010, we successfully negotiated closure of several long standing legal matters, including multiple matters with Johnson Johnson; all outstanding litigation between us and Medtronic, Inc. with respect to interventional cardiology and endovascular repair cases; and all outstanding litigation between us and Bruce Saffran, M.D., Ph.D. However, there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market. In particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson Johnson, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, particularly relating to drug eluting stent systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) In addition to coronary stent systems, our Interventional Cardiology business markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, as well as ultrasound imaging systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products decreased to $932 million in 2010, as compared to $980 million in 2009, a decrease of $48 million, or five percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations which contributed $12 million to our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year, net sales of these products decreased $60 million, or six percent. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $394 million in 2010, as compared to $409 million in 2009. Our international net sales of these products were $538 million in 2010, as compared to $571 million for the prior year. This decrease was the result of a delay in new product introductions, pricing pressures and competitive product launches. We continue to hold a strong leadership position in the PTCA balloon catheter market, maintaining an estimated 56 percent average share of the U.S. market and 38 percent worldwide in 2010. We have executed and are planning a number of additional new product launches during 2011, including the full launch of our Apex pre dilatation balloon catheter with platinum marker bands for improved radiopacity, launched in limited markets during the second quarter of 2010. In June 2010, we launched the NC Quantum Apex post dilatation balloon catheter, developed specifically to address physicians needs in optimizing coronary stent deployment, which has been received positively in the market. In addition, we began a phased launch of our Kinetix family of guidewires in the U.S., our EMEA region and certain Inter Continental countries in April 2010. 45 Table of Contents As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including structural heart. In January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. Sadra is developing a repositionable and retrievable device for percutaneous aortic valve replacement (PAVR) to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis and recently completed a series of European feasibility studies for its Lotus Valve System, which consists of a stent mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. The low profile delivery system and introducer sheath are designed to enable accurate positioning, repositioning and retrieval at any time prior to release of the aortic valve implant. PAVR is one of the fastest growing medical device markets. Peripheral Interventions Our Peripheral Interventions business product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, sheaths, wires and vena cava filters, which are used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease, and we continue to hold the number one position in the worldwide Peripheral Interventions market. Our worldwide net sales of these products increased to $669 million in 2010, as compared to $661 million in 2009, an increase of $8 million, or one percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $6 million to our Peripheral Interventions net sales in 2010, as compared the prior year, net sales of these products increased $2 million, or less than one percent, as compared to 2009. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $310 million in 2010, as compared to $320 million for the prior year. Our international net sales were $359 million in 2010, as compared to $341 million in 2009, driven by several international product launches, including the second quarter 2010 launch in Japan of our Carotid WALLSTENT Monorail Endoprosthesis. We look forward to new product launches, including our next generation percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon, expected in the second half of 2011 and believe that these launches, coupled with the strength of our Express SD Renal Monorail premounted stent system; our Express LD Stent System, which received FDA approval in the first quarter of 2010 for an iliac indication; our Sterling Monorail and Over the Wire balloon dilatation catheter and our extensive line of Interventional Oncology product solutions, will continue to position us well in the growing Peripheral Interventions market. Electrophysiology We develop less invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer line of ablation catheters, including our next generation Blazer Prime ablation catheter, designed to deliver enhanced performance, responsiveness and durability, which we launched in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2009. Worldwide net sales of our Electrophysiology products decreased to $147 million in 2010, as compared to $149 million in 2009, a decrease of $2 million, or two percent, due principally to product availability constraints with our Chilli II catheter line. Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our Electrophysiology net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $112 million, as compared to $116 million for the prior year, and our international net sales were $35 million in 2010, as compared to $33 million in 2009. We have begun a limited launch of our Blazer Prime ablation catheter in the U.S., our EMEA region and certain Inter Continental countries, and believe that with the increasing adoption of this technology and other upcoming product launches, we are well positioned within the Electrophysiology market. As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including atrial fibrillation. In January 2011, we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which we will acquire Atritech, Inc., subject to customary closing conditions. Atritech has developed a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology, developed by Atritech, is the first device proven in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to anticoagulant drugs, and is approved for use in CE Mark countries. Endoscopy Our Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products increased to $1.079 billion in 2010, as compared to $1.006 billion in 2009, an increase of $73 million, or seven percent. 46 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $9 million to our Endoscopy net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year, net sales of these products increased $64 million, or six percent, as compared to 2009. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $541 million in 2010, as compared to $517 million for the prior year, and our international net sales were $538 million in 2010, as compared to $489 million in 2009. These increases were due primarily to higher net sales within our stent franchise, driven by the continued commercialization and adoption of our WallFlex family of stents, in particular, the WallFlex Biliary line and WallFlex Esophageal line. In addition, our hemostasis franchise net sales benefited from increased utilization of our Resolution Clip Device, an endoscopic mechanical clip to treat gastrointestinal bleeding, and our biliary franchise drove solid growth on the strength of our rapid exchange biliary devices. During 2010, we introduced expanded sizes of our Radial Jaw 4 biopsy forceps, and have launched a number of new products targeting the biliary interventional market. As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including endoscopic pulmonary intervention. On October 26, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Asthmatx, Inc. Asthmatx designs, manufactures and markets a less invasive, catheter based bronchial thermoplasty procedure for the treatment of severe persistent asthma. The Alair Bronchial Thermoplasty System, developed by Asthmatx, has both CE Mark and FDA approval and is the first device based asthma treatment approved by the FDA. We expect this technology to strengthen our existing offering of pulmonary devices and contribute to the mid to long term growth and diversification of the Endoscopy business. Urology/Womens Health Our Urology/Womens Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders. Our worldwide net sales of these products increased to $481 million in 2010 from $456 million in 2009, an increase of $25 million, or five percent. Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our Urology/Womens Health net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $365 million in 2010, as compared to $353 million in 2009, and our international net sales were $116 million in 2010, as compared to $103 million for the prior year. These increases were driven by new product introductions and increased sales investments. In 2011, we plan to expand the launch of our recently approved Genesys Hydro ThermAblator (HTA) system, a next generation endometrial ablation system designed to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in premenopausal women with menorrhagia. The Genesys HTA System features a smaller and lighter console, simplified set up requirements, and an enhanced graphic user interface and is designed to improve operating performance. We believe this new product offering will enable us to increase our share of this market. Neuromodulation Within our Neuromodulation business, we market the Precision Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) system, used for the management of chronic pain. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products increased to $304 million in 2010, as compared to $285 million in 2009, an increase of $19 million, or seven percent. Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our Neuromodulation net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $288 million in 2010 as compared to $271 million for the prior year, and our international net sales of these products were $16 million in 2010, as compared to $14 million in 2009, driven by an increase in procedural volume and new product launches. In 2010, we received FDA approval and launched two lead splitters, as well as the Linear 3 4 and Linear 3 6 Percutaneous Leads for use with our SCS systems, offering a broader range of lead configurations and designed to provide physicians more treatment options for their chronic pain patients. These represent the broadest range of percutaneous lead configurations in the industry. We believe that we continue to have a technology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as Multiple Independent Current Control, which is intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely, and are involved in various studies designed to evaluate the use of spinal cord stimulation in the treatment of additional sources of pain. As a demonstration of our commitment to strengthening clinical evidence with spinal cord stimulation, we have initiated a trial to assess the therapeutic effectiveness and cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation compared to reoperation in patients with failed back surgery syndrome. We believe that this trial could result in consideration of spinal cord stimulation much earlier in the continuum of care. In addition, in late 2010 we initiated a European clinical trial for the treatment of Parkinsons disease using our Vercise deep brain stimulation system, and, in January 2011, we completed the 47 Table of Contents acquisition of Intelect Medical, Inc., a development stage company developing advanced visualization and programming for the Vercise system. We believe this acquisition leverages the core architecture of our Vercise platform and advances the field of deep brain stimulation. Neurovascular In January 2011, we closed the sale our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. We will provide transitional services through a transition services agreement, and will also supply products to Stryker. These transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective for a period of up to 24 months following the closing of the transaction, subject to extension, and we will recognize net sales on the sale of Neurovascular products in certain countries during this period. Our future sales of Neurovascular products to Stryker will be significantly lower than our 2010 Neurovascular net sales and will be at significantly reduced gross margins. The Neurovascular business markets a broad line of coated and uncoated detachable coils, micro delivery stents, micro guidewires, micro catheters, guiding catheters and embolics to neuro interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons to treat diseases of the neurovascular system. Our worldwide net sales of Neurovascular products decreased to $340 million in 2010, as compared to $348 million in 2009, a decrease of $8 million, or two percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $7 million to Neurovascular net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year, net sales of these products decreased $15 million, or four percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $120 million, as compared to $125 million for the prior year, and our international net sales were $220 million in 2010, as compared to $223 million in 2009. These decreases resulted primarily from new competitive launches and a delay in the launch of the next generation family of detachable coils, as well the impact of a field action initiated during the third quarter with respect to selective lots of the Matrix Detachable Coil. However, in October 2010, we received FDA approval for the next generation family of detachable coils, which includes an enhanced delivery system designed to reduce coil detachment times and began a phased launch of the product in 2010. In 2010, we also launched the Neuroform EZ stent system, the fourth generation intracranial aneurysm stent system designed for use in conjunction with endovascular coiling to treat wide necked aneurysms, in the U.S. and our EMEA region. FDA Matters In January 2006, we received a corporate warning letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three site specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. We identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the FDA and implemented those solutions throughout our organization. During 2008, the FDA reinspected a number of our facilities and, in October 2008, informed us that our quality system was in substantial compliance with its Quality System Regulations. In November 2009 and January 2010, the FDA reinspected two of our sites to follow up on observations from the 2008 FDA inspections. Both of these FDA inspections confirmed that all issues at the sites have been resolved and all restrictions related to the corporate warning letter were removed. On August 11, 2010, we were notified by the FDA that the corporate warning letter had been lifted. In August 2010, the FDA released numerous draft proposals on the 510(k) process aimed at increasing transparency and streamlining the process, while adding more scientific rigor to the review process. In January 2011, the FDA released the implementation plan for changes to the 510(k) Submission program, which includes additional training of FDA staff, the creation of various guidance documents intended to provide greater clarity to certain processes, as well as various internal changes to the FDAs procedures. We have a portfolio of products that includes numerous Class II medical devices. Several of the FDAs proposals could increase the regulatory burden on our industry, including those that could increase the cost, complexity and time to market for certain high risk Class II medical devices. Restructuring Initiatives We are a diversified worldwide medical device leader and hold number one or two positions in the majority of the markets in which we compete. Since our inception, we have generated significant revenue growth driven by product innovation, strategic acquisitions and robust investments in research and development. We generate 48 Table of Contents strong cash flow, which has enabled us to reduce our debt obligations and further invest in our growth. On an on going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, and better alignment of expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that are essential to our long term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long term success. These initiatives are described below, and additional information can be found in Results of Operations and Note I Restructuring related Activities to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 2010 Restructuring plan On February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the centralization of our research and development organization; the re alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre tax operating expenses of approximately $200 million to $250 million, once completed in 2012. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. We expect the execution of the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately 1,000 to 1,300 positions worldwide. Plant Network Optimization In January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, discussed below, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. We estimate that the program will result in annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the estimated $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our 2007 Restructuring plan, discussed below. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. 2007 Restructuring plan In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan). The plan was intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value. Key activities under the plan included the restructuring of several businesses, corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination, suspension or reduction of spending on certain research and development projects; and the transfer of certain production lines among facilities. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008. We have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases, primarily in customer facing positions. In addition, we expect reductions of annualized run rate manufacturing costs of approximately $35 million exiting 2010 as a result of transfers of certain production lines. Due to the longer term nature of these initiatives, we do not expect to achieve the full benefit of these reductions in manufacturing costs until 2012. We initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007. The transfer of certain production lines contemplated under the 2007 Restructuring plan was completed as of December 31, 2010; all other major 49 Table of Contents activities under the plan, with the exception of final production line transfers, were completed as of December 31, 2009. Healthcare Reform The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. Certain provisions of the legislation will not be effective for a number of years and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood, and it is unclear what the full impact will be from the legislation. The legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in 2013. U.S. net sales represented 56 percent of our worldwide net sales in 2010 and, therefore, this tax burden may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Other provisions of this legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Results of Operations Net Sales We manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of foreign exchange for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using current period currency exchange rates. The regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note P Segment Reporting to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2010, we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions: the United States; EMEA, consisting of Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Japan; and Inter Continental, consisting of our Asia Pacific and the Americas operating segments. The reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment. The following tables provide our worldwide net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis: 2010 versus 2009 2009 versus 2008 As Reported Constant As Reported Constant Year Ended December 31, Currency Currency Currency Currency (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Basis Basis Basis Basis United States $ 4,335 $ 4,675 $ 4,487 (7) % (7) % 4 % 4 % EMEA 1,759 1,837 1,960 (4) % (1) % (6) % 1 % Japan 968 988 861 (2) % (8) % 15 % 4 % Inter Continental 740 677 673 9 % 1 % 1 % 8 % International 3,467 3,502 3,494 (1) % (3) % 0 % 3 % Subtotal 7,802 8,177 7,981 (5) % (5) % 2 % 4 % Divested Businesses 4 11 69 N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide $ 7,806 $ 8,188 $ 8,050 (5) % (5) % 2 % 3 % The following table provides our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. 50 Table of Contents 2010 versus 2009 2009 versus 2008 As Reported Constant As Reported Constant Year Ended December 31, Currency Currency Currency Currency (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Basis Basis Basis Basis Cardiac Rhythm Management $ 2,180 $ 2,413 $ 2,286 (10) % (10) % 6 % 7 % Interventional Cardiology 2,602 2,859 2,879 (9) % (10) % (1) % 0 % Peripheral Interventions 669 661 684 1 % 0 % (3) % (2) % Cardiovascular Group 3,271 3,520 3,563 (7) % (8) % (1) % 0 % Electrophysiology 147 149 153 (2) % (2) % (2) % (1) % Neurovascular 340 348 360 (2) % (4) % (3) % (2) % Endoscopy 1,079 1,006 943 7 % 6 % 7 % 8 % Urology/Womens Health 481 456 431 5 % 5 % 6 % 6 % Neuromodulation 304 285 245 7 % 7 % 17 % 17 % Subtotal 7,802 8,177 7,981 (5) % (5) % 2 % 4 % Divested Businesses 4 11 69 N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide $ 7,806 $ 8,188 $ 8,050 (5) % (5) % 2 % 3 % The divisional constant currency growth rates in the tables above can be recalculated from the reconciliations provided below.

The decrease was driven primarily by lower U.S. CRM net sales of $237 million, due primarily to the ship hold and product removal actions impacting our ICD and CRT D systems discussed above, as well as a decline in U.S. coronary stent system net sales of $119 million, due primarily to a decline in our share of the U.S. drug eluting stent market as well as lower average selling prices. In addition, U.S. net sales of our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) business decreased $15 million in 2010, as compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by increases of U.S. net sales in 2010 from our Endoscopy business of $24 million, $12 million attributable to our Urology/Womens Health business, and $17 million of growth in our Neuromodulation 51 Table of Contents business, as compared to 2009. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our net sales. During 2009, our U.S. net sales increased $188 million, or four percent, as compared to 2008. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in U.S. CRM net sales of $125 million and an increase of $47 million in U.S. net sales of our coronary stent systems. In addition, U.S. net sales in 2009 from our Endoscopy business grew $40 million, our Urology/Womens Health net sales increased $18 million, and our Neuromodulation division increased U.S. net sales $37 million in 2009, as compared to 2008. These increases were partially offset by declines in U.S. net sales from our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) business of $52 million and a decrease of $16 million in Peripheral Interventions U.S. net sales in 2009, as compared to the prior year. International Net Sales During 2010, our international net sales decreased $35 million, or one percent, as compared to 2009. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed $62 million to our international net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales in our EMEA region decreased $21 million, or one percent, in 2010, as compared the prior year. Our net sales in Japan decreased $81 million, or eight percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to competitive launches of drug eluting stent system technology and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain drug eluting stent system customers, as well as reductions in average selling prices. Net sales in our Inter Continental region, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $5 million, or one percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our net sales. During 2009, our international net sales increased $8 million, or less than one percent, as compared to 2008. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed a negative $92 million to our international net sales, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales in our EMEA region increased $11 million, or one percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008. Our net sales in Japan increased $37 million, or four percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to an increase in coronary stent system sales following the launch of our second generation TAXUS Libert stent system in that region. Net sales in our Inter Continental region increased $52 million, or eight percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, in 2009, as compared to the prior year. Gross Profit Our gross profit was $5.207 billion in 2010, $5.612 billion in 2009, and $5.581 billion in 2008. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit decreased to 66.7 percent in 2010, as compared to 68.5 percent in 2009 and 69.3 percent in 2008. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Gross profit prior year 68.5 % 69.3 % Drug eluting stent system sales mix and pricing (1.7) % (1.4) % Impact of CRM ship hold (0.4) % Net impact of foreign currency 0.1 % 0.9 % All other 0.2 % (0.3) % Gross profit current year 66.7 % 68.5 % The primary factor contributing to the reduction in our gross profit margin during 2010 and 2009, as compared to the prior years, was, in each year, a further decrease in sales of our higher margin TAXUS drug eluting stent systems and an increasing shift towards the PROMUS stent system, as well as declines in the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems. Sales of the PROMUS stent system represented approximately 52 percent of our worldwide drug eluting stent system sales in 2010, 40 percent in 2009, and 19 percent in 2008. As a result of the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit margin of a PROMUS stent system, supplied to us by Abbott, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS stent system. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we launched our next generation internally developed and manufactured PROMUS Element everolimus eluting 52 Table of Contents stent system in our EMEA region and certain Inter Continental countries. This product generates gross profit margins more favorable than the PROMUS stent system, and has positively affected our overall gross profit and operating profit margins. We expect to launch our PROMUS Element stent system in the U.S. and Japan in mid 2012. In addition, the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems have decreased, including an estimated nine percent decline in the U.S., in 2010, as compared to 2009. Our gross profit margin in 2010 was also negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. CRM business previously discussed. We expect our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, will continue to be negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices across our businesses. In addition, our 2011 gross profit percentage will be negatively impacted as a result of our expected low margin sales of Neurovascular product to Stryker under the terms of our transitional supply agreements. Operating Expenses The following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % of Net % of Net % of Net (in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,580 33.1 2,635 32.2 2,589 32.2 Research and development expenses 939 12.0 1,035 12.6 1,006 12.5 Royalty expense 185 2.4 191 2.3 203 2.5 Selling, General and Administrative (SGA) Expenses In 2010, our SGA expenses decreased $55 million, or two percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was related primarily to savings from our restructuring initiatives driven by lower head count and lower consulting and travel spending, as compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an $11 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations. As a percentage of net sales, our SGA expenses were slightly higher than 2009 due to the impact of maintaining compensation levels for our U.S. CRM sales force, despite the reduction in our net sales of our CRM products in the U.S. We plan to increase our investment in SGA in 2011 to introduce new products; strengthen our sales organization in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and India; and to support our acquired businesses; as a result, our SGA expenses are likely to increase slightly as a percentage of net sales in 2011, as compared to 2010. In 2009, our SGA expenses increased by $46 million, or two percent, as compared to 2008. This increase was related primarily to the addition of direct selling expenses and head count, including expanding our global sales force and an increase in costs associated with various litigation related matters. These increases were partially offset by a benefit from foreign currency fluctuations of approximately $22 million. Research and Development (RD) Expenses In 2010, our RD expenses decreased $96 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was due to the on going re prioritization of RD projects and the re allocation of spending as part of our efforts to focus on products with higher returns, as well as the delay of certain of our clinical trials. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth. In 2009, our RD expenses increased $29 million, or three percent, as compared to 2008. As a percentage of net sales, our RD expenses in 2009 were relatively flat with the prior year. Royalty Expense 53 Table of Contents In 2010, our royalty expense decreased $6 million, or three percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was due primarily to lower sales of our drug eluting coronary stent systems, partially offset by the continued shift in the mix of our drug eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS and PROMUS Element stent systems. The royalty rate applied to sales of these stent systems is, on average, higher than that associated with sales of our TAXUS stent systems. In 2009, our royalty expense decreased $12 million, or six percent, as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in royalty expense of $29 million attributable to the expiration of a CRM royalty agreement during the first quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in royalty expense of $20 million as a result of an increase in sales of our drug eluting stent systems, as well as the shift in the mix of our drug eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS stent system, following its launch in the U.S. in mid 2008. Loss on Program Termination In the second quarter of 2009, we discontinued one of our internal RD programs in order to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result, we recorded a pre tax loss of $16 million, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (formerly FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities), associated with future payments that we believe we remain contractually obligated to make. We continue to focus on developing new technologies that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth in the future and do not believe that the cancellation of this program will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. Amortization Expense Amortization expense was $513 million in 2010, as compared to $511 million in 2009, an increase of $2 million, or less than one percent. This non cash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Amortization expense was $511 million in 2009, as compared to $543 million in 2008, a decrease of $32 million, or six percent. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of certain Interventional Cardiology related intangible assets reaching the end of their accounting useful life during 2008, as well as the write down of certain intangible assets to their fair values in 2009 and 2008, described in Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges below. Goodwill Impairment Charges We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. The ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. ICD and CRT D products, which we announced on March 15, 2010, and the expected corresponding financial impact on our operations created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. CRM reporting unit. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with our accounting policies and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.817 billion, on both a pre tax and after tax basis, associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit. This charge does not impact our compliance with our debt covenants or our cash flows, and is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. At the time we performed our interim goodwill impairment test, we estimated that our U.S. defibrillator market share would decrease approximately 400 basis points exiting 2010 as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions, as compared to our market share exiting 2009, and that these actions would negatively impact our 2010 U.S. CRM revenues by approximately $300 million. In addition, we expected that, our on going U.S. CRM net sales and profitability would likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions. Therefore, as a result of these product actions, as well as lower expectations of market growth in new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures, we lowered our estimated average U.S. CRM net sales growth rates within our 15 year discounted cash flow (DCF) model, as well as our terminal 54 Table of Contents value growth rate, by approximately a couple of hundred basis points to derive the fair value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit. The reduction in our forecasted 2010 U.S. CRM net sales, the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device manufacturers were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Partially offsetting these factors was a 50 basis point reduction in our estimated market participant risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) used in determining our discount rate. In the second quarter of 2010, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. We updated our U.S. CRM assumptions to reflect our market share position at that time, our most recent operational budgets and long range strategic plans. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of our U.S. CRM reporting unit. Based on the remaining book value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge, the carrying value of our U.S. CRM business unit continues to exceed its fair value, due primarily to the book value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit. The book value of our amortizable intangible assets which have been allocated to our U.S. CRM reporting unit is approximately $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2010. We tested these amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis as of March 31, 2010, and determined that these assets were not impaired, and there have been no impairment indicators related to these assets subsequent to that test. The assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test related to our U.S. CRM reporting unit were substantially consistent with those used in our first quarter interim impairment test; therefore, it was not deemed necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test in the second quarter of 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we performed an interim impairment test on our international reporting units as a result of the announced divestiture of our Neurovascular business. We allocated a portion of our goodwill from our each of our international reporting units to the Neurovascular business. We then tested each of our international reporting units for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. Our testing did not identify any reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their calculated fair values. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates for a discussion of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2010, including our assessment of reporting units with a higher risk of future impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test and recorded a $2.613 billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit. The impact of economic conditions, and the related increase in volatility in the equity and credit markets, on our risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital, along with reductions in market demand for products in our U.S. CRM reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of our acquisition of Guidant, were the key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Intangible Asset Impairment Charges During the first quarter of 2010, due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our Peripheral Interventions technology offerings, as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this technology, we lowered our sales forecasts associated with the product. In addition, during the third quarter of 2010, as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio, we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result of these factors, we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded $65 million of intangible asset impairment charges during 2010 to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value. We do not believe that these impairments, or the factors causing these impairments, will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows. In 2009, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $12 million, associated primarily with lower than anticipated market penetration of one of our Urology technology offerings. We do not believe that these impairments will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows. 55 Table of Contents In 2008, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $177 million, including a $131 million write down of certain of our Peripheral Interventions related intangible assets, and a $46 million write down of certain Urology related intangible assets. We do not believe that the write down of these assets will have a material impact on future operations or cash flows. These non cash charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates and Note D Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our intangible asset impairment charges. Purchased Research and Development On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations (codified within ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations). Among other changes to accounting for business combinations, Statement No. 141(R) superseded FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date. Statement No. 141(R) now requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be recognized as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Accordingly, we have accounted for purchased research and development acquired in connection with our 2010 business combinations as intangible assets in our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our policy is to record certain costs associated with strategic investments outside of business combinations as purchased research and development. Our adoption of Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805) did not change this policy with respect to asset purchases. In accordance with this policy, we recorded purchased research and development charges of $21 million in 2009, associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements. Since the technology purchases did not involve the transfer of processes or outputs as defined by Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805), the transactions did not qualify as business combinations. In 2008, we recorded $43 million of purchased research and development charges, including $17 million associated with our acquisition of Labcoat, Ltd., $8 million attributable to our acquisition of CryoCor, Inc., and $18 million associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements. These acquisition related charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Contingent Consideration Expense In connection with our 2010 acquisitions, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue based milestones. As of the respective acquisition dates, we recorded total contingent liabilities of $69 million, representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired businesses. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, we re measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates. During 2010, we recorded expense of $2 million representing the increase in the estimated fair value of this obligation. This acquisition related charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Acquisition related Milestone In connection with Abbott Laboratories 2006 acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott agreed to pay us a milestone payment of $250 million upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to market the XIENCE V stent system in Japan. The MHLW approved the XIENCE V stent system in the first quarter of 2010 and we received the 56 Table of Contents milestone payment from Abbott, which we recorded as a $250 million pre tax gain. This non recurring acquisition related credit is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Gain on Divestitures During 2008, we recorded a $250 million gain in connection with the sale of our Fluid Management and Venous Access businesses and our TriVascular EVAR program. This divestiture related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Refer to Note C Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these transactions. Restructuring Charges and Restructuring related Activities In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan). The plan was intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value. Key activities under the plan included the restructuring of several businesses, corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination, suspension or reduction of spending on certain research and development projects; and the transfer of certain production lines among facilities. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008. We have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases, primarily in customer facing positions. In addition, the plan has reduced annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs by approximately $35 million exiting 2010 as a result of transfers of certain production lines. We initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007. The transfer of certain production lines contemplated under the 2007 Restructuring plan was completed as of December 31, 2010; all other major activities under the plan, with the exception of final production line transfers, were completed as of December 31, 2009. The execution of this plan resulted in total pre tax expenses of $427 million and required cash outlays of $380 million, of which we have paid $370 million to date. We recorded a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost: Type of cost Total amount incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $204 million Fixed asset write offs $31 million Other (1) $67 million Restructuring related expenses: Retention incentives $66 million Accelerated depreciation $16 million Transfer costs (2) $43 million $427 million (1) Consists primarily of consulting fees, contractual cancellations, relocation costs and other costs. (2) Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines among facilities, including costs of transfer teams, freight and product line validations. In January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, discussed above, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. We estimate that the program will result in annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the estimated $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing 57 Table of Contents costs from activities under our 2007 Restructuring plan. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. We expect that the execution of the Plant Network Optimization program will result in total pre tax charges of approximately $135 million to $150 million, and that approximately $115 million to $125 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $40 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $79 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of our estimates of costs associated with the Plant Network Optimization program by major type of cost: Total estimated amount expected to Type of cost be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $30 million to $35 million Restructuring related expenses: Accelerated depreciation $20 million to $25 million Transfer costs (1) $85 million to $90 million $135 million to $150 million (1) Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines among facilities, including costs of transfer teams, freight, idle facility and product line validations. On February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the centralization of our research and development organization; the re alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre tax operating expenses of approximately $200 million to $250 million, once completed in 2012. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. We expect the execution of the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately 1,000 to 1,300 positions worldwide by the end of 2012. We estimate that the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in total pre tax charges of approximately $180 million to $200 million, and that approximately $165 million to $175 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $69 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $110 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost: 58 Table of Contents Total estimated amount expected to Type of cost be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $95 million to $100 million Fixed asset write offs $10 million to $15 million Other (1) $55 million to $60 million Restructuring related expenses: Other (2) $20 million to $25 million $180 million to $200 million (1) Includes primarily consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations. (2) Comprised of other costs directly related to restructuring plan, including accelerated depreciation and infrastructure related costs. We recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plans of $116 million during 2010, $63 million during 2009, and $78 million during 2008. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $53 million during 2010, $67 million during 2009, and $55 million during 2008. The following presents these costs by major type and line item within our 2010 consolidated statements of operations included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, as well as by program: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write offs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 70 $ 11 $ 35 $ 116 Restructuring related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 7 $ 41 48 Selling, general and administrative expenses 5 5 Research and development expenses 7 41 5 53 $ 70 $ 7 $ 41 $ 11 $ 40 $ 169 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write offs Other Total 2010 Restructuring plan $ 66 $ 11 $ 33 $ 110 Plant Network Optimization program 4 $ 7 $ 28 39 2007 Restructuring plan 13 7 20 $ 70 $ 7 $ 41 $ 11 $ 40 $ 169 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write offs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 34 $ 13 $ 16 $ 63 Restructuring related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 5 $ 8 $ 37 50 Selling, general and administrative expenses 10 3 1 14 Research and development expenses 3 3 18 11 37 1 67 $ 34 $ 18 $ 11 $ 37 $ 13 $ 17 $ 130 59 Table of Contents Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write offs Other Total Plant Network Optimization program $ 22 $ 6 $ 12 $ 40 2007 Restructuring plan 12 $ 18 5 25 $ 13 $ 17 90 $ 34 $ 18 $ 11 $ 37 $ 13 $ 17 $ 130 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write offs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 34 $ 10 $ 34 $ 78 Restructuring related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 9 $ 4 $ 4 17 Selling, general and administrative expenses 27 4 31 Research and development expenses 7 7 43 8 4 55 $ 34 $ 43 $ 8 $ 4 $ 10 $ 34 $ 133 Restructuring and restructuring related costs recorded in 2008 related entirely to our 2007 Restructuring plan. Termination benefits represent amounts incurred pursuant to our on going benefit arrangements and amounts for one time involuntary termination benefits, and have been recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 712, Compensation Non retirement Postemployment Benefits (formerly FASB Statement No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits) and ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (formerly FASB Statement 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities). We expect to record additional termination benefits related to our Plant Network Optimization program and 2010 Restructuring plan in 2011 and 2012 when we identify with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated. Retention incentives represent cash incentives, which were recorded over the service period during which eligible employees remained employed with us in order to retain the payment. Other restructuring costs, which represent primarily consulting fees, are being recorded as incurred in accordance with Topic 420. Accelerated depreciation is being recorded over the adjusted remaining useful life of the related assets, and production line transfer costs are being recorded as incurred. We have incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $433 million and restructuring related costs of $183 million since we committed to each plan. The following presents these costs by major type and by plan: 2010 Plant 2007 Restructuring Network Restructuring (in millions) plan Optimization plan Total Termination benefits $ 66 $ 26 $ 204 $ 296 Fixed asset write offs 11 31 42 Other 28 67 95 Total restructuring charges 105 26 302 433 Retention incentives 66 66 Accelerated depreciation 13 16 29 Transfer costs 40 43 83 Other 5 5 Restructuring related expenses 5 53 125 183 $ 110 $ 79 $ 427 $ 616 60 Table of Contents We made total cash payments associated with restructuring initiatives pursuant to these plans of $133 million during 2010 and have made total cash payments of $479 million since committing to each plan. Each of these payments was made using cash generated from operations, and are comprised of the following: 2010 Plant 2007 Restructuring Network Restructuring (in millions) plan Optimization plan Total Year Ended December 31, 2010 Termination benefits $ 45 $ 16 $ 61 Retention incentives 2 2 Transfer costs $ 28 13 41 Other 24 5 29 $ 69 $ 28 $ 36 $ 133 Program to Date Termination benefits $ 45 $ 195 $ 240 Retention incentives 66 66 Transfer costs $ 40 43 83 Other 24 66 90 $ 69 $ 40 $ 370 $ 479 Litigation related Net Charges We record certain significant litigation related activity as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations, and these charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. During 2010, we reached a settlement with Medinol Ltd., resolving the dispute we had with them that had been subject of arbitration before the American Arbitration Association. Under the terms of the settlement, we received proceeds of $104 million from Medinol, which we recorded as a pre tax gain in our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In 2009, we recorded litigation related net charges of $2.022 billion, associated primarily with an agreement to settle three patent disputes with Johnson Johnson for $1.725 billion, plus interest. In addition, in 2009, we reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice, which was formally accepted by the District Court in 2011, under which we paid $296 million in January 2011 in order resolve the U.S. Government investigation of Guidant Corporation related to product advisories issued in 2005. We recorded a net charge of $294 million related to this matter in 2009, representing $296 million associated with the agreement, net of a $2 million reversal of a related accrual. Further, in 2009, we reduced previously recorded reserves associated with certain litigation related matters following certain favorable court rulings, resulting in a credit of $60 million and recorded a pre tax charge of $50 million associated with the settlement of all outstanding litigation with Bruce Saffran, M.D., Ph.D. In 2008, we recorded litigation related charges of $334 million as a result of a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by Johnson Johnson. This charge was in addition to previous charges related to this matter. In 2009, we made the associated settlement payment of $716 million, including penalties and interest. See discussion of our material legal proceedings in Note L Commitments and Contingencies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Interest Expense Our interest expense decreased to $393 million in 2010, as compared to $407 million in 2009. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to term loan prepayments throughout 2009, as well as the 2010 prepayment of our $900 million loan from Abbott Laboratories and a slight decrease in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.0 percent in 2010 and 6.1 percent in 2009. In addition, our 2010 interest expense included $15 million of write offs of debt issuance costs and impacts of the early termination of interest rate contracts associated with term loan prepayments during the year, as compared to $34 million in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by the write off of the related remaining $10 million discount attributable to 61 Table of Contents the Abbott loan upon prepayment. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Note G Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations. Our interest expense decreased to $407 million in 2009, as compared to $468 million in 2008. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to term loan repayments during 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases were losses of $27 million associated with the early termination of interest rate contracts for which there was no longer an underlying exposure and the write off of $7 million of debt issuance costs following prepayments of our term loan, as well as a slight increase in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.1 percent in 2009 and 6.0 percent in 2008. Other, net Our other, net reflected expense of $14 million in 2010, $7 million in 2009, and $58 million in 2008. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ 13 $ 7 $ 47 Foreign currency (losses) gains (9 ) (5 ) 5 Net (losses) gains on investments and notes receivable (12 ) 3 (93 ) Other expense, net (6 ) (12 ) (17 ) $ (14 ) $ (7 ) $ (58 ) Our interest income increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the collection of interest on outstanding accounts receivable. Our interest income decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower average investment rates available in the market, as well as lower average cash balances. Other, net included net losses of $12 million in 2010, net gains of $3 million in 2009 and net losses of $93 million in 2008, associated with our investment portfolio. The $93 million of losses in 2008 relate primarily to the sale of our non strategic investments, described in Note F Investments and Notes Receivable to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Tax Rate The following provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 2008 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Reported tax rate 0.2 % (21.6 ) % 0.2 % 21.8 % (21.8 ) % Impact of certain receipts/ charges 18.0 % 39.1 % 18.9 % (21.1 ) % 20.2 % 18.2 % 17.5 % 19.1 % 0.7 % (1.6 ) % The change in our reported tax rate for 2010, as compared to 2009, and 2009, as compared to 2008, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2010, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisition related milestone payment, a gain associated with a litigation related settlement receipt, and restructuring related charges. Our reported tax rate was also net favorably affected by discrete items, related primarily to the re measurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third party case, a resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third party case as well as conclusion of the appeals process for the federal examination for certain years. In 2009, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, purchased research and development charges, restructuring and litigation related net charges, a favorable tax ruling on a divestiture related gain recognized in a prior period, and discrete tax items associated primarily with resolutions of uncertain tax positions related to audit settlements and changes in estimates for tax benefits 62 Table of Contents claimed related to prior periods. In 2008, these charges included gains and losses associated with the divestiture of certain non strategic businesses and investments, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, litigation related charges. Changes in the geographic mix of our sales also impacted our reported tax rate in 2010, as compared to 2009, and in 2009, as compared to 2008. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters through 2001. We resolved a number of foreign examinations during 2010. As a result of these activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $9 million, inclusive of $3 million of interest and penalties. In addition, as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in various foreign and state jurisdictions, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $20 million, inclusive of $7 million of interest and penalties. Further, during 2010, we concluded the appeals process for the federal tax examination for Boston Scientific (excluding Guidant) covering years 2002 2005 and decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $72 million, inclusive of $21 million of interest and penalties, net of payments. We also re measured an uncertain tax position due to a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third party case and resolved another uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third party case, which resulted in a decrease of $91 million, inclusive of $25 million of interest and penalties. During 2009, we received favorable foreign court decisions and resolved certain foreign matters. As a result of these activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $20 million, inclusive of $7 million of interest and penalties. In addition, statutes of limitations expired in various foreign and state jurisdictions, as a result, decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $29 million, inclusive of interest and penalties. We also resolved certain litigation related matters, described in our 2009 Annual Report filed on Form 10 K. Based on the outcome of the settlements, we reassessed the reserve for uncertain tax positions previously recorded on certain positions and decreased our reserve by $22 million, inclusive of $1 million of interest. During 2008, we resolved certain matters in federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions for Guidant and Boston Scientific for the years 1998 2005. We settled multiple federal issues at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination and Appellate levels, including issues related to Guidants acquisition of Intermedics, Inc., and various litigation settlements, described in Note L Commitments and Contingencies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, or our 2009 Annual Report filed on Form 10 K. We also received favorable foreign court decisions and a favorable outcome related to our foreign research credit claims. As a result of these audit activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding tax payments, by $156 million, inclusive of $37 million of interest and penalties. On December 17, 2010, we received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for the 2001 2003 tax years. The incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS is $525 million, plus interest. The primary issue in dispute is the transfer pricing used in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we intend to file a petition to the U.S. Tax Court in early 2011. No payments will be made on the issue until it is resolved, which may take several years. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with this matter are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, both the final resolution and potential impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The federal tax returns of Guidant Corporation for the 2004 through April 2006 tax years and of Boston Scientific Corporation for the 2006 2007 tax years are currently under examination by the IRS. The relevant statutes of limitations for these examinations expire during December 2011 and September 2011, respectively. We do not anticipate that at the conclusion of these examinations, we will be able to reach an agreement with the IRS regarding our federal tax liabilities for these years. We expect that final resolution of these tax liabilities will require that we avail ourselves of applicable IRS appellate and judicial procedures, as appropriate. 63 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2010, we had $213 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $105 million invested in prime money market and government funds, $16 million invested in short term time deposits, and $92 million in interest bearing and non interest bearing bank accounts. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal, and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. Subsequent to year end, in January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation and received pre tax proceeds of $1.450 billion at closing, including an upfront payment of $1.426 billion, and $24 million, which was placed into escrow to be released upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions, and will receive $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will be completed over a period of approximately 24 months. In January 2011, we paid at maturity $250 million of our senior notes, and a $296 million litigation related settlement associated with the U.S. Department of Justice matter described previously, using cash on hand. We also have full access to our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. The following provides a summary and description of our cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by operating activities $ 325 $ 835 $ 1,216 Cash (used for) provided by investing activities (480 ) (793 ) 324 Cash used for financing activities (496 ) (820 ) (1,350 ) Operating Activities During 2010, cash provided by operating activities was $325 million, as compared to $835 million in 2009, a decrease of $510 million. This decrease was driven primarily by the payment of $1.725 billion to Johnson Johnson related to a patent litigation settlement, as compared to approximately $837 million of legal settlements paid in 2009. This cash outflow was partially offset by the receipt of a $250 million milestone payment from Abbott and $104 million received in connection with a litigation settlement with Medinol, each described in Results of Operations. During 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $835 million, as compared to $1.216 billion in 2008, a decrease of $381 million. This decrease was due primarily to litigation related payments of $837 million, consisting primarily of payments to Johnson Johnson associated with patent litigation settlements. These cash outflows were partially offset by lower net tax payments of $370 million and lower interest payments of $50 million, due to lower average debt balances, as well as improvements in working capital. Investing Activities During 2010, our investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of $272 million, as well as payments of approximately $200 million to acquire Asthmatx, Inc. and certain other strategic assets, described in Note B Acquisitions to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million to $350 million during 2011, which includes capital expenditures to further upgrade our information systems infrastructure, and to enhance our manufacturing capabilities to support continued growth in our business units. During 2009, our investing activities included $523 million of payments related to prior period acquisitions, comprised primarily of a final fixed payment of approximately $500 million related to our prior period acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation, described in Note B Acquisitions to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our investing activities in 2009 also included capital expenditures of $312 million, payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of 64 Table of Contents businesses and certain technology rights of $54 million, which were offset by proceeds from the sale of investments in, and collection of notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and privately held companies, of $91 million. During 2008, our investing activities included proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion associated with the divestiture of certain businesses, and $149 million of proceeds associated with the sale of investments and collections of notes receivable. These cash inflows were partially offset by $675 million in payments related to prior period acquisitions, associated primarily with Advanced Bionics; and $39 million of net cash payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of certain technology rights. In addition, we made capital expenditures of $362 million and paid $21 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire CryoCor, Inc. and $17 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Labcoat, Ltd. Refer to Note F Investments and Notes Receivable and Note B Acquisitions to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding these transactions. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs. Debt We made payments on debt, net of proceeds from borrowings, of $527 million in 2010, $853 million in 2009, and $1.425 billion in 2008, and had total debt of $5.438 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $5.918 billion as of December 31, 2009. The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2010 is as follows: (in millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Term loan $ 250 $ 50 $ 700 $ 1,000 Senior notes 250 $ 600 $ 1,250 $ 2,350 4,450 $ 500 $ 50 $ 700 $ 600 $ 1,250 $ 2,350 $ 5,450 Note: The table above does not include discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes. There were no amounts borrowed under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit of $120 million, as compared to $123 million as of December 31, 2009, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees; accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 or 2009. We believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations and intend to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit. In January 2011, we paid at maturity $250 million of our senior notes; in addition, we borrowed $250 million under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables and used the proceeds to pre pay all $100 million of our 2011 term loan maturities and $150 million of our 2012 term loan maturities. These prepayments are reflected as current in the table above, as well as in our consolidated balance sheets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As a result, quarterly principal payments of $50 million will commence in the fourth quarter of 2012. 65 Table of Contents Our revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows: Actual as of Covenant December 31, Requirement 2010 Maximum leverage ratio (1) 3.85 times 2.3 times Minimum interest coverage ratio (2) 3.0 times 6.1 times (1) Ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. Requirement decreases to 3.5 times after March 31, 2011. (2) Ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. The credit agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, through the credit agreement maturity, of up to $258 million in restructuring charges and restructuring related expenses related to our previously announced restructuring plans, plus an additional $300 million for any future restructuring initiatives. As of December 31, 2010, we had $470 million of the aggregate restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any litigation related charges and credits are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA until such items are paid or received; as well as up to $1.5 billion of any future cash payments for future litigation settlements or damage awards (net of any litigation payments received); and litigation related cash payments (net of cash receipts) of up to $1.310 billion related to amounts that were recorded in the financial statements as of March 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had $2.154 billion of the aggregate legal payment exclusion remaining. As of and through December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Our inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers. Equity During 2010, we received $31 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $33 million in 2009 and $71 million in 2008. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees. Stock based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was $150 million in 2010, $144 million in 2009, and $138 million in 2008. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2010. Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Litigation settlements $ 296 $ 296 Long term debt obligations 500 $ 50 $ 700 $ 600 $ 1,250 $ 2,350 5,450 Interest payments (1) 286 280 262 229 193 1,300 2,550 Operating lease obligations (1) 83 69 46 24 15 45 282 Purchase obligations (1) 205 51 8 4 1 2 271 Minimum royalty obligations (1) 13 1 1 1 1 3 20 Unrecognized tax benefits 8 8 $ 1,391 $ 451 $ 1,017 $ 858 $ 1,460 $ 3,700 $ 8,877 (1) In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. 66 Table of Contents The litigation settlement obligation noted above relates to our settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for $296 million, discussed in Note L Commitments and Contingencies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, and was paid in January 2011. Refer to Note G Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our debt obligations and associated interest obligations. The amounts in the table above with respect to operating lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations relate primarily to non cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.242 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note K Income Taxes to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration, including our 2010 acquisition of Asthmatx, Inc. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B Acquisitions to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions. Legal Matters The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician customers, particularly in interventional cardiology, have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions. In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies. Several third parties have asserted that certain of our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that other products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson Johnson, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, particularly relating to drug eluting stent systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operation or liquidity. In the normal course of business, product liability, securities and commercial claims are asserted against us. Similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. We are substantially self insured with respect to product liability claims and intellectual property infringement, and maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims. The absence 67 Table of Contents of significant third party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation, and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $588 million as of December 31, 2010 and $2.316 billion as of December 31, 2009, and includes estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense. The decrease in our accrual is due primarily to the payment of $1.725 billion to Johnson Johnson in connection with the patent litigation settlement discussed in Note L Commitments and Contingencies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Note L. Critical Accounting Estimates Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). We describe these accounting polices in Note ASignificant Accounting Policies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring managements judgment that we consider critical: Revenue Recognition We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates. Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. In accordance with accounting guidance regarding multiple element arrangements applicable through December 31, 2010, we deferred revenue on the undelivered service element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value, using the residual method of allocation, and recognized the associated revenue over the related service period. The use of an alternative method of allocation or estimate of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral in any given period. On January 1, 2011, we adopted ASC Update No. 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. The consensus in Update No. 2009 13 supersedes certain guidance in Topic 605 (formerly Emerging 68 Table of Contents Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Multiple Element Arrangements). Update No. 2009 13 provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables, including requiring the use of the relative selling price method. The adoption of Update No. 2009 13 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. Inventory Provisions We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory. Valuation of Intangible Assets We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including purchased research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods. We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, as discussed in Note A, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. In addition, we test our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets. To test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment, we calculate the fair value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value. We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. Goodwill Valuation We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two step approach prescribed under ASC 69 Table of Contents Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (formerly FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our April 1, 2010 annual impairment assessment, we identified our reporting units to be our seven U.S. operating segments, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment, and our four international operating segments. When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting units operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units. In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market participant risk adjusted weighted average costs of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated, we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates. We have identified a total of four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM unit, which holds $1.5 billion of allocated goodwill, our U.S. Cardiovascular unit, which holds $2.2 billion of allocated goodwill, our U.S. Neuromodulation unit, which holds $1.2 billion of allocated 70 Table of Contents goodwill, and our EMEA unit, which holds $3.9 billion of allocated goodwill. The level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. CRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) ranged from approximately six percent to 23 percent. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect changes that would warrant an interim impairment test. The key variables that drive the fair value of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates, levels of profitability and perpetual growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. For each of these reporting units, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a 50 basis point increase in the WACC applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM, U.S. Neuromodulation, and EMEA reporting units failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. In addition, keeping all other variables constant, a 100 basis point decrease in perpetual growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for all four of the reporting units with higher risk of impairment. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates are our best estimates and we believe they are reasonable, but future declines in the business performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill. See Note D Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our 2010 and 2008 goodwill impairment charges, as well as a discussion of future events that could have a negative impact on the fair value of these reporting units. Income Taxes We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of these matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. New Accounting Pronouncements Standards Implemented ASC Update No. 2010 06 In January 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010 06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. Update No. 2010 06 requires additional disclosure within the rollforward of activity for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the separate presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of assets and liabilities within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Update No. 2010 06 requires enhanced disclosures of the valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements within Level 2 and Level 3. We adopted Update No. 2010 06 for our first quarter ended March 31, 2010, except for the disclosure of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 measurements, for which disclosures will be required for our first quarter ending March 31, 2011. During 2010, we did not have any transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note E Fair Value Measurements to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for 71 Table of Contents disclosures surrounding our fair value measurements, including information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used in fair value measurements for assets and liabilities within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. ASC Update No. 2009 17 In December 2009, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2009 17, Consolidations (Topic 810) Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which formally codifies FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). Update No. 2009 17 and Statement No. 167 amend Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to require that an enterprise perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE). The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Update No. 2009 17 eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary. We adopted Update No. 2009 17 for our first quarter ended March 31, 2010. The adoption of Update No. 2009 17 did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial position. ASC Update No. 2010 20 In July 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010 20, Receivables (Topic 310) Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. Update No. 2010 20 requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures about financing receivables, including trade accounts receivable, with respect to credit quality and credit losses, including a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses. The enhanced disclosure requirements are generally effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2010. We adopted Update No. 2010 20 for our year ended December 31, 2010, except for the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, for which disclosure will be required for our first quarter ending March 31, 2011. Refer to Note A Significant Account Policies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for disclosures surrounding concentrations of credit risk and our policies with respect to the monitoring of the credit quality of customer accounts. Standards to be Implemented ASC Update No. 2009 13 In October 2009, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605 ) Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. The consensus in Update No. 2009 13 supersedes certain guidance in Topic 605 (formerly EITF Issue No. 00 21, Multiple Element Arrangements). Update No. 2009 13 provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. Update No. 2009 13 also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. We adopted Update No. 2009 13 as of January 1, 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. ASC Update No. 2010 29 In December 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010 29, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. Update No. 2010 29 clarifies paragraph 805 10 50 2(h) to require public entities that enter into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis to disclose pro forma information for such business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period, including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the acquisition date had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. We are required to adopt Update No. 2010 29 for material business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011. 72 Table of Contents Additional Information Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures Use and Economic Substance of Non GAAP Financial Measures Used by Boston Scientific To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non GAAP measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange. These non GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss); the GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share. To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, we convert actual current period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign exchange rates. The GAAP measure most comparable to this non GAAP measure is growth rate percentages based on GAAP revenue. Reconciliations of each of these non GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measure are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management uses these supplemental non GAAP measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources and determining compensation. In addition, management uses these non GAAP measures to further its understanding of the performance of operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non GAAP measures are consistent with those excluded from our reportable segments measure of profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our Chief Operating Decision Maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance. The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of its non GAAP measures for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items: Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges These amounts represent non cash write downs of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management business, as well as certain intangible assets balances. Following our acquisition of Guidant Corporation in 2006, and the related increase in debt, we have heightened our focus on cash generation and debt pay down. We remove the impact of these charges from operating performance to assist in assessing cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric in measuring our ability to generate cash and pay down debt. Therefore, these charges are excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and are also excluded from the measures used to set employee compensation. Accordingly, management believes this may be useful information to users of its financial statements and therefore has excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. 73 Table of Contents Acquisition related charges (credits) These adjustments consist of (a) purchased research and development charges, (b) contingent consideration expense, (c) gains on acquisition related milestone receipts, (d) due diligence and other fees, and (e) inventory step up adjustments. Purchased research and development is a highly variable charge based on the extent and nature of external technology acquisitions during the period. Contingent consideration expense represents accounting adjustments to state our contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood of making future contingent consideration payments. In addition, contingent consideration expense was not recognized based on accounting principles in place previous to 2009, and, therefore, is not comparable to periods prior to 2009. Acquisition related gains resulted from receipts related to Guidant Corporations sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott Laboratories, and are not indicative of future operating results. Due diligence and other fees include legal, tax and other one time expenses associated with recent acquisitions that are not representative of on going operations. Inventory step up adjustments are non cash charges related to acquired inventory directly attributable to acquisitions and is not indicative of the our on going operations, or on going cost of products sold. Management therefore removes the impact of these (credits) charges from our operating results to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance. Divestiture related charges (credits) These amounts represent fees associated with business divestitures and gains and related tax impacts that we recognized related to the sale of certain non strategic investments. These gains and losses are not indicative of future operating performance and are not used by management to assess operating performance. Accordingly, management excludes these amounts for purposes of calculating these non GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance. Restructuring and restructuring related costs These adjustments represent costs associated with our 2010 Restructuring plan, Plant Network Optimization program and 2007 Restructuring plan. These expenses are excluded by management in assessing operating performance, as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance. Litigation related net (credits) charges These amounts are attributable to certain significant patent litigation and other legal matters, none of which reflect expected on going operating expenses. Accordingly, management excluded these (credits) charges for purposes of calculating these non GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and for comparison to past operating performance. Discrete tax items These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods as a result of acquisition , divestiture , restructuring or litigation related charges (credits). These adjustments do not reflect expected on going operating results. Accordingly, management excludes these amounts for purposes of calculating these non GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and for comparison to past operating performance. Amortization expense Amortization expense is a non cash charge and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our debt agreements. Management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing cash generated from operations. Management believes this is a critical metric in measuring our ability to generate cash and pay down debt. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation. Accordingly, management believes this may be useful information to users of its financial statements and therefore excludes amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. 74 Table of Contents Foreign exchange on net sales The impact of foreign exchange is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of foreign exchange for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange may have limitations as analytical tools, and these non GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for GAAP financial measures. Some of the limitations associated with the use of these non GAAP financial measures are: Amortization expense and goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, though not directly affecting our cash flows, represent a net reduction in value of goodwill and other intangible assets. The net loss associated with this reduction in value is not included in our adjusted net income or adjusted net income per diluted share and therefore these measures do not reflect the full effect of the reduction in value of those assets. Acquisition and divestiture related charges (credits) reflect economic costs and benefits and are not reflected in adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. Items such as restructuring and restructuring related costs, litigation related net (credits) charges, and discrete tax items that are excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share can have a material impact on cash flows and GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted share. Revenue growth rates stated on a constant currency basis, by their nature, exclude the impact of foreign exchange, which may have a material impact on GAAP net sales. Other companies may calculate adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, or regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange differently than us, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Compensation for Limitations Associated with Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures We compensate for the limitations on non GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of performance. The non GAAP measures focus instead upon the core business, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of overall performance. We provide detailed reconciliations of each non GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure elsewhere in this Annual Report, and encourage investors to review these reconciliations. Usefulness of Non GAAP Financial Measures to Investors We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, in addition to the related GAAP measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management. We further believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and to evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. Rule 10b5 1 Trading Plans Periodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5 1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and our own Stock Trading Policy.

We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ J. Raymond Elliott /s/ Jeffrey D. Capello J. Raymond Elliott Jeffrey D. Capello President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 77 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited Boston Scientific Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 17, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 17, 2011 78 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $5.077 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $4.742 billion as of December 31, 2009. We recorded $82 million of other assets and $189 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2010, as compared to $56 million of other assets and $110 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2009. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $297 million as of December 31, 2010 and $271 million as of December 31, 2009. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $363 million as of December 31, 2010 and by $331 million as of December 31, 2009. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations. Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings, partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments, or net debt. As of December 31, 2010, $4.433 billion of our outstanding debt obligations, or approximately 85 percent of our net debt, was at fixed interest rates. We did not have any interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2010 or 2009. In the first quarter of 2011, we entered interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $850 million to convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. See Note E Fair Value Measurements to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 79 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 17, 2011 80 Table of Contents
