ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Executive SummaryFinancial Highlights and TrendsIn 2011, we generated net sales of $7.622 billion, as compared to $7.806 billion in 2010, a decrease of $184 million, or two percent. Our sales declined approximately $200 million as a result of the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011; offsetting this decline was the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $204 million to our net sales in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales decreased $182 million, or two percent, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to constant currency declines in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology division of $180 million and constant currency declines in net sales from our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business of $144 million. These decreases were partially offset by constant currency increases in net sales from our Endoscopy business of $69 million, net sales from our Peripheral Interventions business of $36 million, and net sales from our Neuromodulation business of $31 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year.1 In addition, our 2010 net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $120 million as a result of the 2010 U.S. CRM ship hold. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our sales results and the 2010 U.S. CRM ship hold.Our reported net income in 2011 was $441 million, or $0.29 per share. Our reported results for 2011 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition , divestiture , restructuring and litigation related charges and credits; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after tax) of $577 million, or $0.38 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2011 was $1.018 billion, or $0.67 per share. Our reported net loss in 2010 was $1.065 billion, or $0.70 per share. Our reported results for 2010 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition , divestiture , restructuring and litigation related charges and credits; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after tax) of $2.116 billion, or $1.39 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2010 was $1.051 billion, or $0.69 per share. The following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to those adjusted results considered by management.

Our operating cash flows included approximately $300 million of litigation related net payments in 2011, as compared to approximately $1.6 billion in 2010; in addition, in 2010 we received an acquisition related milestone payment of $250 million. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth and returning value to shareholders by buying back shares of our common stock, pursuant to our share repurchase authorizations discussed in Note L Stockholders Equity to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. During 2011, we used $492 million of cash generated from operations to repurchase approximately 82 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, we had total debt of $4.261 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $267 million and working capital of $1.298 billion. During 2011, we prepaid the remaining $1.0 billion of our term loan and paid $250 million of our senior notes at maturity. In July 2011, Fitch Ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to BBB , an investment grade rating; and in February 2012, Moodys Investors Service upgraded our corporate credit rating to Baa3, an investment grade rating. In addition, Standard & Poors Rating Services has maintained an investment grade corporate credit rating for us since 2009. We believe these rating improvements reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows, the reduction of our debt, and our improved financial fundamentals. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion.Business and Market OverviewCoronary Stent SystemsWe are the only company in the industry to offer a two drug platform strategy, which we believe has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the drug eluting stent market. We market our next generation internally developed and self manufactured PROMUS Element drug eluting stent platform in the U.S., our Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) region and certain Inter Continental countries, including China beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. We market our PROMUS everolimus eluting stent system, supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories in Japan. We expect to launch our PROMUS Element stent system in Japan at or before mid 2012. We also offer our TAXUS paclitaxel eluting stent line, including our third generation TAXUS Element stent system in the U.S., Japan, EMEA and certain Inter Continental countries. Our Element stent platform incorporates a unique platinum chromium alloy designed to offer greater radial strength and flexibility, enhanced visibility and reduced recoil, compared to older alloys. The innovative stent design improves deliverability and allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution. These product offerings demonstrate our commitment to drug eluting stent market leadership and continued innovation. Our coronary stent system offerings also include the VeriFLEX (Libert) bare metal coronary stent system and our third generation OMEGA platinum chromium bare metal coronary stent system. Net sales of our coronary stent systems, including bare metal stent systems, of $1.620 billion represented approximately 21 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011. Worldwide net sales of these products decreased $50 million, or three percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed $45 million to our coronary stent system net sales in 2011, as compared to the prior year, net sales of these products decreased $95 million, or six percent. Despite continued competition and pricing pressures, we maintained our leadership position during 2011 with an estimated 35 percent share of the worldwide drug eluting stent market. During the second quarter of 2011, one of our competitors announced plans to exit the drug eluting stent market. Although the full impact on the market remains uncertain, we believe this 35Table of Contentspresents an opportunity for us to expand our presence in the worldwide drug eluting stent market and the broader cardiovascular market.The following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalTAXUS $281 $139 $420 $277 $223 $500PROMUS 459 196 655 528 282 810PROMUS Element 10 424 434 227 227Drug eluting 750 759 1,509 805 732 1,537Bare metal 32 79 111 44 89 133 $782 $838 $1,620 $849 $821 $1,670Our U.S. net sales of drug eluting stent systems decreased $55 million, or seven percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. The decline was due to an overall decrease in the size of the market, resulting principally from lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures, and lower procedural volumes. This decline was partially offset by an increase in our share of the U.S. drug eluting stent market due largely to the launch of our third generation TAXUS Element stent system in the U.S. (commercialized as ION) in the second quarter of 2011. We estimate that the average selling price of drug eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased approximately seven percent in 2011, as compared to 2010 and estimate that the number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed decreased one percent in 2011, as compared to 2010. We believe that average drug eluting stent penetration rates (a measure of the mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents used across procedures) in the U.S. were 77 percent during both 2011 and 2010. In addition, we believe our share of the U.S. drug eluting stent market approximated 48 percent in 2011, as compared to 46 percent in 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we received FDA approval and began launching our next generation, internally developed and self manufactured PROMUS Element everolimus eluting stent platform in the U.S. Our PROMUS Element stent system has significantly higher gross profit and operating profit margins as compared to our PROMUS stent system, which is supplied to us by Abbott, based on the terms of the PROMUS supply arrangement. We expect to fully convert our U.S. drug eluting stent system sales to self manufactured PROMUS Element and TAXUS stent systems during 2012. We believe that our Element platinum chromium stent platform, combined with our two drug platform strategy and broad range of stent sizes, provides a competitive advantage that has allowed us to expand our leadership position in the U.S. drug eluting stent market. Our international drug eluting stent system net sales increased $27 million, or four percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed $41 million to our international drug eluting stent system net sales in 2011, as compared to the prior year, net sales of our drug eluting stent systems decreased $14 million, or two percent. Our net sales of drug eluting stent systems in our Inter Continental region increased $18 million, or nine percent, on a constant currency basis, in 2011, as compared to 2010, driven by sales growth in key emerging markets, including China, Brazil and India. Our net sales of drug eluting stent systems in our EMEA region decreased $4 million, or one percent in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to declines in average selling prices. Net sales of our drug eluting stent systems in Japan decreased $28 million, or 13 percent, on a constant currency basis, in 2011, as compared to 2010, driven primarily by a loss of market share due to competitive launches. We are currently reliant on Abbott Laboratories for our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems in Japan. Our supply agreement with Abbott for everolimus eluting stent systems extends through June 30, 2012. At present, we believe that our supply of everolimus eluting stent systems from Abbott, coupled with our current launch plans for our internally developed and self manufactured next generation PROMUS Element everolimus eluting stent system in Japan, currently expected at or before mid 2012, will be sufficient to meet our customer demand.Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or third parties, or the markets perception of these clinical data, may adversely impact our position in, and share of, the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market.We believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug eluting stent market in the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons, including:36Table of Contentsour two drug platform strategy, including specialty stent sizes;the broad and consistent long term results of our TAXUS clinical trials, and the favorable results of XIENCE V/PROMUS, PROMUS Element and TAXUS Element (ION) stent system clinical trials to date;the performance benefits of our current and future technology;the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products, including our PROMUS Element stent system, launched in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2011 and expected to be launched in Japan at or before mid 2012;our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force; the strength of our clinical, selling, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; andour increased presence and investment in the rapidly growing emerging markets, including China and India. However, a decline in net sales from our drug eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting stent market and our position within this market include, but are not limited to:the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems available in the market;the impact and outcomes of on going and future clinical results involving our or our competitors products, including those trials sponsored by our competitors, or perceived product performance of our or our competitors products;physician and patient confidence in our current and next generation technology;our ability to timely and successfully launch next generation products and technology features, including the PROMUS Element stent system in Japan;changes in drug eluting stent penetration rates, the overall number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed and the average number of stents used per procedure;delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies;new product launches by our competitors; andthe outcome of intellectual property litigation.During 2009, 2010 and 2011, we successfully negotiated closure of several long standing legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters; however, there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation, particularly in the coronary stent market. In particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson & Johnson, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, primarily relating to drug eluting stent systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and or liquidity.Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems)In addition to coronary stent systems, our Interventional Cardiology business markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, as well as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $875 million in 2011, as compared to $932 million in 2010, a decrease of $57 million, or six percent. Our U.S. net sales were $342 million in 2011, as compared to $394 million in 2010. Our international net sales of these products were $533 million in 2011, as compared to $538 million in 2010, and included a $28 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) net sales decreased $85 million, or nine percent, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of competitive pricing pressures, market wide reductions in procedural volumes and market share declines in our IVUS business. We continue to hold a strong leadership position in the PTCA balloon catheter market, with an estimated 53 percent average share of the U.S. market and 30 percent of the worldwide market in 2011. In June 2010, we launched the NC Quantum Apex post dilatation balloon catheter, developed specifically to address physicians needs in optimizing coronary stent deployment, which has been received positively in the market and, in the second half of 2010, also launched our Apex pre dilatation balloon catheter with platinum marker bands for improved radiopacity. 37Table of ContentsAs part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including structural heart therapy. In March 2011, as part of our priority growth initiatives, we completed the acquisition of Atritech, Inc. Atritech has developed a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology, developed by Atritech, is the first device proven in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to anticoagulant drugs, and is approved for use in CE Mark countries. We expect to complete enrollment in our U.S. clinical trial by the end of 2012 and expect to receive FDA approval in 2013. We are integrating the operations of the Atritech business and are leveraging expertise from both our Electrophysiology and Interventional Cardiology divisions in the commercialization of the WATCHMAN device.In addition, in January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. Sadra is developing a fully repositionable and retrievable device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis using its Lotus Valve System, which consists of a stent mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. The low profile delivery system and introducer sheath are designed to enable accurate positioning, repositioning and retrieval at any time prior to release of the aortic valve implant. TAVR is one of the fastest growing medical device markets. Cardiac Rhythm ManagementOur Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) division develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. Our product offerings include our COGNIS cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT D), our TELIGEN ICD systems and our ALTRUA family of pacemaker systems. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we began the U.S. launch of our next generation line of defibrillators, INCEPTA, ENERGEN and PUNCTUA, which are among the worlds smallest and thinnest high energy devices and deliver excellent longevity. This tiered product line includes new features designed to improve functionality, diagnostic capability and ease of use and we expect it will allow us to effectively compete in all segments of the market. Additionally, this next generation of defibrillators includes models with our 4 SITE lead delivery system which is built off our highly reliable RELIANCE platform. We expect to launch the INGENIO family of pacemaker systems in EMEA and in the U.S. during the first half of 2012. This launch would represent our first new major pacemaker system technology introduction in many years and is expected to be the foundation for a series of low voltage pacemaker launches. The INGENIO system includes functionality for remote patient monitoring; features for advanced heart failure diagnostics; and is expected to be compatible with MRI systems in mid 2012 in EMEA, based on our current launch plans.Worldwide net sales of our CRM products of $2.087 billion represented approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011. Our worldwide CRM net sales decreased $93 million, or four percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed $51 million to our 2011 CRM net sales as compared to 2010, our CRM net sales decreased $144 million, or seven percent. The following are the components of our worldwide CRM net sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalICD systems $949 $569 $1,518 $1,037 $562 $1,599Pacemaker systems 279 290 569 320 261 581CRM products $1,228 $859 $2,087 $1,357 $823 $2,180Our U.S. CRM net sales decreased $129 million, or 10 percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. The reduction in our CRM net sales during 2011 reflects the impact of a contraction in the U.S. ICD market. We believe the U.S. ICD market contraction is due to a variety of factors, including physician reaction to study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association regarding evidence based guidelines for ICD implants, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigations into hospitals ICD implant practices and the expansion of Medicare recovery audits, as well as on going physician alignment to hospitals and competitive pricing pressures. In addition, our 2010 net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $120 million as a result of not selling certain of our U.S. CRM products during portions of the first and second quarters of 2010. On March 15, 2010, we announced a ship hold and removal of our field inventory related to our ICD and CRT D systems in the U.S. after determining that certain instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the FDA. During the second quarter of 2010, we submitted the required documentation and received clearance from the FDA for these manufacturing changes and resumed distribution of our ICD and CRT D systems. We believe that the recent launches of our next generation line 38Table of Contentsof defibrillators, and the expected launch of our next generation of INGENIO pacemaker systems in the first half of 2012 in the U.S., will help enhance our position in the U.S. CRM market.Our international CRM net sales increased $36 million, or four percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our international CRM net sales decreased $15 million, or two percent, as compared to the prior year. Our net sales of our CRM products decreased $40 million, or seven percent, in our EMEA region, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to lower average selling prices, driven by competitive and other pricing pressures. This decrease was partially offset by a constant currency increase in net sales of $12 million, or nine percent, in our Inter Continental region in 2011, as compared to 2010. This increase was driven by growth in sales of our pacemaker systems and the continued market acceptance of our COGNIS CRT D and TELIGEN ICD systems, and our 4 SITE lead delivery system, which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our net sales of CRM products in Japan increased $13 million, or 13 percent, on a constant currency basis, as compared to the prior year. We received CE Mark approval for our INCEPTA, ENERGEN and PUNCTUA next generation line of defibrillators in 2011 and we plan to launch our next generation INGENIO family of pacemaker systems in our EMEA and certain Inter Continental regions in the first half of 2012. Net sales from our CRM products represent a significant source of our overall net sales. Therefore, increases or decreases in our CRM net sales could have a significant impact on our results of operations. The variables that may impact the size of the CRM market and or our share of that market include, but are not limited to:the on going impact of physician alignment to hospitals, government investigations and audits of hospitals, and other market and economic conditions on the overall number of procedures performed and average selling prices;our ability to retain and attract key members of our CRM sales force and other key CRM personnel;the ability of CRM manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community, the referring physician community and prospective patients in CRM technologies;future product field actions or new physician advisories issued by us or our competitors;our ability to timely and successfully develop and launch next generation products and technologies worldwide; variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products;delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; andnew product launches by our competitors.EndoscopyOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $1.187 billion in 2011, as compared to $1.079 billion in 2010, an increase of $108 million, or 10 percent, driven by products recently introduced, expanded indications and the increased adoption of our single use products. Our U.S. net sales of our Endoscopy products were $562 million in 2011, as compared to $541 million in 2010. Our international net sales were $625 million in 2011, as compared to $538 million in 2010, and included a $39 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Endoscopy net sales increased $69 million, or six percent, in 2011, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to higher net sales within our stent franchise, driven by our WallFlex family of stents; in particular, the WallFlex Biliary line, including the WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered Stent, which obtained CE Mark for treatment of benign biliary strictures in the fourth quarter of 2010. Increases in our biliary device sales were also supported by growth in our Advanix Biliary Plastic Stent System and the Expect Endoscopic Ultrasound Aspiration Needle, which we launched in the U.S. and certain international markets in the second quarter of 2011. Our hemostasis franchise sales also grew based on continued adoption and utilization of our Resolution Clip Device, an endoscopic mechanical clip designed to treat gastrointestinal bleeding.As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including endoscopic pulmonary intervention. In October 2010, we completed our acquisition of Asthmatx, Inc. Asthmatx designs, manufactures and markets a less invasive, catheter based bronchial thermoplasty procedure for the treatment of severe persistent asthma. The Alair Bronchial Thermoplasty System, developed by Asthmatx, has both CE Mark and FDA approval and is the first device based asthma treatment approved by the FDA. We expect this technology to strengthen our existing offering of pulmonary devices and contribute to mid to long term sales growth and diversification of the Endoscopy business.Peripheral Interventions (PI)Our PI product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and vena cava filters, which are 39Table of Contentsused to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $731 million in 2011, as compared to $669 million in 2010, an increase of $62 million, or nine percent. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $310 million in 2011 and 2010. Our international net sales were $421 million in 2011, as compared to $359 million in 2010, and included a $26 million favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide PI net sales increased $36 million, or five percent in 2011, as compared to 2010, driven by growth in all three of our peripheral interventions product franchises. Growth in our PI stent systems was driven by the EPIC self expanding nitinol stent system in certain international markets and the Carotid WALLSTENT stent system in Japan. We currently expect to launch the EPIC stent system in the U.S. during 2012. Our Core PI franchise experienced market share growth in 2011 driven primarily by the recent launches of our next generation Mustang percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon, our Coyote balloon catheter, a highly deliverable and ultra low profile balloon dilatation catheter designed for a wide range of peripheral angioplasty procedures, and our Charger PTA Balloon Catheter, launched in the U.S. in December 2011. In addition, our interventional oncology franchise continued strong worldwide sales growth, as recently launched products, including the Renegade HI FLO Fathom microcatheter and guidewire system and Interlock 35 Fibered IDC Occlusion System for peripheral embolization, continue to be well received by our customers. We expect to have a number of new PI products launching throughout 2012 that we believe will drive future growth in this business.As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states. In February 2011, we announced the acquisitions of S.I. Therapies and ReVascular Therapeutics, Inc., which add to our PI portfolio a re entry catheter and intraluminal chronic total occlusion (CTO) crossing device, enabling endovascular treatment in cases that typically cannot be treated with standard endovascular devices. We have commenced a limited market release of our OFFROAD re entry catheter system in certain international markets, and in February 2012, we launched our TRUEPATH intraluminal CTO device in the U.S. We expect to launch our TRUEPATH device in EMEA during the first half of 2012, and to expand the launch of our OFFROAD system in our international markets throughout 2012. We believe that offering these devices will enhance our position in assisting physicians in addressing the challenges of treating complex peripheral lesions.Urology/Womens HealthOur Urology/Womens Health division develops, manufactures and sells devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $498 million in 2011, as compared to $481 million in 2010, an increase of $17 million, or four percent. Our U.S. net sales were $362 million in 2011, as compared to $365 million in 2010. Our international net sales were $136 million in 2011, as compared to $116 million in 2010, and included an $8 million favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, worldwide net sales of our Urology/Womens Health products increased $9 million in 2011, as compared to 2010.Our Urology business experienced positive growth in 2011 due to the strength of our U.S. Core Stone Management business. The 2010 launch of our Accumax and Flexiva Laser Fibers drove the net sales growth in our U.S. Core Stone business. Additionally, our Stone business experienced double digit net sales growth in our Inter Continental region in 2011, as compared to 2010.Our Womens Health business was negatively impacted in 2011 by elective procedural softness and competitive product offerings. In addition, in July 2011, the FDA released a Public Health Notice update regarding complications related to the use of urogynecologic surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. Partially offsetting these negative impacts were increased market share and sales of our Genesys Hydro ThermAblator (HTA) system, a next generation endometrial ablation system designed to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in premenopausal women with menorrhagia. The Genesys HTA System features a smaller and lighter console, simplified set up requirements, and an enhanced graphic user interface and is designed to improve operating performance.NeuromodulationOur worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $336 million in 2011, as compared to $304 million in 2010, an increase of $32 million, or 11 percent. Our U.S. net sales of Neuromodulation products were $317 million in 2011, as compared to $288 million in 2010, and our international net sales of these products were $19 million in 2011, as compared to $16 million in 2010, and included a $1 million favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in U.S. net sales was due primarily to higher procedural volumes and positive momentum from recent product launches, partially offset by the impact of competitive launches. Within our Neuromodulation business, we market the Precision Plus Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) system, the worlds first rechargeable SCS device for chronic pain management. In addition, in the second quarter of 2011, we received CE Mark approval and launched our Clik Anchor for our Precision Plus SCS System. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we received FDA approval for and launched the Infinion 16 Percutaneous Lead, the worlds first and only 16 contact percutaneous lead. We also market the Linear 3 4 and Linear 3 6 Percutaneous Leads for use with our SCS systems, which are designed to provide physicians more treatment options for their chronic pain patients. We believe that we continue to have a 40Table of Contentstechnology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as Multiple Independent Current Control, which is intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely, and the broadest range of percutaneous lead configurations in the industry. We are looking to strengthen the clinical evidence with spinal cord stimulation and are committed to studies designed to demonstrate cost effectiveness or demonstrate the value of proprietary features in our SCS system. We expect to complete our VANTAGE Study, a European clinical trial for the treatment of Parkinsons Disease using our Vercise Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System in 2013. We believe we have an exciting opportunity in DBS with our ability to customize the field designed to precisely stimulate the target without extraneous stimulation of adjacent areas that may cause unwanted side effects. In addition, in January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Intelect Medical, Inc., a development stage company developing advanced visualization and programming for the Vercise system. We believe this acquisition leverages the core architecture of our Vercise platform and will advance our technology in the field of deep brain stimulation.ElectrophysiologyWe develop less invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance, responsiveness and durability. Our Blazer line includes our next generation Blazer Prime ablation catheter, and our Blazer Open Irrigated Catheter, launched in select European countries, our latest radiofrequency ablation catheter designed to treat a variety of arrhythmias. Worldwide net sales of our Electrophysiology products were $147 million in 2011 and 2010. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $107 million in 2011, as compared to $112 million in 2010. Our international net sales of these products were $40 million in 2011, as compared to $35 million in 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed $3 million to our worldwide Electrophysiology net sales, as compared to the prior year, worldwide Electrophysiology net sales decreased $3 million, or two percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010.Emerging MarketsAs part of our POWER strategy, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence. In particular, we are focusing our efforts and increasing our investment in certain countries whose economies and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly, in order to maximize opportunities in those countries. We significantly increased sales in China, Brazil and India and continued investments in infrastructure in those countries in 2011. As a result of these efforts, during 2011, we experienced double digit sales growth in these markets, as compared to 2010. We recently created a new Asia Pacific regional organization under new leadership to further increase our capabilities and strengthen our position in the worlds fastest growing region. We are planning to invest $150 million over a five year period in order to expand our commercial presence in China, one of the worlds largest and fastest growing medical device markets. We expect to build a local manufacturing operation focused on serving Chinese market needs, as well as develop a world class training center for healthcare providers. In addition, we expect to further invest in local research and development and clinical studies in emerging markets.Neurovascular DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, and will receive an additional $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will occur during 2013. We are providing transitional services through a transition services agreement, and are also manufacturing and supplying products to Stryker. These transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective through the end of 2012, subject to extension. We recorded revenue of $141 million during 2011 related to this divested business as compared to $344 million of sales of Neurovascular and other divested product lines in 2010. Our sales related to divested businesses will continue to decline as the various transition services and supply agreements terminate. See Results of Operations and Note C Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale for additional information.Restructuring InitiativesOn an on going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, and better alignment of expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that are essential to our long term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long term success. These initiatives are described below, and additional information can be found in Results of Operations and Note H Restructuring related Activities to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.41Table of Contents2011 Restructuring planOn July 26, 2011, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a restructuring initiative (the 2011 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. We estimate that the execution of the plan will reduce annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million exiting 2013, a portion of which will be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth, including priority growth and emerging markets initiatives. Key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; leveraging preferred vendors; and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency. Among these efforts, we are expanding our ability to deliver best in class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets. This action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost reducing and productivity enhancing opportunities. In addition, we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. Activities under the 2011 Restructuring plan were initiated in the third quarter of 2011 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2013.2010 Restructuring planOn February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the re alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre tax operating expenses of approximately $200 million to $250 million, once completed in 2012. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012.Plant Network OptimizationIn January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. We estimate that the program will result in annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the estimated $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our completed 2007 Restructuring plan. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012.Healthcare ReformThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. Certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood; therefore, it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law. The legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. U.S. net sales represented approximately 50 percent of our worldwide net sales in 2011 and, therefore, this tax burden may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Other provisions of this law, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases. Any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally. Results of OperationsNet SalesAs of December 31, 2011, we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions: the United States; EMEA, consisting 42Table of Contentsof Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Japan; and Inter Continental, consisting of our Asia Pacific and the Americas operating segments, which include the emerging markets of Brazil, China and India. The reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment. We manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard currency exchange rates. The regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note O Segment Reporting to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report.The following tables provide our worldwide net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. We have restated regional net sales for 2009 and 2010 to exclude sales from our former Neurovascular business, which we sold to Stryker Corporation in January 2011, and present net sales from this business within divested businesses in the tables below. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of managements use of this non GAAP financial measure. 2011 versus 20102010 versus 2009 Year EndedDecember 31,As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasisAs ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201120102009United States$4,010$4,215$4,550(5)%(5)%(7)%(7)%EMEA1,7421,6831,7503%(1)%(4)%(1)%Japan9518869087%(2)%(2)%(9)%Inter Continental77867862115%9%9%1%International3,4713,2473,2797%1%(1)%(3)%Subtotal Core Businesses7,4817,4627,8290%(2)%(5)%(5)%Divested Businesses141344359N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide$7,622$7,806$8,188(2)%(5)%(5)%(5)%The following tables provide our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. 2011 versus 20102010 versus 2009 Year EndedDecember 31,As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasisAs ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201120102009Interventional Cardiology$2,495$2,602$2,859(4)%(7)%(9)%(10)%Cardiac Rhythm Management2,0872,1802,413(4)%(7)%(10)%(10)%Endoscopy1,1871,0791,00610%6%7%6%Peripheral Interventions7316696619%5%1%0%Urology/Womens Health4984814564%2%5%5%Neuromodulation33630428511%10%7%7%Electrophysiology1471471490%(2)%(2)%(2)%Subtotal Core Businesses7,4817,4627,8290%(2)%(5)%(5)%Divested Businesses141344359N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide$7,622$7,806$8,188(2)%(5)%(5)%(5)%The divisional constant currency growth rates in the tables above can be recalculated from the reconciliations provided below.

The decrease was driven primarily by lower U.S. CRM net sales of $129 million resulting from the contraction in the U.S. ICD market in 2011, as well as lower U.S. Interventional Cardiology net sales of $119 million driven by competitive and other pricing pressures and reductions in procedural volumes across our key markets. Partially offsetting these decreases, our Endoscopy business increased U.S. net sales $21 million, as compared to 2010, due primarily to continued commercialization and adoption of products within our stent franchise, and our Neuromodulation division increased U.S. net sales $29 million, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher procedural volumes and positive momentum from new product launches. Refer to Business and Market Overview for further discussion of our net sales.During 2010, our U.S. net sales decreased $335 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by lower U.S. CRM net sales of $237 million, due primarily to the U.S. CRM 2010 ship hold and product removal actions impacting our ICD and CRT D systems during 2010 in the U.S. On March 15, 2010, we announced a ship hold and removal of our field inventory related to our ICD and CRT D systems in the U.S. after determining that certain instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the FDA. During the second quarter of 2010, we submitted the required documentation and received clearance from the FDA for these manufacturing changes and resumed distribution of our ICD and CRT D systems. The reduction in our U.S. CRM net sales was due to lost sales of approximately $120 million during the ship hold, and a reduction of market share following the ship hold. We estimate our U.S. defibrillator market share decreased 300 basis points exiting 2010, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to these product actions. Our U.S. net sales were also negatively impacted by a decline in U.S. coronary stent system net sales of $119 million, due primarily to a decline in our share of the U.S. drug eluting stent market as well as lower average selling prices. In addition, U.S. net sales of our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) business decreased $15 million in 2010, as compared to 2009. These decreases were partially offset by increases of U.S. net sales in 2010 from our Endoscopy business of $24 million, $12 million attributable to our Urology/Womens Health business, and $17 million of growth in our Neuromodulation business, as compared to 2009.International Net SalesDuring 2011, our international net sales increased $224 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed $201 million to our international net sales in 2011 as compared to 2010. Contributing to the year over year growth in international net sales, were constant currency increases from our Endoscopy business, primarily due to the strength of our WallFlex line of stents, and our Peripheral Interventions business, driven by growth in all three of our PI product franchises. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net sales in our Inter Continental region increased $61 million, or nine percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010, primarily as a result of strong growth in China, Brazil and India as we begin to see a return on our commercial investment in these areas. Net sales in our EMEA region decreased $17 million, or one percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, driven primarily by a decline in CRM net sales. Our net sales in Japan decreased $21 million, or two percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due primarily to a decline in Interventional Cardiology net sales. Refer to Business and Market Overview for further discussion of our net sales.During 2010, our international net sales decreased $32 million, or one percent, as compared to 2009. Foreign currency fluctuations 44Table of Contentscontributed approximately $60 million to our international net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales in our EMEA region decreased $16 million, or one percent, in 2010, as compared the prior year. Our net sales in Japan decreased $81 million, or nine percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to competitive launches of drug eluting stent system technology and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain drug eluting stent system customers, as well as reductions in average selling prices. Net sales in our Inter Continental region, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $6 million, or one percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year.Gross ProfitOur gross profit was $4.963 billion in 2011, $5.207 billion in 2010, and $5.612 billion in 2009. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit decreased to 65.1 percent in 2011, as compared to 66.7 percent in 2010 and 68.5 percent in 2009. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year EndedDecember 31, 20112010Gross profit prior year66.7 %68.5 %PROMUS supply true up0.6 % Drug eluting stent system sales mix and pricing0.2 %(1.7)%Impact of CRM ship hold (0.4)%Neurovascular divestiture(1.4)% Transition related inventory charges(0.7)% All other, including period expenses, other inventory charges and net impact of foreign currency(0.3)%0.3 %Gross profit current year65.1 %66.7 %The primary factor contributing to the decrease in our gross profit margin during 2011, as compared to 2010, was the negative impact of lower sales of Neurovascular products and at significantly lower gross profit margins as result of the divestiture of our Neurovascular business in January 2011 and the terms of transitional supply agreements with Stryker. In addition, we recognized transition related inventory charges of $54 million in 2011, primarily related to PROMUS excess inventory and purchase commitments as a result of our fourth quarter 2011 launch of our internally developed and self manufactured next generation PROMUS Element stent system in the U.S. The decreases in 2011 were partially offset by the positive impact of a $50 million credit to cost of products sold recognized in the first quarter of 2011, related to a two year retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our PROMUS supply arrangement with Abbott for historical purchases of PROMUS stent systems. Our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted in the future as a result of this adjustment process. Declines in average selling prices of our products, particularly our drug eluting stent systems, were offset by the positive impact of product mix related to sales of our drug eluting stent systems, as we shifted sales to our internally developed and manufactured stent systems with more favorable gross profit margins during 2011, as well as the positive impact of cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. In addition, our gross profit margin in 2010 was negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. CRM business.The primary factor contributing to the reduction in our gross profit margin during 2010, as compared to 2009, was a decrease in sales of our higher margin TAXUS drug eluting stent systems and an increasing shift towards the PROMUS stent system during 2010, as well as declines in the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems. Sales of the PROMUS stent system represented approximately 52 percent of our worldwide drug eluting stent system sales in 2010, as compared to 40 percent in 2009. As a result of the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit margin of a PROMUS stent system, supplied to us by Abbott, is significantly lower than our internally developed and manufactured TAXUS stent system and PROMUS Element everolimus eluting stent system. Our gross profit margin in 2010 was also negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. CRM business.Operating ExpensesThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses:45Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 % of Net % of Net % of Net(in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ SalesSelling, general and administrative expenses 2,487 32.6 2,580 33.1 2,635 32.2Research and development expenses 895 11.7 939 12.0 1,035 12.6Royalty expense 172 2.3 185 2.4 191 2.3Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpensesIn 2011, our SG&A expenses decreased $93 million, or four percent, as compared to 2010, and were 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. Our SG&A expenses were lower in 2011, as compared to 2010, as a result of the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker in January 2011 and lower expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and cost containment discipline. In addition, our SG&A expenses for 2011 benefited from the reversal of $20 million of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against long outstanding receivables in Greece in 2011. These receivables had previously been fully reserved as we had determined that they had a high risk of being uncollectible due to the economic situation in Greece. During the first quarter of 2011, the Greek government converted these receivables into bonds, which we were able to monetize, reducing our allowance for doubtful accounts as a credit to SG&A expense. We continue to monitor the European economic environment for any collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables in this region. These decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as additional SG&A expenses related to our recent acquisitions and global expansion initiatives.In 2010, our SG&A expenses decreased $55 million, or two percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was related primarily to savings from our restructuring initiatives driven by lower head count and lower consulting and travel spending, as compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an $11 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations. As a percentage of net sales, our SG&A expenses were slightly higher than 2009 due to the impact of maintaining compensation levels for our U.S. CRM sales force, despite the reduction in net sales of our CRM products in the U.S.Research and Development (R&D) ExpensesIn 2011, our R&D expenses decreased $44 million, or five percent, as compared to 2010, and were 30 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease in 2011 was due to the elimination of spending related to our Neurovascular business, cost reductions associated with our restructuring programs and the beginning benefits of our initiatives to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient; partially offset by increased R&D funding for our acquisitions and certain other priority growth initiatives. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.In 2010, our R&D expenses decreased $96 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was due to the on going re prioritization of R&D projects and the re allocation of spending as part of our efforts to focus on products with higher returns, as well as the delay of certain of our clinical trials.Royalty ExpenseIn 2011, our royalty expense decreased $13 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2010, and was slightly lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to royalty expense attributable to Neurovascular products which was eliminated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. These royalties represented $12 million of expense in 2010.In 2010, our royalty expense decreased $6 million, or three percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was due primarily to lower sales of our drug eluting coronary stent systems, partially offset by the continued shift in the mix of our drug eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS and PROMUS Element stent systems. The royalty rate applied to sales of these stent systems is, on average, higher than that associated with sales of our TAXUS stent systems.Loss on Program TerminationIn the second quarter of 2009, we discontinued one of our internal R&D programs in order to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result, we recorded a pre tax loss of $16 million, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, associated with future payments 46Table of Contentsthat we believe we remain contractually obligated to make. We do not believe that the cancellation of this program will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash flows.Amortization ExpenseOur amortization expense was $421 million in 2011, as compared to $513 million in 2010 a decrease of $92 million or 18 percent. This decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011. This non cash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Amortization expense was $513 million in 2010, as compared to $511 million in 2009, an increase of $2 million, or less than one percent.Goodwill Impairment Charges2011 ChargeWe test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. Based on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011, we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. ICD market, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. CRM business unit. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies and recorded a non deductible goodwill impairment charge of $697 million, on both a pre tax and after tax basis, associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011.We used the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit. We updated all aspects of the DCF model associated with the U.S. CRM business, including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rate and the appropriate market participant risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to apply.As a result of physician reaction to study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association regarding evidence based guidelines for ICD implants and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigations into hospitals ICD implant practices and the expansion of Medicare recovery audits, among other factors, we estimated the U.S. CRM market would experience negative growth rates in 2011, as compared to 2010. Due to these estimated near term market reductions, as well as the economic impact of physician alignment to hospitals, recent demographic information released by the American Heart Association indicating a lower prevalence of heart failure, and increased competitive and other pricing pressures, we lowered our estimated average U.S. CRM net sales growth rates within our 15 year DCF model from the mid single digits to the low single digits. Partially offsetting these factors are increased levels of profitability as a result of cost reduction initiatives and process efficiencies within the U.S. CRM business. The impact of the reduction in the size of the U.S. ICD market, and the related reduction in our forecasted 2011 U.S. CRM net sales, as well as the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter as a result of the trends noted above were the key factors contributing to the first quarter 2011 goodwill impairment charge.In the second quarter of 2011, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of our U.S. CRM reporting unit. Based on the remaining book value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of 2011, the carrying value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit exceeded its fair value, due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit. The remaining book value of our U.S. CRM amortizable intangible assets was approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other and our accounting policies, we tested our U.S. CRM amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis as of March 31, 2011, in conjunction with the goodwill impairment charge, and determined that these assets were not impaired. The assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test performed during the second quarter of 2011 related to our U.S. CRM reporting unit were substantially consistent with those used in our first quarter interim impairment test; therefore, it was not deemed necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test.We continue to identify four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM reporting unit, which holds $780 million of allocated goodwill; our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit, which holds $2.4 billion of allocated goodwill; our U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit, which holds $1.3 billion of allocated goodwill; and our EMEA region, which holds $4.0 billion of allocated goodwill, each as of December 31, 2011. As of the most recent annual assessment as of April 1, the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. 47Table of ContentsCRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) ranged from approximately eight percent to 15 percent. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates, levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC rate applied. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. For each of these reporting units, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions, including increases to the reporting unit carrying value, may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a 50 basis point increase in the WACC applied to the reporting units, excluding acquisitions, would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM reporting unit, and a 100 basis point increase would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. Neuromodulation, U.S. Cardiovascular and EMEA reporting units. In addition, keeping all other variables constant, a 100 basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM reporting unit, and a 200 basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. Neuromodulation and EMEA reporting units. During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, we closely monitored these key variables and other factors and determined that we were not required to perform an interim impairment test. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in the business performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill balance. Future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to:decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater than expected declines in procedural volumes, pricing pressures, product actions, and or disruptive technology developments;declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new products, and market and or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls;the impacts of the European sovereign debt crisis, including greater than expected declines in pricing, reductions in procedural volumes, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or an inability to collect or factor our EMEA accounts receivable;decreases in our profitability due to an inability to successfully implement and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations, increases in our market participant tax rate, and or changes in tax laws;negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products;the level of success of on going and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions, and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products;the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies, achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations, and establishing government and third party payer reimbursement, and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully;declines in revenue as a result of loss of key members of our sales force and other key personnel;increases in our market participant risk adjusted WACC; andchanges in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses.Negative changes in one or more of these factors could result in additional impairment charges.2010 ChargeThe ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. ICD and CRT D products, which we announced on March 15, 2010, and the forecasted corresponding financial impact on our operations created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. CRM reporting unit during the first quarter of 2010. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies and recorded an estimated non deductible goodwill impairment charge of $1.817 billion, on both a pre tax and after tax basis, associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit.At the time we performed our 2010 interim goodwill impairment test, we estimated that our U.S. defibrillator market share would decrease approximately 400 basis points exiting 2010 as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions, as compared to our 48Table of Contentsmarket share exiting 2009, and that these actions would negatively impact our 2010 U.S. CRM revenues by approximately $300 million. In addition, we expected that our on going U.S. CRM net sales and profitability would likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions. Therefore, as a result of these product actions, as well as lower expectations of market growth in new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures, we lowered our estimated average U.S. CRM net sales growth rates within our 15 year DCF model, as well as our terminal value growth rate, by approximately a couple of hundred basis points to derive the fair value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit. The reduction in our forecasted 2010 U.S. CRM net sales, the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device manufacturers were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Partially offsetting these factors was a 50 basis point reduction in our estimated market participant risk adjusted WACC used in determining our discount rate.Goodwill impairment charges do not impact our debt covenants or our cash flows, and are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Intangible Asset Impairment Charges2011 ChargesDuring the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a $9 million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies. During the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a $12 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the timing and amount of expected cash flows related to certain purchased research and development projects. We do not believe that these impairments, or the factors causing these impairments, will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows.2010 ChargesDuring the first quarter of 2010, due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our Peripheral Interventions technology offerings, as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this technology, we lowered our sales forecasts associated with the product. In addition, during the third quarter of 2010, as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio, we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result of these factors, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies, we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded a $60 million charge in the first quarter of 2010, and a $5 million charge in the third quarter of 2010 to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value. We do not believe that these impairments, or the factors causing these impairments, will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows. 2009 ChargesIn 2009, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $12 million, associated primarily with lower than anticipated market penetration of one of our Urology technology offerings. We do not believe that these impairments will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows.These non cash charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Contingent Consideration ExpenseIn connection with certain of our acquisitions completed after our adoption of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, in 2009, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue , regulatory and commercialization based milestones. As of the respective acquisition dates, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired businesses. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, we re measure these liabilities each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from accretion of the liability due to the passage of time, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or changes in the expected probability and timing of achieving regulatory or commercialization milestones, changes in discount rates, and payments. We recorded net expense of $7 million during 2011 and expense of $2 million during 2010, representing the change in the estimated fair value of these obligations. The expense recorded during 2011 included a $20 million benefit related to the reduction in the fair value of a payment liability due to a revised estimate of the probability of achieving a future research and development milestone before a specified time period. We do not believe that this revised timing, or the factors causing the fair value adjustment of this contingent liability, will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows.These acquisition related charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.49Table of ContentsAcquisition related MilestoneIn connection with Abbott Laboratories 2006 acquisition of Guidants vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott agreed to pay us a milestone payment of $250 million upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to market the XIENCE V stent system in Japan. The MHLW approved the XIENCE V stent system in the first quarter of 2010 and we received the milestone payment from Abbott, which we recorded as a $250 million pre tax gain. This non recurring acquisition related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Purchased Research and DevelopmentDuring 2009, we recorded purchased research and development charges of $21 million, associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements, in accordance with our accounting policies and U.S. GAAP. Since the technology purchases did not involve the transfer of processes or outputs as defined by ASC Topic 805, the transactions did not qualify as business combinations. See Note A Significant Accounting Policies to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our accounting for purchased research and development.Restructuring Charges and Restructuring related Activities2011 Restructuring planOn July 26, 2011, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a restructuring initiative (the 2011 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. We estimate that the execution of the plan will reduce annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million exiting 2013, a portion of which will be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth, including priority growth and emerging markets initiatives. Key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; leveraging preferred vendors; and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency. Among these efforts, we are expanding our ability to deliver best in class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets. This action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost reducing and productivity enhancing opportunities. In addition, we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. Activities under the 2011 Restructuring plan were initiated in the third quarter of 2011 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013.We estimate that the 2011 Restructuring plan will result in total pre tax charges of approximately $155 million to $210 million, and that approximately $150 million to $200 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $13 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $35 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations.The following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost:Type of costTotal estimated amount expected tobe incurredRestructuring charges: Termination benefits$125 million to $150 millionOther (1)$20 million to $40 millionRestructuring related expenses: Other (2)$10 million to $20 million $155 million to $210 million(1)Includes primarily consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.(2)Comprised of other costs directly related to the 2011 Restructuring plan, including program management, accelerated depreciation, retention and infrastructure related costs.2010 Restructuring planOn February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring 50Table of Contentsinitiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the re alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the re prioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre tax operating expenses of approximately $200 million to $250 million, once completed. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support our businesses. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012.We estimate that the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in total pre tax charges of approximately $165 million to $185 million, and that approximately $150 million to $160 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $140 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $159 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost:Type of costTotal estimated amount expected tobe incurredRestructuring charges: Termination benefits$95 million to $100 millionFixed asset write offs$10 million to $15 millionOther (1)$50 million to $55 millionRestructuring related expenses: Other (2)$10 million to $15 million $165 million to $185 million(1)Includes primarily consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.(2)Comprised of other costs directly related to the 2010 Restructuring plan, including accelerated depreciation and infrastructure related costs.Plant Network Optimization programIn January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, discussed below, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. We estimate that the program will result in annualized run rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs expected from activities under our completed 2007 Restructuring plan. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012.We expect that the execution of the Plant Network Optimization program will result in total pre tax charges of approximately $130 million to $145 million, and that approximately $110 million to $120 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $70 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $124 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through cost of products sold within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of our estimates of costs associated with the Plant Network Optimization program by major type of cost:51Table of ContentsType of costTotal estimated amount expected tobe incurredRestructuring charges: Termination benefits$35 million to $40 million Restructuring related expenses: Accelerated depreciation$20 million to $25 millionTransfer costs (1)$75 million to $80 million $130 million to $145 million(1)Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines among facilities, including costs of transfer teams, freight, idle facility and product line validations.2007 Restructuring planIn October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan). The plan was intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short and long term shareholder value. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and SG&A expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008. We have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases, primarily in customer facing positions. In addition, we expect reductions of manufacturing costs by an annualized run rate of approximately $35 million as a result of transfers of certain production lines. Due to the longer term nature of the manufacturing related initiatives, we do not expect to achieve the full benefit of these reductions in manufacturing costs until 2012. The execution of this plan is now completed and resulted in total pre tax expenses of $427 million and required cash outlays of $380 million, of which we have paid $374 million to date.We recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plans of $89 million during 2011, $116 million during 2010, and $63 million during 2009. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $40 million during 2011, $53 million during 2010, and $67 million during 2009. The following presents these costs by major type and line item within our 2011 consolidated statements of operations included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, as well as by program:Year Ended December 31, 2011 (in millions)TerminationBenefits RetentionIncentives AcceleratedDepreciation TransferCosts Fixed AssetWrite offs Other TotalRestructuring charges$55 $34 $89Restructuring related expenses: Cost of products sold $9 $27 36Selling, general and administrative expenses 4 4 9 27 4 40 $55 $9 $27 $38 $129 (in millions)TerminationBenefits RetentionIncentives AcceleratedDepreciation TransferCosts Fixed AssetWrite offs Other Total2011 Restructuring plan$21 $14 $352010 Restructuring plan24 $1 24 49Plant Network Optimization program10 8 $27 45 $55 $9 $27 $38 $129 52Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31, 2010 (in millions)TerminationBenefits RetentionIncentives AcceleratedDepreciation TransferCosts Fixed AssetWrite offs Other TotalRestructuring charges$70 $11 $35 $116Restructuring related expenses: Cost of products sold $7 $41 48Selling, general and administrative expenses 5 5 7 41 5 53 $70 $7 $41 $11 $40 $169 (in millions)TerminationBenefits RetentionIncentives AcceleratedDepreciation TransferCosts Fixed AssetWrite offs Other Total2010 Restructuring plan$66 $11 $33 $110Plant Network Optimization program4 $7 $28 392007 Restructuring plan 13 7 20 $70 $7 $41 $11 $40 $169 Year Ended December 31, 2009 (in millions)TerminationBenefits RetentionIncentives AcceleratedDepreciation TransferCosts Fixed AssetWrite offs Other TotalRestructuring charges$34 $13 $16 $63Restructuring related expenses: Cost of products sold $5 $8 $37 50Selling, general and administrative expenses 10 3 1 14Research and development expenses 3 3 18 11 37 1 67 $34 $18 $11 $37 $13 $17 $130 (in millions)TerminationBenefits RetentionIncentives AcceleratedDepreciation TransferCosts Fixed AssetWrite offs Other TotalPlant Network Optimization program$22 $6 $12 $402007 Restructuring plan12 $18 5 25 $13 $17 90 $34 $18 $11 $37 $13 $17 $130 Termination benefits represent amounts incurred pursuant to our on going benefit arrangements and amounts for one time involuntary termination benefits, and have been recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 712, Compensation Non retirement Postemployment Benefits and ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. We expect to record additional termination benefits related to our restructuring initiatives in 2012 when we identify with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated. Other restructuring costs, which represent primarily consulting fees, are being recorded as incurred in accordance with ASC Topic 420. Accelerated depreciation is being recorded over the adjusted remaining useful life of the related assets, and production line transfer costs are being recorded as incurred. Retention incentives represent cash incentives, which were recorded over the service period during which eligible employees were required to remain employed with us in order to retain the payment.We have incurred cumulative restructuring charges related to our 2011 Restructuring plan, 2010 Restructuring plan and Plant Network Optimization program of $220 million and restructuring related costs of $98 million since we committed to each plan. 53Table of ContentsThe following presents these costs by major type and by plan: (in millions)2011Restructuringplan 2010Restructuringplan PlantNetworkOptimization TotalTermination benefits$21 $90 $36 $147Fixed asset write offs 11 11Other13 49 62Total restructuring charges34 150 36 220Accelerated depreciation 1 21 22Transfer costs 67 67Other1 8 9Restructuring related expenses1 9 88 98 $35 $159 $124 $318Restructuring and restructuring related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.We made cash payments of $114 million in 2011 associated with restructuring initiatives pursuant to these plans, and have made total cash payments of $223 million related to our 2011 Restructuring plan, 2010 Restructuring plan and Plant Network Optimization program since committing to each plan. Each of these payments was made using cash generated from operations, and are comprised of the following:(in millions)2011Restructuringplan 2010Restructuringplan PlantNetworkOptimization TotalYear Ended December 31, 2011 Termination benefits$3 $39 $3 $45Transfer costs 27 27Other10 32 42 $13 $71 $30 $114 Program to Date Termination benefits$3 $84 $3 $90Transfer costs 67 67Other10 56 66 $13 $140 $70 $223We also made cash payments of $4 million during 2011 associated with our 2007 Restructuring plan and have made total cash payments of $374 million related to the 2007 Restructuring plan since committing to the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007.Litigation related Charges and CreditsWe record certain significant litigation related activity as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized $48 million of litigation related charges. During 2010, we reached a settlement with Medinol Ltd., resolving the dispute we had with them that had been subject to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association. Under the terms of the settlement, we received proceeds of $104 million from Medinol, which we recorded as a pre tax gain in our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These charges and credits are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.In 2009, we recorded litigation related net charges of $2.022 billion, associated primarily with an agreement to settle three patent disputes with Johnson & Johnson for $1.725 billion, plus interest. In addition, in 2009, we reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which was formally accepted by the District Court in 2011, under which we paid $296 million 54Table of Contentsin January 2011 in order resolve the U.S. Government investigation of Guidant Corporation related to product advisories issued in 2005. We recorded a net charge of $294 million related to this matter in 2009, representing $296 million associated with the agreement, net of a $2 million reversal of a related accrual. Further, in 2009, we reduced previously recorded reserves associated with certain litigation related matters following certain favorable court rulings, resulting in a credit of $60 million and recorded a pre tax charge of $50 million associated with the settlement of all outstanding litigation with another party.Gain on DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, and we will receive an additional $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will occur during 2013. We recorded a pre tax gain of $778 million ($545 million after tax) during 2011 associated with the transaction. We also have recorded a deferred gain of approximately $30 million, included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which is being recognized upon the performance of certain activities under the transition services and supply agreements. This non recurring divestiture related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Interest ExpenseOur interest expense decreased to $281 million in 2011, as compared to $393 million in 2010. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to repayment of $1.250 billion of debt during 2011, as well as lower average borrowing rates. Our average borrowing rate was 5.4 percent in 2011 and 6.0 percent in 2010. In addition, our 2010 interest expense included $25 million of write offs of debt issuance costs, discounts, and the impacts of the early termination of interest rate derivative contracts associated with loan prepayments; whereas 2011 interest expense included $6 million associated with the write off of debt issuance costs, and a $3 million benefit associated with interest rate derivative contracts terminated during 2011. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note F Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations.Our interest expense decreased to $393 million in 2010, as compared to $407 million in 2009. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to term loan prepayments throughout 2009, as well as the 2010 prepayment of our $900 million loan from Abbott Laboratories and a slight decrease in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.0 percent in 2010 and 6.1 percent in 2009. In addition, our 2010 interest expense included $15 million of write offs of debt issuance costs and impacts of the early termination of interest rate derivative contracts, as compared to $34 million in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by the write off of the remaining $10 million discount attributable to the Abbott loan upon prepayment.Other, netOur other, net reflected income of $19 million in 2011, expense of $14 million in 2010, and expense of $7 million in 2009. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201120102009Interest income $7$13$7Foreign currency losses (12)(9)(5)Net gains (losses) on investments 27(12)3Other expense, net (3)(6)(12) $19$(14)$(7)During 2011, we recognized gains of $38 million associated with 2011 acquisitions in which we held prior equity interests. Partially offsetting these gains were net losses of $11 million in 2011 and net losses of $12 million in 2010, relating to the write down of investments in our portfolio. The acquisition related credit is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Tax RateThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate:55Table of Contents Year EndedDecember 31, 201120102009Reported tax rate 31.3 %0.2%(21.6)%Impact of certain receipts/charges* (12.0)%18.0%39.1 % 19.3 %18.2%17.5 %*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.The change in our reported tax rate for 2011, as compared to 2010, and 2009, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2011, these receipts and charges included a gain on our divestiture of the Neurovascular business, a non deductible goodwill impairment charge, other intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring , litigation and acquisition related charges and credits. Our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items, related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, changes in various state tax laws, the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions, and the finalization of our 2010 U.S. Federal tax return. In 2010, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisition related milestone payment, and restructuring related charges. In 2010, our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items, related primarily to the re measurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third party case and the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third party case. In 2009, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, purchased research and development charges, restructuring and litigation related net charges, a favorable tax ruling on a divestiture related gain recognized in a prior period, and discrete tax items associated primarily with resolutions of uncertain tax positions related to audit settlements and changes in estimates for tax benefits claimed related to prior periods.We have received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. Subsequent to issuing these Notices, the IRS conceded a portion of its original assessment. The total incremental tax liability now asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidants vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment and we believe that the IRS has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated third party agreement with Abbott. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed, or will timely file, petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the tax years in challenge. No payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2011, we had $267 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $78 million invested in money market and government funds, $88 million invested in short term time deposits, and $101 million in interest bearing and non interest bearing bank accounts. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal, and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and $350 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, both described below.The following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:56Table of Contents Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201120102009Cash provided by operating activities $1,008$325$835Cash provided by (used for) investing activities 769(480)(793)Cash used for financing activities (1,721)(496)(820)Operating ActivitiesDuring 2011, we generated $1.008 billion from operating activities, as compared to $325 million in 2010, an increase of $683 million. This increase was driven primarily by lower litigation related payments of approximately $1.3 billion. Our 2011 litigation related payments primarily consisted of a payment of $296 million to the DOJ; during 2010, we made payments of $1.725 billion to Johnson & Johnson related to a patent litigation settlement and received $104 million in connection with a litigation settlement with Medinol. Our cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also included proceeds of approximately $80 million related to the termination of our outstanding interest rate derivative contracts and the receipt of a $75 million manufacturing cost true up payment from Abbott in accordance with our supply agreement. Partially offsetting these items was lower operating profit in 2011 and higher tax related net cash outflows of approximately $400 million during 2011, primarily due to federal tax refunds received in 2010. In addition, our 2010 cash flows include the receipt of a $250 million milestone payment from Abbott.Our 2010 operating cash flows were $510 million lower than our 2009 operating cash flows. This was primarily due to net legal payments of approximately $1.621 billion in 2010, as compared to approximately $837 million of legal payments in 2009. This increase in cash outflows for legal payments was partially offset by the receipt of a $250 million milestone payment from Abbott in 2010.Investing ActivitiesDuring 2011, cash provided by investing activities was comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker. We received $1.440 billion of net cash proceeds during 2011 related to the sale of this business. We will also receive an additional $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will be completed during 2013. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments of $370 million for acquisitions consummated during 2011; and capital expenditures, net of proceeds on sales of fixed assets, of $288 million. Our capital expenditures in 2011 included investments to automate our distribution facilities and to enhance our manufacturing capabilities to support continued growth in our business units. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million during 2012.During 2010, our investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of $272 million, as well as payments of approximately $200 million to acquire Asthmatx, Inc. and certain other strategic assets.During 2009, our investing activities included $523 million of payments related to prior period acquisitions. Our investing activities in 2009 also included capital expenditures of $312 million, payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of businesses and certain technology rights of $54 million, which were offset by proceeds from the sale of investments in, and collection of notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and privately held companies, of $91 million.Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs, discussed in Note L Stockholders Equity to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.DebtWe made payments on debt, net of proceeds from borrowings, of $1.250 billion in 2011, $527 million in 2010, and $853 million in 2009. We had total debt of $4.261 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $5.438 billion as of December 31, 2010. During 2011, we prepaid the remaining $1.0 billion of our term loan and paid $250 million of our senior notes at maturity. The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2011 is as follows:57Table of Contents Payments due by Period (in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter TotalSenior notes $600 $1,250 $600 $1,750 4,200 $600 $1,250 $600 $1,750 $4,200Note:The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes.In July 2011, Fitch Ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to BBB , an investment grade rating; and in February 2012, Moodys Investors Service upgraded our corporate credit rating to Baa3, an investment grade rating. In addition, Standard & Poors Ratings Services has maintained an investment grade corporate credit rating for us since 2009. We believe these rating improvements reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows, the reduction of our debt, and our improved financial fundamentals. Term Loan and Revolving Credit FacilityDuring 2011, we prepaid the remaining $1.0 billion of our term loan maturities without premium or penalty.We maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, maturing in June 2013, with up to two one year extension options subject to certain conditions. Any revolving credit facility borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin of between 1.55 percent and 2.625 percent, based on our corporate credit ratings (2.05 percent, as of December 31, 2011). In addition, we are required to pay a facility fee based on our credit ratings and the total amount of revolving credit commitments, regardless of usage, under the agreement (0.45 percent, as of December 31, 2011). The Fitch upgrade resulted in a slightly favorable reduction in the facility fee and the interest rate on the facility during 2011. Any borrowings under the revolving credit facility are unrestricted and unsecured. There were no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010.Our revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows: Covenant Requirement Actual as ofDecember 31, 2011 Maximum leverage ratio (1)3.5 times 1.6 timesMinimum interest coverage ratio (2)3.0 times 9.4 times(1)Ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, as amended, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.(2)Ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, as amended, to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.The credit agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, through the credit agreement maturity, of up to $258 million in restructuring charges and restructuring related expenses related to our previously announced restructuring plans, plus an additional $300 million for any future restructuring initiatives, including our 2011 Restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2011, we had $341 million of the combined restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any litigation related charges and credits are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA until such items are paid or received; and up to $1.5 billion of any future cash payments for future litigation settlements or damage awards (net of any litigation payments received); as well as litigation related cash payments (net of cash receipts) of up to $1.310 billion related to amounts that were recorded in the financial statements as of March 31, 2010 are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1.813 billion of the combined legal payment exclusion remaining.As of and through December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Our inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers.Senior NotesWe had senior notes outstanding in the amount of $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $4.450 billion as of December 31, 2010. In January 2011, we paid $250 million of our senior notes at maturity.58Table of ContentsOther ArrangementsWe also maintain a $350 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. In August 2011, we extended the maturity of this facility to August 2012. There were no amounts borrowed under this facility as of December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010.We have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately 330 million Euro (translated to approximately $430 million as of December 31, 2011). We have no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de recognized $390 million of receivables as of December 31, 2011 at an average interest rate of 3.3 percent, and $363 million as of December 31, 2010 at an average interest rate of 2.0 percent. The European sovereign debt crisis may impact our future ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain Southern European countries. Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt. This could result in terminations of, or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs. Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding. Within Italy, Spain, and Portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has continued to increase. We believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to our Italy, Spain and Portugal accounts receivable; however, we will continue to monitor the European economic environment for any collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables. In addition, we are currently pursuing alternative factoring providers and financing arrangements to mitigate our credit exposure to receivables in this region. During the first quarter of 2011, the Greek government converted a significant portion of our outstanding receivables into bonds, which we monetized during the first quarter and reduced our credit exposure in this country.In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to 18.5 billion Japanese yen (translated to approximately $240 million as of December 31, 2011). We de recognized $188 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2011 at an average interest rate of 1.7 percent and $197 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2010 at an average interest rate of 1.7 percent. De recognized accounts and notes receivable are excluded from trade accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. EquityDuring 2011, we received $21 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $31 million in 2010, and $33 million in 2009. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.In May 2011, our Board of Directors and shareholders approved our 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2011 LTIP), authorizing the issuance of up to approximately 145 million shares of our common stock. The 2011 LTIP provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted common stock, deferred stock units, options to acquire our common stock, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other stock and non stock awards. In addition, in July 2011, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock and re approved approximately 37 million shares remaining under a previous share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes. During 2011, we repurchased 82 million shares of our common stock for approximately $492 million, pursuant to our share repurchase authorizations. As of December 31, 2011, we had $508 million remaining authorization under our 2011 share repurchase program and 37 million shares authorized under our previous share repurchase programs.Stock based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was $128 million in 2011, $150 million in 2010, and $144 million in 2009. Stock based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.We generally make equity awards on an annual basis during the month of February. Prior to mid 2010, we expensed stock based awards over the period between grant date and retirement eligibility, or immediately if the employee was retirement eligible at the date of grant. Therefore, during the first quarter of each year, stock based compensation expense has historically been significantly higher than other quarters. However, for awards granted after mid 2010, retirement eligible employees must now provide one year of service after the date of grant in order to retain the award, should they retire. Therefore, for awards granted after mid 2010 to employees who will become retirement eligible prior to vesting, we expense stock based awards over the greater of the period between grant date and retirement eligibility date or one year.59Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2011.

Purchase obligations relate primarily to non cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.230 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note J Income Taxes to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.Certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B Acquisitions to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2011.Legal MattersThe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician customers, particularly in interventional cardiology, have historically moved quickly to adopt new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions. In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies. Several third parties have asserted that certain of our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that other products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and or liquidity. In particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson & Johnson, and have recently received several favorable court rulings, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, particularly relating to drug eluting stent systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and or liquidity. In the normal course of business, product liability, securities and commercial claims are asserted against us. Similar claims may 60Table of Contentsbe asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. We are substantially self insured with respect to product liability claims and intellectual property infringement, and maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims. The absence of significant third party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation, and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and or liquidity. In addition, the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and or liquidity. We generally record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for general product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $299 million as of December 31, 2011 and $588 million as of December 31, 2010, and includes estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense. The decrease in our accrual is due primarily to the payment of $296 million to the DOJ in order resolve the U.S. government investigation of Guidant Corporation related to product advisories issued in 2005. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Note K Commitments and Contingencies to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). We describe these accounting polices in Note ASignificant Accounting Policies to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring managements judgment that we consider critical:Revenue RecognitionWe allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. We do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.Inventory ProvisionsWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant 61Table of Contentschange in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration LiabilitiesWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including purchased research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider managements best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, as discussed in Note A, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. In addition, we test our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets. To test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment, we calculate the fair value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment.Goodwill ValuationWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our April 1, 2011 annual impairment assessment, we identified six reporting units within the U.S., including our CRM, Neuromodulation, Endoscopy, Urology/Womens Health, Electrophysiology, and Cardiovascular (consisting of Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions) franchises, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment. In addition, we identified four international reporting units, including EMEA, Japan, Asia Pacific and the Americas. When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting units operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment. This approach calculates fair value 62Table of Contentsby estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market participant risk adjusted weighted average costs of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units future expected cash flows.If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated, we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test.Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.We continue to identify four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM reporting unit, which holds $780 million of allocated goodwill; our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit, which holds $2.4 billion of allocated goodwill; our U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit, which holds $1.3 billion of allocated goodwill; and our EMEA region, which holds $4.0 billion of allocated goodwill, each as of December 31, 2011. As of the most recent annual assessment as of April 1, the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. CRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) ranged from approximately eight percent to 15 percent. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates, levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC rate applied. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. For each of these reporting units, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions, including increases to the reporting unit carrying value, may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a 50 basis point increase in the WACC applied to the reporting units, excluding acquisitions, would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM reporting unit, and a 100 basis point increase would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. Neuromodulation, U.S. Cardiovascular and EMEA reporting units. In addition, keeping all other variables constant, a 100 basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM reporting unit, and a 200 basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. Neuromodulation and EMEA reporting units. During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, we closely monitored these key variables and other factors and determined that we were not required to perform an interim impairment test. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent managements best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in the business performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill balance. See Note D Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our 2011 and 2010 goodwill impairment charges, as well as a discussion of future events that could have a negative impact on the fair value of these reporting units.Income TaxesWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment 63Table of Contentsis required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of these matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results.We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years.New Accounting PronouncementsStandards ImplementedASC Update No. 2009 13In October 2009, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. Update No. 2009 13 provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. We adopted prospectively Update No. 2009 13 as of January 1, 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position for the year ended December 31, 2011.ASC Update No. 2010 20In July 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010 20, Receivables (Topic 310) Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. Update No. 2010 20 requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures about financing receivables, including trade accounts receivable, with respect to credit quality and credit losses, including a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses. We adopted Update No. 2010 20 for our year ended December 31, 2010, except for the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, for which we included relevant disclosures beginning in our first quarter ended March 31, 2011. Refer to Note A Significant Accounting Policies to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for disclosures surrounding concentrations of credit risk and our policies with respect to the monitoring of the credit quality of customer accounts. In addition, refer to Note I Supplemental Balance Sheet Information to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.ASC Update No. 2010 29In December 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010 29, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. Update No. 2010 29 clarifies paragraph 805 10 50 2(h) to require public entities that enter into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis to disclose pro forma information for such business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period, including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the acquisition date had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. We were required to adopt Update No. 2010 29 for material business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011. The acquisitions we completed in 2011 are not considered material on an individual or aggregate basis and, therefore, are not subject to the disclosure requirements of Update No. 2010 29.Standards to be ImplementedASC Update No. 2011 04In May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. Update No. 2011 04 clarifies the FASBs intent about the application of certain existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and changes certain principles or requirements for measuring or disclosing information about fair value. We are required to adopt Update No. 2011 04 for our first quarter ending March 31, 2012 and do not believe its adoption will have a significant impact on our future results of operations or financial position.ASC Update No. 2011 05In May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 820): Presentation of Comprehensive 64Table of ContentsIncome. Update No. 2011 05 requires that net income, items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income be presented in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The amendments in this Update also require that reclassifications from other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements. We are required to adopt Update No. 2011 05 for our first quarter ending March 31, 2012, with the exception of the presentation of reclassifications on the face of the financial statements, which has been deferred by the FASB under ASC Update No. 2011 12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 820): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Our adoption of Update No. 2011 05 will not impact our future results of operations or financial position.ASC Update No. 2011 08In September 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. Update No. 2011 08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is "more likely than not" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. The "more likely than not" threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. We are required to adopt Update No. 2011 08 for our first quarter ending March 31, 2012 and do not believe its adoption will have a significant impact on our future results of operations or financial position.Additional InformationUse of Non GAAP Financial Measures Used by Boston ScientificTo supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income per share. To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non GAAP financial measure is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management uses these supplemental non GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments measures of profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non GAAP financial measures, as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per ShareGoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges These amounts represent non cash net write downs of our goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management business, as well as certain intangible asset balances. We remove the impact of these charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, these charges are excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and are 65Table of Contentsalso excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation. Accordingly, we have excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.Acquisition related (credits) charges These adjustments consist of (a) acquisition related gains on previously held equity interests, (b) contingent consideration fair value adjustments, (c) a gain on an acquisition related milestone receipt, (d) due diligence, other fees and exit costs, and (e) an inventory step up adjustment. The acquisition related gains on previously held equity interests is a non recurring benefit associated with acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments are non cash charges representing accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. The gain on an acquisition related milestone resulted from a 2010 receipt related to Guidant Corporations sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott Laboratories, and is not indicative of future operating results. Due diligence, other fees and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior acquisitions that are not representative of on going operations. The inventory step up adjustment is a non cash charge related to acquired inventory directly attributable to prior acquisitions and is not indicative of our on going operations, or on going cost of products sold. Accordingly, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Divestiture related (credits) charges These amounts represent (a) gains resulting from business divestitures and (b) fees and separation costs associated with business divestitures. We completed the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011 and the resulting gain is not indicative of future operating performance and is not used by management to assess operating performance. Fees and separation costs represent those associated with the divestiture of our Neurovascular business and are not representative of on going operations. Accordingly, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Restructuring and restructuring related costs These adjustments represent primarily severance, costs to transfer production lines from one facility to another, and other direct costs associated with our 2011 Restructuring plan, 2010 Restructuring plan, Plant Network Optimization program and 2007 Restructuring plan. These expenses are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, we excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Litigation related charges (credits) These amounts are primarily attributable to certain significant legal and product liability charges and gains. These charges and gains are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Discrete tax items These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition , divestiture , restructuring or litigation related charges (credits). These adjustments do not reflect expected on going operating results. Accordingly, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Amortization expense Amortization expense is a non cash charge and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our credit facility agreement. We remove the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from managements assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation. Accordingly, we have excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.Regional and Divisional Revenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange RatesChanges in foreign currency exchange rates The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, we excluded the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating 66Table of Contentsperformance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non GAAP financial measures differently than Boston Scientific does, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.Rule 10b5 1 Trading PlansPeriodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5 1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5 1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula(s) for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including the exercise and sale of stock options, and is entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non public information about the company.On May 27, 2011, Joseph M. Fitzgerald, our Senior Vice President and President, CRM, entered into a Rule 10b5 1 Trading Plan. Mr. Fitzgeralds plan covers the sale of 25,500 shares of our common stock to be acquired upon the exercise of (i) stock options for 15,000 shares expiring on July 17, 2011, (ii) stock options for 2,500 shares expiring on December 17, 2011 and (iii) stock options for 8,000 shares expiring on December 9, 2012. Transactions under Mr. Fitzgeralds plan are based upon pre established dates and stock price thresholds and will expire once all of the shares have been sold or December 7, 2012, whichever is earlier. Any transaction under Mr. Fitzgeralds plan will be disclosed publicly through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 67Table of ContentsManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ William H. Kucheman /s/ Jeffrey D. Capello William H. Kucheman Jeffrey D. Capello Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and ChiefFinancial Officer 68Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited Boston Scientific Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 17, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 17, 201269Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.297 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $5.077 billion as of December 31, 2010. We recorded $87 million of other assets and $131 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2011, as compared to $82 million of other assets and $189 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2010. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by $230 million as of December 31, 2011 and $297 million as of December 31, 2010. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollars value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by $281 million as of December 31, 2011 and by $363 million as of December 31, 2010. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations.Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $850 million in the first quarter of 2011 to convert fixed rate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floating rate debt, and subsequently terminated these hedges during the third quarter of 2011. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, $4.257 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing nearly 100 percent of our total debt.See Note E Fair Value Measurements to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments.70Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 17, 201271Table of Contents
