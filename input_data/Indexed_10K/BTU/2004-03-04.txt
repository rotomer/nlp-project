Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 29 active coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions and in Australia. In 2003, we sold 203.2 million tons of coal that accounted for an estimated 18% of all U.S. coal sales, and were more than 70% greater than the sales of our closest competitor. The Energy Information Administration estimates that 1.1 billion tons of coal were consumed in the United States in 2003 and expects domestic consumption of coal by electricity generators to grow at a rate of 1.8% per year through 2025. Coal fueled generation is used in most cases to meet baseload requirements, and coal use generally grows at the pace of electricity growth. In 2003, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 52%, which was more than all other fuels combined. Our primary customers are U.S. utilities, which accounted for 90% of our sales in 2003. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2003, 90% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2003, we had entered into commitments to sell 183 million tons, or approximately 96% of our expected 2004 production. As discussed more fully in Risks Relating to Our Company, our results of operations in the near term can be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions and unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments (particularly in the western United States). On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine or increase the cost of mining coal. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We conduct business through three principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Eastern U.S. Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Eastern U.S. Mining and Western U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. The Eastern U.S. Mining operations also mine metallurgical 37 Table of Contents coal, sold to steel and coke producers. Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Conversely, Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Geologically, Eastern operations mine bituminous and Western operations mine primarily subbituminous coal deposits. Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Appalachia and Midwest operations, and our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin and Southwest operations, which are each described in Item 1 of this report. The Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the marketing, brokerage and trading of coal. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 86% of revenues in 2003, we also generate revenues from brokering and trading coal (12% of revenues), and by aggressively managing our vast natural resource position by selling non core land holdings and mineral interests to generate additional cash flows ($37.5 million in 2003). We are developing coal fueled generating projects in areas of the country where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. These projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Two projects are currently being evaluated a 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky and a 1,500 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in Washington County, Illinois. The plants are expected to be operational following a four year construction phase, which would begin when the company has completed necessary permitting, selected partners and sold the majority of the output of the plant. Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations in 2003 and 2002 below includes references to, and analysis of our Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 28 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Summary In 2003, our revenues rose to $2.83 billion, a 4.1% increase over the prior year, led by industry record sales volume of 203.2 million tons. Our sales volume in the second half of 2003 was 8.6% stronger than the first half as generators completed upgrades to emission control equipment and increased coal consumption to meet growing industrial demand. Our Adjusted EBITDA totaled $410.3 million for the full year, compared with $406.1 million in the prior year. The improvement was due to higher U.S. Mining results (excluding $37.1 million in contract settlements from 2002 results), Trading and Brokerage results, and net gains on property disposals, partially offset by higher retiree healthcare and pension costs and selling and administrative expenses. Net income in 2003 totaled $31.3 million, or $0.57 per share, compared with $105.5 million, or $1.96 per share in 2002. The decrease in net income was due to higher asset retirement obligation costs resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 143, combined with $53.5 million in early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, both recorded in the first half of 2003. 38 Table of Contents Revenues Year Ended Year Ended Increase (Decrease) December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (dollars in thousands) Sales $ 2,729,323 $ 2,630,371 $ 98,952 3.8% Other revenues 100,157 86,727 13,430 15.5% Total revenues $ 2,829,480 $ 2,717,098 $ 112,382 4.1% Overall, our revenues increased 4.1% over the prior year. Sales increased 3.8% due to a 5.2% sales volume improvement in 2003. Volume from our brokerage operations increased substantially in 2003 due to improved domestic and export demand, and the inclusion of a full year of sales from the Australian mining operations acquired in August 2002 also contributed to the volume increase. In the west, revenues were essentially flat compared with the prior year, as record volumes due to strong second half demand in the Powder River Basin were offset by lower volumes in the Southwest as a result of customer outages due to major power plant repairs in the first half of the year. In the east, revenues declined 5.0% as slightly higher volumes in the Midwest to meet higher demand were more than offset by lower production in Appalachia due to poor weather in both the first and second quarters, and lower production at the Harris Mine and certain contract mines due to equipment and geologic difficulties. Midwest production overcame ramp up issues at the new Highland Mine and the Vermilion Grove portal of the Riola Mine, which have not yet reached full production capacity. Overall, our average sales price decreased 1.4%, due to $27.7 million in sales recorded in 2002 as a result of a favorable arbitration ruling that resulted in a retroactive price adjustment to our Navajo station coal supply agreement, combined with a change in sales mix, as higher priced tons in the Appalachia and Midwest regions represented a lower percentage of our overall sales in 2003. On a regional basis, excluding the effect of the arbitration ruling in the prior year, in 2003 we realized comparable pricing in Appalachia, and improved pricing in the Southwest and Powder River Basin. Midwest prices decreased slightly from 2002 levels. Other revenues increased $13.4 million from the prior year, due to $6.6 million in higher mark to market revenues from trading operations, combined with $8.3 million of higher earnings from equity investments in 2003. Adjusted EBITDA Our Adjusted EBITDA totaled $410.3 million for the full year, compared with $406.1 million in the prior year, broken down as follows. Year Ended Year Ended Increase (Decrease) December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 357,021 $ 355,955 $ 1,066 0.3% Eastern U.S. Mining 199,114 220,340 (21,226 ) 9.6% Trading and Brokerage 45,828 36,984 8,844 23.9% Australian Mining 2,225 3,007 (782 ) 26.0% Corporate and Other (193,910 ) (210,185 ) 16,275 7.7% Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 410,278 $ 406,101 $ 4,177 1.0% Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $1.1 million in 2003. Excluding $37.1 million from 2002 results related to a favorable arbitration ruling and a mediated settlement, Western U.S. Mining Adjusted EBITDA improved $38.2 million, and our margin per ton improved $0.28, or 11%. The improvement was driven by our Powder River Basin operations, which realized improved pricing and record volume from strong demand for its products, combined with lower maintenance and repair costs, that overcame higher fuel and explosives costs. Adjusted EBITDA from our 39 Table of Contents Eastern operations decreased $21.2 million (margin per ton decreased $0.27, or 6%) as a result of a $30.3 million decrease in contribution from our Appalachia operations, primarily due to lower production and higher costs at the Harris Mine, as a result of geologic difficulties, and equipment related operating difficulties at certain contract mines in 2003. This decrease was partially offset by a $9.1 million improvement in our Midwest operations results. The Midwest operations benefited from higher overall volume and improved pricing at our Black Beauty operations, which overcame higher fuel and explosives costs at our Black Beauty operations and ramp up issues at the new Highland Mine and the Vermilion Grove portal of the Riola Mine, which have not reached full production capacity. Adjusted EBITDA from Trading and Brokerage operations increased $8.8 million over the prior year, primarily due to higher profit from improved brokerage volume and the impact of adopting EITF Issue 02 3 Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Trading and Brokerage results in 2003 included $6.8 million in unrealized profit related to a contract restructuring wherein the new contracts terms and conditions required it to be classified as a derivative (and therefore marked to market). The unrealized profit related to this contract will be converted to cash by the end of 2005. An additional $5.3 million of unrealized profit related to three other contract modifications, and the unrealized profit related to these contracts will be converted to cash by the end of 2004. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on property disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. In 2003, these result were impacted by: higher net gains on property disposals of $9.4 million; a $7.6 million gain in 2003 on the sale of 1.15 million units of Penn Virginia Resource Partners LP (Penn Virginia); higher selling and administrative expenses of $7.1 million associated with salaried pensions, incentive compensation, litigation, additional healthcare cost controls and Sarbanes Oxley compliance; and lower costs ($7.3 million) associated with past mining obligations, as the prior year included a $17.2 million charge related to an adverse U.S. Supreme Court decision which assigned us responsibility for the health care premiums of certain beneficiaries previously withdrawn by the Social Security Administration, while the current year included higher retiree healthcare costs of $8.9 million.

Expense in 2002 related to reclamation activities was $11.0 million and was included in operating costs and expenses in the statement of operations. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Interest expense in 2003 decreased $3.9 million, due to $8.9 million in savings realized from our 2003 refinancing, partially offset by $5.0 million higher costs related to surety bonds and letters of credit used to secure our obligations for reclamation, workers compensation and lease commitments. Prior year interest income included $4.6 million in interest income received related to excise tax refunds. Net Income Year Ended Year Ended Increase (Decrease) December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (dollars in thousands) Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ (3,181 ) $ 78,804 $ (81,985 ) 104.0 % Income tax benefit (47,708 ) (40,007 ) 7,701 19.2 % Minority interests 3,035 13,292 (10,257 ) 77.2 % Income before accounting changes 41,492 105,519 (64,027 ) 60.7 % Cumulative effect of accounting changes (10,144 ) (10,144 ) Net income $ 31,348 $ 105,519 $ (74,171 ) 70.3 % Net income decreased $74.2 million from 2002 due to the decrease in income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, combined with: a higher tax benefit of $7.7 million in 2003. The tax benefit recorded in 2003 differs from the tax expense in 2002 primarily as a result of the magnitude of the percentage depletion deduction (which is a permanent difference) relative to pre tax income, and a $10.0 million adjustment to our tax reserves; lower minority interests expense in 2003 due to the purchase of the remaining 25% of Arclar Coal Company in September 2002 and the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of EITF No. 98 10, as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 (Not Presented Herein) Summary In 2002, our revenues rose to $2.72 billion, a 4.1% increase from 2001, due primarily to higher pricing from contracts signed in 2001. Our Adjusted EBITDA totaled $406.1 million in 2002, compared with $559.7 million in 2001, which included a $171.7 million gain on the sale of our Peabody Resources Limited operations in Australia. Excluding the gain on sale of the Peabody Resources Limited operations, Adjusted EBITDA increased $18.1 million, or 4.7%. The improvement was due to higher U.S. Mining and Trading and Brokerage results partially offset by higher costs related past mining obligations and lower coal royalties. Income before taxes and minority interests decreased $66.8 million in 2002, due primarily to the $171.7 million gain on the sale of our Peabody Resources Limited operations in 2001, partially offset by $49.7 million in early debt extinguishment charges in 2001, lower interest expense in 2002 of $30.5 million 41 Table of Contents and higher Adjusted EBITDA in 2002 of $18.1 million (excluding the gain on sale of the Peabody Resources Limited operations). Revenues (Unaudited) Year Ended Year Ended Increase (Decrease) December 31, December 31, 2002 2001 $ % (dollars in thousands) Revenues Sales $ 2,630,371 $ 2,514,591 $ 115,780 4.6 % Other revenues 86,727 94,592 (7,865 ) 8.3 % Total revenues $ 2,717,098 $ 2,609,183 $ 107,915 4.1 % Overall, our revenues increased 4.1% in 2002 from 2001. Sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $115.8 million, or 4.6%, to $2,630.4 million. U.S. sales increased $121.9 million, a 4.9% increase from the prior year. Pricing increases in all regions drove the sales increase. Our average sales price was 5.6% higher than the prior year. The average price increase was impacted by higher priced contracts signed in 2001 and a $27.7 million increase in sales related to a favorable arbitration ruling that resulted in a retroactive price increase on our Navajo station coal supply agreement. The pricing increase was partially mitigated by sales mix, as higher priced tons in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations represented a lower percentage of overall sales in the current year compared to the prior year. U.S. mining and broker operations sales volume for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 183.5 million tons, which was 2.2 million tons below the prior year. We had lower sales volume at our Eastern U.S. Mining operations, driven by soft market demand as a result of mild weather early in the year, a slower U.S. economy and more aggressive management of coal stockpile levels by customers. Volume decreases at our eastern operations more than offset a 1.4 million ton increase in sales volume at our western operations. In the west, our Powder River Basin sales increased $130.3 million, due to improved pricing and slightly higher volume in the current year, driven by continued strong customer demand. Sales in the Southwest region were $33.9 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to the effect of the arbitration ruling previously discussed. In the east, Appalachia region sales increased $7.7 million, as higher pricing offset lower volume from softer demand, which resulted in the suspension of the Big Mountain Mine twice during the year and the Colony Bay Mine during the fourth quarter. Midwest region sales decreased $31.0 million, as higher prices were more than offset by lower volume due to geologic problems at the Camp No. 11 Mine and delays in the startup of two new mines in the region, combined with softer coal demand in the current year. Finally, sales from coal brokerage activities decreased $20.3 million due to a change in sales mix and slightly lower volume. Other revenues decreased $7.9 million from 2001, to $86.7 million. Revenues in 2002 included a $15.1 million gain from a mediated settlement related to the Mohave generating station coal supply agreement, offset by significantly lower coal royalty revenues, as 2001 included higher coal royalties of $12.0 million, primarily due to two non refundable advance royalties, and $9.9 million of revenue in 2001 related to the monetization of coal brokerage agreements that had increased in value due to favorable market conditions. 42 Table of Contents Adjusted EBITDA (Unaudited) Year Ended Year Ended Increase (Decrease) December 31, December 31, 2002 2001 $ % (dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 355,955 $ 298,609 $ 57,346 19.2 % Eastern U.S. Mining 220,340 198,116 22,224 11.2 % Trading and Brokerage 36,984 31,645 5,339 16.9 % Australian Mining 3,007 6,393 (3,386 ) 53.0 % Gain on sale of Peabody Resources Ltd. 171,735 (171,735 ) 100.0 % Corporate and Other (210,185 ) (146,749 ) (63,436 ) 43.2 % Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 406,101 $ 559,749 $ (153,648 ) 27.4 % Excluding the effect of the $171.7 million gain on sale of our Peabody Resources Limited operations, Adjusted EBITDA increased $18.1 million in 2002, or 4.7%, to $406.1 million. Both the Western U.S. Mining and Eastern U.S. Mining segments EBITDA increased as a result of higher overall pricing due to contracts signed in 2001. Western U.S. Mining results include the effects of the Navajo station arbitration ruling and Mohave station mediated settlement, which increased Adjusted EBITDA by $37.1 million. In the west, the Powder River Basin regions Adjusted EBITDA increased $35.1 million as improved prices and higher volume overcame higher royalty and tax expenses associated with improved prices, higher repair and maintenance costs and higher fixed costs associated with running mines at lower than anticipated capacity in 2002. The Southwest regions Adjusted EBITDA increased $22.2 million as the $37.1 million increase related to the Navajo arbitration ruling and Mohave mediated settlement was partially offset by higher truck, dragline and shovel maintenance and repairs expense. In addition, two outages of the Southwest regions coal transportation pipeline contributed to higher costs in the current year. In the east, both regions profits were negatively impacted by running mines at lower than anticipated capacity in the current year and charges in the fourth quarter related to the suspension of two mines in Appalachia due to lower than anticipated demand and the early closure of the Camp No. 11 Mine in the Midwest due to geologic difficulties. Despite these issues, Adjusted EBITDA in the Midwest region increased $14.8 million compared to the prior year, as lower overall sales levels in the region and geologic difficulties at the Camp No. 11 mine were more than offset by improved pricing and lower fuel and maintenance and repair costs at Black Beauty. The Appalachia regions Adjusted EBITDA increased $7.4 million due to strong sales price improvement, which overcame higher per ton mining costs due to lower than planned production volume, the mine suspensions previously mentioned and production difficulties at the Harris Mines longwall. Adjusted EBITDA from trading and brokerage operations increased $5.3 million over the prior year, primarily due to $10.0 million in profit related to a forward sale that settles during 2003 and 2004. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on property disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. In 2002, these result were impacted by: higher costs related to post mining activities of $36.2 million, primarily due to $14.1 million of higher excise tax refunds in the prior year and a $17.2 million charge in the current year related to an adverse U.S. Supreme Court decision which assigned us responsibility for the health care premiums of certain beneficiaries previously withdrawn by the Social Security Administration as a result of a prior U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision. The remainder of the year over year increase related primarily to higher retiree healthcare costs. 43 Table of Contents lower coal royalty income of $12.8 million and lower results from other commercial activities of $7.3 million.

The $30.5 million decrease in interest expense was due to significant long term debt repayments made during 2001, and lower short term interest rates in 2002. Utilizing proceeds from the sale of our Peabody Resources Limited operations in January 2001 and our initial public offering in May 2001, we reduced long term debt by approximately $0.8 billion during 2001. Net Income (Unaudited) Year Ended Year Ended Increase (Decrease) December 31, December 31, 2002 2001 $ % (dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 78,804 $ 145,652 $ (66,848 ) 45.9 % Income tax provision (benefit) (40,007 ) 29,331 69,338 236.4 % Minority interests 13,292 10,131 3,161 31.2 % Income from continuing operations 105,519 106,190 (671 ) 0.6 % Income from discontinued operations 1,165 (1,165 ) 100.0 % Net income $ 105,519 $ 107,355 $ (1,836 ) 1.7 % Net income decreased $1.8 million from 2001 due to the decrease in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, combined with a $69.3 million increase in income tax benefits. For 2002, we had an income tax benefit of $40.0 million on income before income taxes and minority interests of $78.8 million, compared to income tax expense of $29.3 million on income before income taxes and minority interests of $145.7 million in the prior year. Overall, our effective tax rate is sensitive to the benefit of the percentage depletion tax deduction relative to our annual profitability, as well as our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss carryforwards. In 2001, the provision was affected by the sale of our Peabody Resources Limited operations. In 2002, our tax provision reflected significant tax benefits realized as a result of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable gains recognized in connection with the Penn Virginia coal reserves and landfill sale transactions. Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards allowed for the reduction of a previously recorded valuation allowance that had reduced the carrying value of our net operating loss carryforward tax benefits. 44 Table of Contents Outlook Our outlook for the coal markets is positive for 2004, as indicated by strong domestic and international pricing, especially in late 2003 and early 2004. Strong demand for coal based electricity generation is being driven by a strengthening economy, low customer stockpiles, production difficulties of some producers, capacity constraints of nuclear generation and high prices of natural gas and oil. The high price of the primary competing fuel, natural gas, is leading to coal generating plants operating at increasing levels. We are targeting 2004 production of 190 to 195 million tons, and total sales volume of 210 million to 220 million tons. As of December 31, 2003 we have committed 183 million tons and priced 181 million tons of 2004 production. Increased demand for our products contributes to an improved cost structure as we are able to more fully utilize our installed production capacity. We continue to aggressively manage our cost structure and have programs in place to limit, to the extent possible, the impact of rising costs on our operating margins. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to higher fuel and explosives costs driven by higher energy prices, higher steel costs, healthcare costs and other costs. In addition, historically low interest rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on these and other costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities Our subsidiaries have significant long term liabilities for postretirement benefit costs, workers compensation obligations and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 for these liabilities totaled $156.1 million, while payments were $146.7 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. 45 Table of Contents Health care cost trend rate (dollars in thousands): One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 10,014 $ (8,389 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 111,745 $ (94,218 ) Discount rate (dollars in thousands): One Half One Half Percentage Point Percentage Point Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 790 $ (956 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (51,971 ) $ 57,180 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.43 years at December 31, 2003. Asset Retirement Obligations Our method for accounting for reclamation activities changed on January 1, 2003 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The asset retirement obligation is determined on a by mine basis and we use various assumptions, including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data and the timing of and costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $31.2 million, and payments totaled $38.1 million. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal in over the counter markets. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal and emission allowance positions. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Ninety nine percent of the contracts in our trading portfolio as of December 31, 2003 were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality, and one percent of our contracts were valued based on similar market transactions. As of December 31, 2003, the timing of trading portfolio contract expirations is as follows: Percentage of Year of Expiration Portfolio 2004 93 % 2005 7 % 100 % 46 Table of Contents Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities and sales of non core assets. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. We typically fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations, and, particularly in 2003, have had few borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit. This provides us with available excess borrowing capacity ($363.4 million as of December 31, 2003) to use to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs. Cash provided by operating activities was $188.9 million in 2003, a decrease of $45.9 million from 2002. The decrease is primarily due to lower income from continuing operations in the current year, combined with a higher portion of 2003 income generated by activities whose related cash flows are classified as cash flows from investing activities. In addition, the prior year periods cash flows include $26.8 million of excise tax refunds and $33.9 million received related to the arbitration ruling and mediation settlement previously mentioned. Net cash used in investing activities was $192.3 million in 2003, $48.2 million lower than 2002. Capital expenditures decreased $52.1 million, to $156.4 million, in 2003. The decrease was driven by the deferral of some 2003 capital spending to 2004, combined with higher expenditures for reserve acquisitions in 2002. Major capital expenditures incurred in 2003 related to the startup of the Highland Mine and the installation of new longwall equipment and development of a new reserve area at our 5 million ton per year Federal Mine. Other capital expenditures were primarily for the replacement of mining equipment, the expansion of capacity at certain mines and projects to improve the efficiency of mining operations. Acquisition expenditures increased $45.4 million in the current year, due to the $90.0 million acquisition of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company in 2003. The prior year included $45.5 million of expenditures related to the acquisitions of Beaver Dam Coal Company, the remaining 25% interest in Arclar Coal Company and our Australian Mining operations. In addition, 2003 included $32.1 million in proceeds from the sale of 1.15 million units of Penn Virginia, while 2002 included $72.5 million from the sale of reserves to Penn Virginia. Finally, the current year includes $15.4 million lower proceeds from property and equipment disposals. Net cash provided by financing activities was $48.6 million in 2003, a $107.0 million increase from 2002. The current year included proceeds from long term debt of $1.1 billion from the refinancing transactions. A detailed discussion of the sources and uses of proceeds from the refinancing transactions is included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. The refinancing proceeds were used, among other things, to repay line of credit borrowings of $121.6 million, long term debt of $831.0 million and to pay $23.7 million in debt issuance costs in connection with the new debt issued. The current year includes other debt repayments of $37.4 million, while 2002 includes net repayments of $31.3 million. Financing cash flows in 2003 and 2002 reflect dividends paid of $24.1 million and $20.9 million, respectively. Finally, 47 Table of Contents 2003 included lower proceeds from securitized interests in accounts receivable of $42.8 million and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $28.7 million. The Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 22, 2003. Once the registration statement is effective, the Company may offer and sell from time to time unsecured debt securities consisting of notes, debentures, and other debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants; and or units totaling a maximum of $1.25 billion. Related proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of other debt, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions and any other purposes that may be stated in any prospectus supplement. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, our total indebtedness consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2003 December 31, 2002 Term Loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility $ 446,625 $ 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 Fair value of interest rate swaps 6.875% Senior Notes 4,239 9.625% Senior Subordinated Notes redeemed in 2003 391,490 8.875% Senior Notes redeemed in 2003 316,498 5.0% Subordinated Note 79,412 85,055 Senior unsecured notes under various agreements 58,214 Unsecured revolving credit agreement 116,584 Other 16,263 61,370 $ 1,196,539 $ 1,029,211 During 2003, we completed a comprehensive debt refinancing to lower our borrowing costs, expand our borrowing capacity, extend our debt maturities and simplify our capital structure. The new debt instruments are discussed in detail in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Our Senior Secured Credit Facility and 6.875% Senior Notes have been rated Ba1 and BB , respectively, by Moodys Investors Service, BB+ and BB by Standard & Poors and BB+ and BB by Fitch. Recently, Moodys reaffirmed our SGL 1 liquidity rating. Under Moodys rating system, SGL 1 means very good liquidity. Moodys SGL ratings are used to supplement their credit ratings for companies rated from Ba1 to C. These security ratings reflect the views of the rating agencies only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from each rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and 6.875% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2003. In July 2003, our board of directors approved a 25% increase in the regular quarterly dividend on common stock, to $0.125 per share. In May 2003, we entered into and designated four interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $100.0 million as a fair value hedge of our 6.875% Senior Notes. Under the swaps, the Company pays a floating rate that resets each March 15 and September 15, based upon the six month LIBOR rate, for a period of ten years ending March 15, 2013 and receives a fixed rate of 6.875%. The average applicable floating rate of the four swaps was 4.25% as of December 31, 2003. At current LIBOR levels, we would realize annualized savings of approximately $2.6 million over the term of the swaps. In September 2003, the Company entered into two $400.0 million interest rate swaps. One $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2010, was 48 Table of Contents designated as a hedge of changes in expected cash flows on the term loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under this swap, the Company pays a fixed rate of 6.764% and receives a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% (3.67% at December 31, 2003) that resets quarterly based upon the three month LIBOR rate. Another $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2013, was designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Under this swap, the Company pays a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.97% (3.14% at December 31, 2003) that resets quarterly based upon the three month LIBOR rate and receives a fixed rate of 6.875%. The effect of the swaps was to lower the Companys overall borrowing costs on $400.0 million of debt principal by 0.64% as of December 31, 2003, which will result in annualized interest savings of $2.6 million over the term of the fixed to floating swap. The following is a summary of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 600,000 $ 600,000 As of December 31, 2003, there were no outstanding borrowings under our $600.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. We had letters of credit outstanding under the facility of $236.6 million, leaving $363.4 million available for borrowing. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): Payments Due by Year Within After 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt (principal and interest) $ 83,983 $ 154,868 $ 173,178 $ 1,262,371 Capital lease obligations 1,474 1,529 353 Operating leases 90,833 147,160 85,013 56,782 Capital purchase obligations(1) 39,566 Coal reserve lease obligations 25,362 53,279 44,187 52,672 Total contractual cash obligations $ 241,218 $ 356,836 $ 302,731 $ 1,371,825 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which are not recognized as a liability until the purchased items are received) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. Additionally, we have long term liabilities relating to retiree health care (postretirement benefits and multi employer benefit plans), work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. The following is the estimated spending related to these items as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): Estimated Expenditures Within 1 year $ 185,300 2 3 years 414,700 4 5 years 394,500 49 Table of Contents We had $39.6 million of committed capital expenditures at December 31, 2003. Total capital expenditures for 2004 are expected to range from $220 million to $240 million, and have been and will be primarily used to develop existing reserves, replace or add equipment, acquire additional low sulfur or other strategic coal reserves and fund cost reduction initiatives. We anticipate funding these capital expenditures through operating cash flow. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related and reclamation liabilities included above are expected to be funded from operating cash flow, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases and coal reserves. We believe the risk of generating lower than anticipated operating cash flow in 2004 is reduced by our high level of sales commitments (96% of 2004 planned production) and ongoing efforts to improve our operating cost structure. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use surety bonds to secure our reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations. As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding surety bonds with third parties for post mining reclamation totaling $499.6 million. We had an additional $178.9 million of surety bonds in place for workers compensation and retiree healthcare obligations and $66.0 million of surety bonds securing coal leases. Recently, surety bond costs have increased, while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable to us. To the extent that surety bonds become unavailable, we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit, cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral. We have guaranteed $7.6 million of debt of an affiliate in which we have a 49% equity investment, and $4.0 million of debt of an affiliate in which we have 45% investment, as described in Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements. We maintain letters of credit totaling $239.1 million to secure lease, workers compensation, postretirement benefits, and other obligations. Our remaining guarantees and indemnifications are discussed in Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements. In March 2000, we established an accounts receivable securitization program. Under the program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to the Seller are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We used proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable to repay long term debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The securitization program is currently scheduled to expire in 2007. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, the securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from our consolidated balance sheet. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit were $90.0 million as of December 31, 2003. A detailed description of our $140.0 million accounts receivable securitization is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Mining Industry Accounting Issues Emerging Issues Task Force Historical practice in extractive industries has been to classify leased coal interests and advance royalties as tangible assets, which is consistent with the classification of owned coal due to the similar rights of the leaseholder. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, provides mineral rights as an example of a contract based intangible asset that should be considered for separate classification as the result of a business combination. Due to the potential for inconsistencies in applying the provisions of SFAS No. 141 (and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) in the extractive industries as they relate to mineral interests controlled by other than fee ownership, the Emerging Issues Task Force (the EITF) has established a Mining Industry Working Group that is currently addressing this issue. The classification 50 Table of Contents of our leased coal interests and advance royalties in our consolidated balance sheet may be revised depending upon the conclusions reached by the Mining Industry Working Group and the EITF. Other On February 29, 2004, we signed two definitive agreements to purchase three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Closing on the transactions is expected within the next three months and requires no additional U.S. or Australian regulatory approvals. The combined purchase price is $441 million in cash, subject to certain price adjustments. The purchase includes two mines in Queensland, Australia that produce 7 to 8 million tons per year of metallurgical coal, and the Twentymile Mine in Colorado, which produces 7.5 million tons per year of low sulfur steam coal. We continue with a memorandum of understanding with RAG Coal International AG for our purchase of a 25 percent interest in Carbones del Guasare, S.A., a joint venture that includes Anglo American plc and a Venezuelan governmental partner. Carbones del Guasare operates the Paso Diablo surface mine in northwestern Venezuela, which produces approximately 7 million tons per year of coal for electricity generators and steel producers. Risks Relating to Our Company If a substantial portion of our long term coal supply agreements terminate, our revenues and operating profits could suffer if we were unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms to those in our contracts. A substantial portion of our sales is made under coal supply agreements, which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations. The execution of a satisfactory coal supply agreement is frequently the basis on which we undertake the development of coal reserves required to be supplied under the contract. For the year ended December 31, 2003, 90% of our sales volume was sold under long term coal supply agreements. At December 31, 2003, our coal supply agreements had remaining terms ranging from one to 18 years and an average volume weighted remaining term of approximately 3.9 years. Many of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price upward or downward at specified times. We may adjust these contract prices based on inflation or deflation and or changes in the factors affecting the cost of producing coal, such as taxes, fees, royalties and changes in the laws regulating the mining, production, sale or use of coal. In a limited number of contracts, failure of the parties to agree on a price under those provisions may allow either party to terminate the contract. We sometimes experience a reduction in coal prices in new long term coal supply agreements replacing some of our expiring contracts. Coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party. Most coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as Btu, sulfur content, ash content, grindability and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts. Moreover, some of these agreements permit the customer to terminate the contract if transportation costs, which our customers typically bear, increase substantially. In addition, some of these contracts allow our customers to terminate their contracts in the event of changes in regulations affecting our industry that increase the price of coal beyond specified limits. The operating profits we realize from coal sold under supply agreements depend on a variety of factors. In addition, price adjustment and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility provided by those contracts. If a substantial portion of our coal supply agreements were modified or terminated, we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to find alternate buyers for our coal at the same level of profitability. Some of our coal supply agreements are for prices above current market prices. Although market prices for coal increased in most regions in 2001, market prices for coal decreased in most regions in 2002. In 2003, pricing improved for eastern coal regions and moved slightly higher for western coal regions. As a result, we cannot predict the future 51 Table of Contents strength of the coal market and cannot assure you that we will be able to replace existing long term coal supply agreements at the same prices or with similar profit margins when they expire. In addition, two of our coal supply agreements are the subject of ongoing litigation and arbitration. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we derived 26% of our total coal revenues from sales to our five largest customers. At December 31, 2003, we had 28 coal supply agreements with these customers that expire at various times from 2004 to 2012. We are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long term agreements with some of these customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and those customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long term coal supply agreements. If a number of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially. Peabody Western has a long term coal supply agreement with the owners of the Mohave Generating Station that expires on December 31, 2005. There is a dispute with the Hopi Tribe regarding the use of groundwater in the transportation of the coal by pipeline to the Mohave plant. Southern California Edison (the majority owner and operator of the plant) is involved in a California Public Utilities Commission proceeding related to recovery of future capital expenditures for new pollution abatement equipment for the station. Alternatively, Southern California Edison has asked for authorization to spend money for the shutdown of the Mohave plant. In a July 2003 filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, the operator affirmed that the Mohave plant is not forecast to return to service as a coal fired resource until mid 2009 at the earliest. The Company is in active discussions to resolve the complex issues critical to the continuation of the operation of the Mohave Generating Station and the renewal of the coal supply agreement after December 31, 2005. There is no assurance that the issues critical to the continued operation of the Mohave plant will be resolved. If these issues are not resolved in a timely manner, the operation of the Mohave plant will cease or be suspended on December 31, 2005. The Mohave plant is the sole customer of the Black Mesa Mine, which sold 4.5 million tons of coal in 2003. If the Company is unable to renew the coal supply agreement with the Mohave Generating Station, our results of operations and cash flows could be somewhat reduced after 2005. Our financial performance could be adversely affected by our substantial debt. Our financial performance could be affected by our substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2003, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,196.5 million, and we had $363.4 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to: making it more difficult for us to pay interest and satisfy our debt obligations; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate uses; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the coal industry; and 52 Table of Contents placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors. In addition, our indebtedness subjects us to financial and other restrictive covenants. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets secure our indebtedness under our credit facility. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The new credit facility and the indenture governing the notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If transportation for our coal becomes unavailable or uneconomic for our customers, our ability to sell coal could suffer. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customers purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy or could make some of our operations less competitive than other sources of coal. Certain coal supply agreements permit the customer to terminate the contract if the cost of transportation increases by an amount ranging from 10% to 20% in any given 12 month period. Coal producers depend upon rail, barge, trucking, overland conveyor and other systems to deliver coal to markets. While U.S. coal customers typically arrange and pay for transportation of coal from the mine to the point of use, disruption of these transportation services because of weather related problems, strikes, lock outs or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers and thus could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, the high volume of coal shipped from all Powder River Basin mines could create temporary congestion on the rail systems servicing that region. Risks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating our business. Our mining operations are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include weather and natural disasters, unexpected maintenance problems, key equipment failures, variations in coal seam thickness, variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the coal deposit, variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geologic conditions. The government extensively regulates our mining operations, which imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal. Federal, state and local authorities regulate the coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. In addition, significant legislation mandating specified benefits for retired coal miners affects our industry. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment. The costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production. The possibility exists that new legislation and or regulations and orders may be 53 Table of Contents adopted that may materially adversely affect our mining operations, our cost structure and or our customers ability to use coal. New legislation or administrative regulations (or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations), including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. The majority of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchasers plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use. These factors and legislation, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the United States and over 160 other nations are signatories to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is intended to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. In December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, the signatories to the convention established a binding set of emission targets for developed nations. Although the specific emission targets vary from country to country, the United States would be required to reduce emissions to 93% of 1990 levels over a five year budget period from 2008 through 2012. Although the United States has not ratified the emission targets and no comprehensive regulations focusing on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are in place, these restrictions, whether through ratification of the emission targets or other efforts to stabilize or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, could adversely impact the price of and demand for coal. According to the Energy Information Administrations Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2002, coal accounts for 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions could result in reduced use of coal if electricity generators switch to sources of fuel with lower carbon dioxide emissions. Further developments in connection with regulations or other limits on carbon dioxide emissions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. We provide postretirement health and life insurance benefits to eligible union and non union employees. We calculated the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, which we estimate had a present value of $1,034.3 million as of December 31, 2003, $72.5 million of which was a current liability. We have estimated these unfunded obligations based on assumptions described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits. We are party to an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or the PBGC, and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make specified contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guaranty in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States). As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guaranty. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries participate in two multi employer pension funds and have an obligation to contribute to a multi employer defined contribution benefit fund. Contributions to these funds could increase as a result of future collective bargaining with the United Mine Workers of America, a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency of other coal companies who currently contribute to these funds, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, higher medical and drug costs or other 54 Table of Contents funding deficiencies. Certain of our subsidiaries are statutorily obligated to contribute to the 1992 Fund under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. Our future success depends upon our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves that are economically recoverable. Our recoverable reserves decline as we produce coal. We have not yet applied for the permits required or developed the mines necessary to use all of our reserves. Furthermore, we may not be able to mine all of our reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations. Our future success depends upon our conducting successful exploration and development activities or acquiring properties containing economically recoverable reserves. Our current strategy includes increasing our reserves through acquisitions of government and other leases and producing properties and continuing to use our existing properties. The federal government also leases natural gas and coalbed methane reserves in the west, including in the Powder River Basin. Some of these natural gas and coalbed methane reserves are located on, or adjacent to, some of our Powder River Basin reserves, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and lessees of those interests. Other lessees rights relating to these mineral interests could prevent, delay or increase the cost of developing our coal reserves. These lessees may also seek damages from us based on claims that our coal mining operations impair their interests. Additionally, the federal government limits the amount of federal land that may be leased by any company to 150,000 acres nationwide. As of December 31, 2003, we leased or had applied to lease a total of 69,402 acres from the federal government. The limit could restrict our ability to lease additional federal lands. Our planned mine development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have continuing success developing additional mines. Most of our mining operations are conducted on properties owned or leased by us. Because title to most of our leased properties and mineral rights are not thoroughly verified until a permit to mine the property is obtained, our right to mine some of our reserves may be materially adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist. In addition, in order to develop our reserves, we must receive various governmental permits. We cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the permits necessary for us to operate profitably in the future. We may not be able to negotiate new leases from the government or from private parties or obtain mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interest in properties on which mining operations are not commenced during the term of the lease. From time to time, we have experienced litigation with lessors of our coal properties and with royalty holders. If the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future, our profitability could be impaired. During the mid 1970s and early 1980s, a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry, spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry, all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices. Similarly, an increase in future coal prices could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers. Any overcapacity could reduce coal prices in the future. Our financial condition could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations. As of December 31, 2003, the United Mine Workers of America represented approximately 30% of our employees, who generated 18% of our production during 2003. An additional 5% of our employees are represented by labor unions other than the United Mine Workers of America. These employees generated 2% of our production during 2003. Because of the higher labor costs and the increased risk of strikes and other work related stoppages that may be associated with union operations in the coal industry, our non unionized competitors may have a competitive advantage in areas where they compete with our unionized operations. If some or all of our current non union operations were to become unionized, we could incur an increased risk of work stoppages, reduced productivity and higher labor costs. The 10 month United Mine Workers of America strike in 1993 had a material adverse effect on us. Two of our subsidiaries, Peabody Coal Company and Eastern Associated Coal Corp., operate under a union contract that is in 55 Table of Contents effect through December 31, 2006. Peabody Western Coal Company operates under a union contract that is in effect through September 1, 2005. Our operations could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain required surety bonds. Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers compensation, to secure coal lease obligations and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding surety bonds with third parties for post mining reclamation totaling $499.6 million. We had an additional $178.9 million of surety bonds in place for workers compensation and retiree healthcare obligations and $66.0 million of surety bonds securing coal leases. These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. It has become increasingly difficult for us to secure new surety bonds or renew bonds without the posting of partial collateral. In addition, surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable to us. Surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including the following: lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds; restrictions on the availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of our indenture or new credit facility; and the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety. In addition, if we were required, as a result of the EITFs mining accounting issues project discussed above, to reclassify our leased coal interests as an intangible asset, our ability to maintain or secure surety bonds could be negatively impacted. Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Partners II L.P. and affiliates could have influence on all stockholder votes. At December 31, 2003, the Merchant Banking Fund beneficially owned approximately 19% of our common stock, and has two representatives on our Board of Directors. As a result, the Merchant Banking Fund may be able to influence the election of our directors and our corporate and management policies and actions, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. We have retained affiliates of Lehman Brothers to perform advisory and financing services for us in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, provided that the Audit Committee approves in advance all services provided by Lehman Brothers. Our ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel. We manage our business with a number of key personnel, the loss of a number of whom could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, as our business develops and expands, we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. We do not have key person life insurance to cover our executive officers. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending, and market liquidity, which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control, such as terrorist attacks and acts 56 Table of Contents of war. Future terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions affecting our customers may materially adversely affect our operations. As a result, there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to our customers, decreased sales of our coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from our customers. Strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the United States. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government imposed price controls. It is possible that any, or a combination, of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness deteriorates. Our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. Our customer base is changing with deregulation as utilities sell their power plants to their non regulated affiliates or third parties. These new power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade. In addition, the creditworthiness of certain of our customers and trading counterparties has deteriorated due to lower than anticipated demand for energy and lower volume and volatility in the traded energy markets in 2002. If deterioration of the creditworthiness of other electric power generator customers or trading counterparties continues, our $140.0 million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected. Our certificate of incorporation and by laws include provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our by laws and certificate of incorporation impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of the stockholders rights plan adopted by our board of directors. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Trading Activities We engage in over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, futures, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our policy for accounting for coal trading activities is described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We perform a value at risk analysis on our trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard risk metrics variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both option and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. 57 Table of Contents The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, including the use of delta/ gamma adjustments related to options, we perform regular stress, back testing and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.4 million, $2.0 million, and $1.0 million, respectively. Ninety three percent of the value of our trading portfolio is scheduled to be realized by the end of 2004, and the remainder of the value of our trading portfolio is scheduled to be realized by the end of 2005. We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. In the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. When appropriate, we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk, as determined by our credit management function, of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to fund the payment for coal under existing coal supply agreements. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures and certain firm purchase commitments denominated in Australian dollars. No derivatives utilized for currency hedging purposes have expiration dates beyond 2004. As of December 31, 2003, we had in place: forward contracts designated as cash flows hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling $33.0 million; option contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling $9.7 million; and forward contracts designated as fair value hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling $6.1 million. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to changes in interest rates due to our existing level of indebtedness. We manage our interest rate risk utilizing interest rate swaps, which are discussed in detail in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2003, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $644.9 million of fixed rate borrowings and $551.6 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percent increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $5.5 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase would result in a $50.8 million decrease in the fair value of these borrowings. 58 Table of Contents Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for non trading purposes through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2003. We have sales commitments for 96% of our 2004 production. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to price volatility. We, through our suppliers, utilize forward contracts to manage the exposure related to this volatility.
