Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Stock Split On March 2, 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a two for one stock split on all shares of our common stock. Shareholders of record at the close of business on March 16, 2005 will be entitled to a dividend of one share of stock for every share held. The additional shares will be distributed on March 30, 2005, and the stock will begin trading ex split on March 31, 2005. All share and per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflect the two for one stock split. Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected financial and other data about us for the most recent five fiscal periods. The following table and the discussion of our results of operations in 2004 and 2003 in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2004, our equity in earnings of affiliates and all gains on asset disposals were classified separately as a component of operating income. Prior periods have been restated to conform with current presentation. On April 15 2004, we acquired three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the results of operations of the two mines in Queensland, Australia and the results of operations of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado from the April 15, 2004 purchase date. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 include early debt extinguishment costs of $53.5 million pursuant to our debt refinancing in the first half of 2003. In addition, results included expense relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of EITF No. 98 10. These accounting changes are further discussed in Note 6 to our financial statements. In July 2001, we changed our fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31. The change was first effective with respect to the nine months ended December 31, 2001. On May 22, 2001, concurrent with our initial public offering, we converted our Class A common stock and Class B common stock into a single class of common stock, all on a one for one basis. 37 Table of Contents Results of operations for the year ended March 31, 2001 included a $171.7 million pretax gain on the sale of our Peabody Resources Limited operations in Australia. Capital expenditures of $151.4 million for this period do not include Peabody Resources Limited capital expenditures. In anticipation of the sale of Citizens Power, which occurred in August 2000, we classified Citizens Power as a discontinued operation as of March 31, 2000. Results in 2004 include a $2.8 million loss, net of taxes, from discontinued operations related to the settlement of a Citizens Power indemnification claim. Citizens Power is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. We have derived the selected historical financial data for the years ended and as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the nine months ended and as of December 31, 2001, and for the year ended and as of March 31, 2001 from our audited financial statements. All share and per share amounts included in the following consolidated financial data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a two for one stock split, effective March 30, 2005. You should read the following table in conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements, and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of operations for the historical periods included in the following table are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods. In addition, the Risks Relating To Our Company section of Item 7 of this report includes a discussion of risk factors that could impact our future results of operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 32 active coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions and internationally in Australia. In 2004, we sold 227.2 million tons of coal that accounted for an estimated 20% of all U.S. coal sales, and were more than 85% greater than the sales of our closest competitor. The Energy Information Administration estimates that 1.1 billion tons of coal were consumed in the United States in 2004 and expects domestic consumption of coal by electricity generators to grow at a rate of 1.6% per year through 2025. Coal fueled generation is used in most cases to meet baseload electricity requirements, and coal use generally grows at the pace of electricity growth. In 2004, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 52%, which was more than all other fuels used to generate electricity combined. Our primary customers are U.S. utilities, which accounted for 90% of our sales in 2004. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2004, approximately 90% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2004, we had priced more than 95% of our expected 2005 production. As discussed more fully in Risks Relating to Our Company, our results of operations in the near term can be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Eastern U.S. Mining, Western U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Appalachia and Midwest operations, and our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. The principal business of the Western U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. The principal business of the Eastern U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities, as well as the mining of some metallurgical coal, sold to steel and coke producers. Geologically, Eastern operations mine bituminous and Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Our Australian Mining operations consist of our Wilkie Creek Mine, two additional mines acquired in April 2004, Burton and North Goonyella, and our recently opened Eaglefield Mine, which is a surface operation adjacent to, and fulfilling contract tonnages in conjunction with, the North Goonyella underground mine. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining low sulfur, high Btu coal sold to an international customer base. Primarily metallurgical coal is produced from our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 4% of our total sales volume and approximately 3% of U.S. sales volume. In December 2004, we purchased a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 7 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. Each of our mining operations is described in Item 1 of this report. 40 Table of Contents In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 87% of revenues in 2004, we also generate revenues from brokering and trading coal (12% of revenues), and by creating value from our vast natural resource position by selling non core land holdings and mineral interests to generate additional cash flows. We are developing coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. These projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Three projects are currently being evaluated the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, the 1,500 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in Washington County, Illinois and the 300 megawatt Mustang Energy Project near Grants, N.M. During 2004, one of our subsidiaries and Fluor Daniel Illinois, Inc. signed a letter of intent for engineering, design and construction of Prairie States power related facilities. In January 2005, we achieved a major milestone in the development of the Prairie State Energy Campus when the state of Illinois issued an air permit for the electric generating station and coal mine campus. In January 2005, a group of Midwest rural electric cooperatives and municipal joint action agencies entered into definitive agreements to acquire 47% of the project. In February 2005, certain parties filed an appeal with the Environmental Appeals Board in Washington, D.C. challenging the air permit issued by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. The appeal must be resolved before construction of the project can begin. In October 2004, our Mustang Energy Project was awarded a $19.7 million Clean Coal Power Initiative Grant from the Department of Energy to demonstrate technology to achieve ultra low emissions. The plants are expected to be operational following a four year construction phase, which would begin when the company has completed all necessary permitting, selected partners, secured financing and sold the majority of the output of the plant. These plants will not be operational until at least 2010. Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to, and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Summary Our 2004 revenues of $3.63 billion was an increase of 29.0% over prior year, led by improved pricing and an industry record sales volume of 227.2 million tons. Mines acquired in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of sales and 11.0 million tons to our current year results. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the full year totaled $773.9 million, a 28.1% increase over $604.0 million in the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in the current year due to increased sales volumes and price. Net income in 2004 was $175.4 million, or $1.38 per share, an increase of 459.5% over 2003 net income of $31.3 million, or $0.29 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved operating results and acquisitions in 2004, and the impact in 2003 of $53.5 million in pretax early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes. 41 Table of Contents Revenues Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (dollars in thousands) Sales $ 3,545,027 $ 2,729,323 $ 815,704 29.9 % Other revenues 86,555 85,973 582 0.7 % Total revenues $ 3,631,582 $ 2,815,296 $ 816,286 29.0 % Revenues increased by 29.0%, or $816.3 million, over the prior year. The acquisition of three mines in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of total revenue and 11.0 million tons during the year. Excluding revenues from current year acquisitions, U.S. Mining revenues increased $375.4 million, and revenues from our brokerage operations increased $110.9 million on higher pricing and volume worldwide. Our average sales price per ton increased 14.6% during 2004 due to increased overall demand, which has driven pricing higher, most notably in Appalachia, and a change in sales mix. The sales mix has benefited from the increase in sales from the Australian segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets. In addition to geographic mix changes, our 2004 revenues included a greater proportion of higher priced metallurgical coal sales (our highest value product). Pricing of metallurgical coal has been responding to increased international demand for the product. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. Other revenues were relatively unchanged from prior year. In our Eastern U.S. Mining operations, revenues increased $302.8 million, or 25.3%, as a result of higher pricing and volumes from strong steam and metallurgical coal demand. Production increases at most eastern mines more than offset lower than expected production at certain of our mines and contract sources as a result of geologic difficulties, congestion related shipping delays and hurricane related production disruptions and delays. Appalachian revenues led the Eastern U.S. increase, benefiting the most from price increases while also increasing production and sales volumes. Revenues in Appalachia increased $188.1 million, or 37.0%, while in the Midwest, revenues increased by $114.7 million, or 16.6%. Revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $171.6 million, or 14.0% on both increased volumes and prices. However, the primary driver of increased revenues in the West was a 12.6 million ton increase in sales volume. Growth in volumes were primarily in the Powder River Basin operations, where revenues were up $58.6 million, or 7.5%, and from the addition of the Twentymile Mine in April which added $99.0 million to sales. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of stronger demand for the mines low sulfur product, which overcame difficulties with rail service, downtime at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine to upgrade the loading facility and poor weather, which impaired production early in the year. Revenues in our Australian Mining operations increased $241.5 million compared to 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of two operating mines during 2004 and benefiting from higher overall pricing for our products there. 42 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.9 million for the full year was $169.9 million higher than 2003 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $604.0 million, and was composed of the following: Increase (Decrease) to Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 402,131 $ 357,021 $ 45,110 12.6 % Eastern U.S. Mining 280,357 198,964 81,393 40.9 % Australian Mining 50,372 2,225 48,147 2163.9 % Trading and Brokerage 41,039 45,828 (4,789 ) (10.4 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,899 $ 604,038 $ 169,861 28.1 % Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.1 million during 2004, margin per ton increased $0.07, or 2.5%, while sales volume increased 12.6 million tons. The April 2004 acquisition of the Twentymile Mine contributed to $31.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA increase and sales volume, adding 6.2 million tons of the volume increase in 2004. An increase of $20.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA in the Powder River Basin, due primarily to increases in sales volume, contributed most of the remaining improvement in the West. Our Powder River Basin operations continued to benefit from strong demand, leading to record shipping levels which overcame the effects of a planned outage earlier in the year to increase throughput at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine, rail service problems throughout the year and the shutdown of our Big Sky Mine at the end of 2003. Results in the Southwest approximated prior year levels, as pricing improvements generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased $81.4 million, or 40.9%, compared to prior year due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.11, or 25.8%, and an increase in volume of 5.4 million tons, or 11.7%. Improved pricing led to increased margins in our Eastern operations, despite higher processing costs incurred to upgrade from steam to metallurgical quality, the cost of substitute coal purchases to enable production to be sold in higher value metallurgical coal markets, hurricane related transportation and production interruption and increased fuel and steel costs. Appalachia operations drove the improvement in the East with a $101.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Appalachia region benefited from strong demand driven pricing and volume and increased higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Our operations in Appalachia also benefited during the current year from $21.0 million in insurance recoveries and a $9.6 million increase in earnings from our equity interest in a joint venture, more than offsetting higher costs due to equipment and geologic difficulties at a mine in Kentucky. Adjusted EBITDA in the Midwest was $20.1 million less than prior year as increased production and sales, as well as higher overall sales prices, did not overcome poor geologic conditions at certain mines, higher equipment repair costs and higher fuel and steel costs. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $48.1 million in the current year. Our acquisition of two mines in April 2004 added 4.8 million tons and increased overall sales volume to 6.1 million tons. Most of the increase in sales tonnage was in higher margin metallurgical coal sales, driving a margin per ton increase of $6.55, or nearly 400%. The current year acquisitions contributed $43.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2004. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.8 million from the prior year primarily due to higher brokerage results in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA from trading activities increased over prior year due to improved pricing on our long position. 43 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,899 $ 604,038 $ 169,861 28.1 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (214,655 ) (193,760 ) (20,895 ) (10.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (270,159 ) (234,336 ) (35,823 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (42,387 ) (31,156 ) (11,231 ) (36.0 )% Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) (53,513 ) 51,762 96.7 % Interest expense (96,793 ) (98,540 ) 1,747 1.8 % Interest income 4,917 4,086 831 20.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ 153,071 $ (3,181 ) $ 156,252 n/a Total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.9 million for the current year is compared with $604.0 million from the prior year in the discussion above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, resource management and our Venezuelan mining operations. The increase in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to: net gains on asset sales were $8.8 million higher in the prior year. The prior year includes gains of $18.8 million on the sale of land, coal reserves and oil and gas rights, $6.4 million of other asset disposals, and $7.6 million from the sale of 1.15 million units of Penn Virginia Resource Partners LP (Penn Virginia), while the current year includes gains of only $8.0 million from other asset disposals and a $15.8 million gain from the sale of a total of 0.775 million units of Penn Virginia in two separate transactions; increased costs in 2004 for generation development ($5.3 million) related to the further development of the Prairie State and Thoroughbred Energy campuses; higher selling and administrative expenses of $34.5 million, primarily associated with higher long term incentive costs ($17.8 million), pensions, an increase in outside services costs (including costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the impact of current year acquisitions; and a $2.9 million increase in our accrual for future environmental obligations. These increased costs compared to prior year were partially offset by: lower costs ($29.0 million) in 2004 associated with past mining obligations, primarily lower retiree health care costs from the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and lower closed and suspended mine spending; contributions ($1.2 million) to Adjusted EBITDA from the December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $35.8 million during 2004 due to higher volume and acquisitions. Asset retirement obligation expense increased $11.2 million during the year due to increased or accelerated reclamation work at certain closed mine sites and the acquisition of additional mining operations during the year. 44 Table of Contents Debt extinguishment costs were $51.8 million higher in the prior year due to the significant prepayment premiums associated with the March 2003 refinancing, discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

The tax benefit recorded in 2004 differs from the benefit in 2003 primarily as a result of significantly higher pre tax income, partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion. The 2004 tax benefit also included a net $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on those net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) and alternative minimum tax credits. We evaluated and assessed the expected near term utilization of NOLs, book and taxable income trends, available tax strategies and the overall deferred tax position to determine the amount and timing of valuation allowance adjustments; a $2.8 million loss, net of tax, from discontinued operations in the current year due to costs to resolve a contract indemnification claim related to our former Citizens Power subsidiary; lower minority interests during 2004 due to the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million, relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the recession of EITF No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Summary In 2003, our revenues rose to $2.82 billion, a 3.5% increase over the prior year, led by industry record sales volume of 203.2 million tons. Our sales volume in the second half of 2003 was 8.6% stronger than the first half as generators completed upgrades to emission control equipment and increased coal consumption to meet growing industrial demand. 45 Table of Contents Our segment Adjusted EBITDA totaled $604.0 million for the full year, compared with $616.3 million in the prior year. Excluding $37.1 million in contract settlements from Western U.S. Minings 2002 results, segment Adjusted EBITDA improved $24.8 million. The improvement was due to higher Western U.S. Mining and Trading and Brokerage results, which more than offset a decrease in Eastern U.S. Mining Adjusted EBITDA results. Net income in 2003 totaled $31.3 million, or $0.29 per share, compared with $105.5 million, or $0.98 per share in 2002. The decrease in net income was due to higher asset retirement obligation costs resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 143, combined with $53.5 million in early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, both recorded in the first half of 2003. Revenues Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 2,729,323 $ 2,630,371 $ 98,952 3.8 % Other revenues 85,973 89,267 (3,294 ) (3.7 )% Total revenues $ 2,815,296 $ 2,719,638 $ 95,658 3.5 % Overall, our revenues increased 3.5% over the prior year. Sales increased 3.8% due to a 5.2% sales volume improvement in 2003. Volume from our brokerage operations increased substantially in 2003 due to improved domestic and export demand, and the inclusion of a full year of sales from the Australian mining operations (Wilkie Creek) acquired in August 2002 also contributed to the volume increase. In the West, revenues were essentially flat compared with the prior year, as record volumes due to strong second half demand in the Powder River Basin were offset by lower volumes in the Southwest as a result of customer outages due to major power plant repairs in the first half of the year. In the East, revenues declined 5.4% as slightly higher volumes in the Midwest to meet higher demand were more than offset by lower production in Appalachia due to poor weather in both the first and second quarters, and lower production at the Harris Mine and certain contract mines due to equipment and geologic difficulties. Midwest production overcame ramp up issues at the new Highland Mine and the Vermilion Grove portal of the Riola Mine. Overall, our average sales price decreased 1.4%, due to $27.7 million in sales recorded in 2002 as a result of a favorable arbitration ruling that resulted in a retroactive price adjustment to our Navajo station coal supply agreement, combined with a change in sales mix, as higher priced tons in the Appalachia and Midwest regions represented a lower percentage of our overall sales in 2003. On a regional basis, excluding the effect of the arbitration ruling in the prior year, in 2003 we realized comparable pricing in Appalachia, and improved pricing in the Southwest and Powder River Basin. Midwest prices decreased slightly from 2002 levels. 46 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $604.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $616.3 million for the full year 2002, broken down as follows: Increase (Decrease) Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 357,021 $ 356,392 $ 629 0.2 % Eastern U.S. Mining 198,964 219,940 (20,976 ) (9.5 )% Australian Mining 2,225 3,007 (782 ) (26.0 )% Trading and Brokerage 45,828 36,984 8,844 23.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 604,038 $ 616,323 $ (12,285 ) (2.0 )% Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $0.6 million in 2003. Excluding $37.1 million from 2002 results related to a favorable arbitration ruling and a mediated settlement, Western U.S. Mining Adjusted EBITDA improved $37.7 million, and our margin per ton improved $0.27, or 11%. The improvement was driven by our Powder River Basin operations, which realized improved pricing and record volume from strong demand for its products, combined with lower maintenance and repair costs, that overcame higher fuel and explosives costs. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern operations decreased $21.0 million (margin per ton decreased $0.27, or 6%) as a result of a $32.9 million decrease in contribution from our Appalachia operations, primarily due to lower production and higher costs at the Harris Mine, as a result of geologic difficulties, and equipment related operating difficulties at certain contract mines in 2003. This decrease was partially offset by a $12.0 million improvement in our Midwest operations results. The Midwest operations benefited from higher overall volume and improved pricing at our Black Beauty operations, which overcame higher fuel and explosives costs and ramp up issues at the new Vermilion Grove portal of the Riola Mine. Adjusted EBITDA from Trading and Brokerage operations increased $8.8 million over the prior year, primarily due to higher profit from improved brokerage volume and the impact of adopting EITF Issue 02 3, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Trading and Brokerage results in 2003 included $6.8 million in unrealized profit related to a contract restructuring wherein the new contracts terms and conditions required it to be classified as a derivative (and therefore marked to market). The unrealized profit related to this contract is expected to be converted to cash by the end of 2005. An additional $5.3 million of unrealized profit related to three other contract modifications, and the unrealized profit related to these contracts was converted to cash during 2004. 47 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 604,038 $ 616,323 $ (12,285 ) (2.0 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (193,760 ) (210,222 ) 16,462 7.8 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (234,336 ) (232,413 ) (1,923 ) (0.8 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (31,156 ) (31,156 ) n/a Early debt extinguishment costs (53,513 ) (53,513 ) n/a Interest expense (98,540 ) (102,458 ) 3,918 3.8 % Interest income 4,086 7,574 (3,488 ) (46.1 )% Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ (3,181 ) $ 78,804 $ (81,985 ) n/a Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $604.0 million for the full year, compared with $616.3 million in the prior year (discussed above). Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. In 2003, these results were impacted by: higher net gains on property disposals of $9.4 million; a $7.6 million gain in 2003 on the sale of 1.15 million units of Penn Virginia; higher selling and administrative expenses of $7.1 million associated with salaried pensions, incentive compensation, litigation, additional healthcare cost controls and Sarbanes Oxley compliance; and lower costs ($7.3 million) associated with past mining obligations, as the prior year included a $17.2 million charge related to an adverse U.S. Supreme Court decision which assigned us responsibility for the health care premiums of certain beneficiaries previously withdrawn by the Social Security Administration, while the current year included higher retiree healthcare costs of $8.9 million. Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests decreased $82.0 million from 2002, due to early debt extinguishment costs of $53.5 million incurred in 2003 pursuant to our refinancing (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements) and asset retirement obligation expense of $31.2 million recognized in 2003 in accordance with SFAS No. 143. Expense in 2002 related to reclamation activities was $11.0 million and was included in operating costs and expenses in the statement of operations. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Interest expense in 2003 decreased $3.9 million, due to $8.9 million in savings realized from our 2003 refinancing, partially offset by $5.0 million higher costs related to surety bonds and letters of credit used to secure our obligations for reclamation, workers compensation and lease commitments. Prior year interest income included $4.6 million in interest income received related to excise tax refunds. 48 Table of Contents Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ (3,181 ) $ 78,804 $ (81,985 ) n/a Income tax benefit 47,708 40,007 7,701 19.2 % Minority interests (3,035 ) (13,292 ) 10,257 77.2 % Income before accounting changes 41,492 105,519 (64,027 ) (60.7 )% Cumulative effect of accounting changes (10,144 ) (10,144 ) n/a Net income $ 31,348 $ 105,519 $ (74,171 ) (70.3 )% Net income decreased $74.2 million from 2002 due to the decrease in income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, combined with: a higher tax benefit of $7.7 million in 2003. The tax benefit recorded in 2003 differs from the tax expense in 2002 primarily as a result of the magnitude of the percentage depletion deduction (which is a permanent difference) relative to pre tax income, and a $10.0 million adjustment to our tax reserves; lower minority interests expense in 2003 due to the purchase of the remaining 25% of Arclar Coal Company in September 2002 and the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of EITF No. 98 10, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as there continues to be growth in the U.S., Chinese, Pacific Rim and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. Published indices also show improved year over year coal prices in most U.S. and global coal markets, and world wide coal supply/demand fundamentals remain tight due to market demand and transportation and production infrastructure limitations in most countries. Metallurgical coal is generally selling at a significant premium to steam coal. We expect our recently acquired Australian operations, which produce primarily metallurgical coal, to further enable us to capitalize on the strong global coal markets. In the United States, we expect coal demand to remain strong in 2005, assuming continued economic strength, normal weather, and available transportation for coal. Strong demand for coal and coal based electricity generation is being driven by the strengthening economy, low customer stockpiles, production difficulties for some producers, capacity constraints of nuclear generation and high prices of natural gas and oil. The high price of natural gas is leading coal fueled generating plants to operate at increasing levels. We expect that high costs and unpredictable supplies of oil and natural gas are likely to remain for the foreseeable future. Current average inventories at U.S. generators are estimated to be below five year averages and coal fueled electricity generation is expected to increase to record levels. Generation from nuclear power is currently constrained by capacity. We expect the Powder River Basin to remain the largest and fastest growing region in the United States for coal production due to its abundant coal reserves, low sulfur content and low mining costs. Year to year fluctuations in demand will occur based on weather and the strength of the economy. A 49 Table of Contents number of customers plan test burns and increased use of blending to reduce the supply/demand imbalance of Central Appalachian coals. Strong demand is also expected for coals from Colorado, the Midwest and Northern Appalachia. We are targeting 2005 production of 210 million to 220 million tons and total sales volume of 240 million to 250 million tons, including 12 to 14 million tons of metallurgical coal. Over 95% of our total production in 2005 has been priced (including 90% of our metallurgical coal production). Management expects strong market conditions and operating performance to overcome external cost pressures and adverse rail and port performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs. In addition, historically low interest rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities Our subsidiaries have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs, workers compensation obligations and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 for these liabilities totaled $146.0 million, while payments were $194.2 million, including a $50.0 million voluntary pre funding of one pension plan. Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injury and illness obligations. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. 50 Table of Contents Health care cost trend rate (dollars in thousands): One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 7,960 $ (5,462 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 138,793 $ (116,488 ) Discount rate (dollars in thousands): One Half One Half Percentage Point Percentage Point Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 987 $ (1,150 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (65,051 ) $ 71,496 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.43 years at December 31, 2004. Asset Retirement Obligations Our method for accounting for reclamation activities changed on January 1, 2003 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates related to surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. The asset retirement obligation is determined by mine and we use various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the revisions to the obligation and asset are recognized at the appropriate credit adjusted risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $42.4 million, and payments totaled $45.8 million. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal in over the counter markets. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal and emission allowance positions. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Ninety nine percent of the contracts in our trading portfolio as of December 31, 2004 were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials, and one percent of our contracts were valued based on similar market transactions. As of December 31, 2004, one hundred percent of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2005. 51 Table of Contents Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future book and taxable income trends, available tax planning strategies and the overall deferred tax position. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest, as considered appropriate by management. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 98% of our revenue in 2004 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these agreements, risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and debt and equity offerings related to significant transactions. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs, costs related to past mining obligations and planned acquisitions and development activities. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above, in excess of the primary uses. We typically fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations, and during 2004 and 2003 have had no borrowings outstanding under our $900.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which we use primarily for standby letters of credit. This provides us with available borrowing capacity ($554.1 million as of December 31, 2004) to use to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs. Operating activities provided $283.8 million of cash in 2004, an increase of $94.9 million compared with prior year. A $136.7 million increase in net income from continuing operations was the primary contributor to the improvement. Partially offsetting this increase was higher pension plan funding of 52 Table of Contents $44.6 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we electively funded $50.0 million to one pension plan, the remaining $12.1 million of current year pension funding was toward minimum funding obligations for our pension plans. By contrast, contributions were $17.5 million in the prior year, $9.9 million of which was voluntary. Net cash used in investing activities was $705.0 million in 2004, $512.8 million more than prior year. Investment spending in 2004 includes $421.3 million for the acquisition of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado and two mines in Australia. In the prior year, we spent $90.0 million to acquire the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company. Capital spending of $266.6 million in the current year was $110.2 million more than prior year expenditures of $156.4 million. Current year spending included a large loading facility upgrade in our Powder River Basin operations, $114.7 million of initial payments related to the successful acquisition of a total of 621 million tons of Powder River Basin coal reserves, and equipment purchases in the Midwest and at Australian mines acquired during 2004. In December 2004, we acquired a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and manages the Paso Diablo mine in Venezuela, for a net purchase price of $32.5 million. Proceeds from property and equipment disposals were $30.2 million lower than prior year primarily due to the sale of oil and gas rights, land and coal reserves and surplus surface land in Appalachia in 2003, with no comparable transactions in 2004. Financing activities provided $693.4 million in 2004 compared with $48.6 million in the prior year, an increase of $644.8 million. The current year included net proceeds from our March 2004 debt and equity offerings of $627.8 million. We issued 17.65 million common shares at $22.50 per share, raising $383.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses, and $250 million from our issuance of 5.875% Senior Notes due in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed a repricing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of an amended $450 million Term Loan and a $900 million Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of the repricing, the previous term loan was extinguished and a new loan with nearly identical terms, but a lower interest rate, was issued. The previous Term Loan had been repriced during the first quarter of 2004 concurrent with a $300 million increase in capacity of the revolving loan. Additional payments on long term debt in 2004 were $36.3 million. During the first half of 2003, we refinanced our debt utilizing proceeds from long term debt of $1.1 billion to, among other things, repay line of credit borrowings of $121.6 million and long term debt of $831.0 million and to pay $23.7 million in debt issuance costs in connection with the new debt issued. The prior year included other debt repayments of $37.4 million. Securitized interest in accounts receivable increased $110.0 million in 2004 compared to a decrease of $46.4 million in the prior year. Financing cash flows in the current and prior year periods included dividends of $32.6 million and $24.1 million, respectively. A detailed discussion of our debt instruments and refinancing activity is included in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our total indebtedness consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2004 2003 Term Loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility $ 448,750 $ 446,625 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 239,525 Fair value of interest rate swaps 6.875% Senior Notes 5,189 4,239 5.0% Subordinated Notes 73,621 79,412 Other 7,880 16,263 Total $ 1,424,965 $ 1,196,539 We filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in October 2003, which was declared effective in March 2004, allowing us to offer and sell from time to time 53 Table of Contents unsecured debt securities consisting of notes, debentures, and other debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants; and or units totaling a maximum of $1.25 billion. The 2004 debt and equity offerings noted above were made under this universal shelf registration statement, which remains in effect. The shelf registration statement has a remaining capacity of $602.9 million. Related proceeds could be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of other debt, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions and any other purposes that may be stated in any prospectus supplement. As of December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We had letters of credit outstanding under the facility of $345.9 million, leaving $554.1 million available for borrowing. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, and the 5.0% Subordinated Notes as of December 31, 2004. In May 2003, we entered into and designated four interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $100.0 million as a fair value hedge of our 6.875% Senior Notes. Under the swaps, we pay a floating rate that resets each March 15 and September 15, based upon the six month LIBOR rate, for a period of ten years ending March 15, 2013 and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The average applicable floating rate of the four swaps was 5.14% as of December 31, 2004. At current LIBOR levels, we would realize annualized savings of approximately $1.7 million over the term of the swaps. In September 2003, we entered into two $400.0 million interest rate swaps. One $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2010, was designated as a hedge of changes in expected cash flows on the term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under this swap we pay a fixed rate of 6.764% and receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% (4.99% at December 31, 2004) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate. Another $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2013, was designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Under this swap, we pay a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.97% (4.46% at December 31, 2004) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The swaps will lower our overall borrowing costs on $400.0 million of debt principal by 0.64% over the term of the floating to fixed swap. This results in annual interest savings of $2.6 million over the term of the fixed to floating swap. The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 900,000 $ 900,000 In October 2004, our board of directors approved a 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend on common stock, to $0.075 per share. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Year Within After 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 95,126 $ 243,516 $ 460,966 $ 1,234,582 Capital lease obligations 892 790 38 Operating leases obligations 92,817 138,097 69,960 49,417 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 141,822 5,677 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 79,035 274,562 207,656 52,996 Other long term liabilities(2) 172,582 344,892 355,376 908,744 Total contractual cash obligations $ 582,274 $ 1,007,534 $ 1,093,996 $ 2,245,739 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We had $147.5 million of purchase obligations related to future capital expenditures at December 31, 2004. Commitments for coal reserve related expenditures, including Federal Coal Leases, are included in Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations in the table above. The contractual commitments detailed in the table above do not include expenditures related to the Federal Coal Lease bid that was won in February 2005 and the related tons are not included in our reserves. Total capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to range from $450 million to $500 million. Approximately 50% of projected 2005 capital expenditures relates to the Federal Coal Leases and longwall equipment at the Twentymile Mine and longwall replacement components in Australia, and the remainder is expected be used to purchase or develop reserves, replace or add equipment, fund cost reduction initiatives and upgrade equipment and facilities at the operations we recently acquired. We anticipate funding these capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related and reclamation liabilities included above are expected to be funded from operating cash flow, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases and coal reserves. We believe the risk of generating lower than anticipated operating cash flow in 2005 is reduced by our high level of sales commitments (over 95% of 2005 planned production), improved pricing and ongoing efforts to improve our operating cost structure. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. 55 Table of Contents We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in millions): Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total Self Bonding $ 653.3 $ $ $ $ $ 653.3 Surety Bonds 294.5 134.3 91.7 27.6 548.1 Letters of Credit 0.4 25.1 72.9 120.1 130.7 349.2 $ 948.2 $ 159.4 $ 164.6 $ 120.1 $ 158.3 $ 1,550.6 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and collateral for surety companies. We have guaranteed $9.2 million of debt of an affiliate in which we have a 49% equity investment, as described in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Our remaining guarantees and indemnifications are discussed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. In March 2000, we established an accounts receivable securitization program. Under the program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to the Seller are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We used proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable in lieu of drawing down on our revolving credit facility or to repay long term debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. On September 16, 2004, we and our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary closed on an expansion of the accounts receivable securitization facility. Under the terms of the amended agreement, the total facility capacity was increased from $140 million to $225 million and the receivables of additional wholly owned subsidiaries of ours are now eligible to participate in the facility. The maturity of the facility was also extended to September 2009. All other terms and conditions remain substantially unchanged. The funding cost of the securitization program was $1.7 million and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, the securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from our consolidated balance sheet. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit were $200.0 million and $90.0 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A detailed description of our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization is included in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS No. 123(R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005 (for calendar year companies), and we expect to adopt the standard on that date, using one of the two methods permitted by SFAS No. 123(R), described below: A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments 56 Table of Contents granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. Had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The precise impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on us in 2005 and beyond cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of equity based compensation granted in the future. However, because we make our annual equity based compensation grants in January, prior to the issuance of our financial statements, an estimate of the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on 2005 net income can be made. Based on stock option grants made in January 2005, considering option grants outstanding in 2005 made prior to 2005, and assuming no additional stock option grants in 2005 beyond January 2005, we anticipate (assuming the modified prospective method is used) recognizing expense for stock options for the period from July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 of $2.3 million, net of taxes. It should be noted that annual equity based compensation grants in years prior to 2005 consisted of a higher number of stock options than the grant made in 2005. For the January 2005 grant, we delivered comparable equity based compensation value by granting a combination of stock options and restricted stock. Prior to January 2005, we had not previously granted restricted stock as part of our annual compensation strategy. Expense related to restricted stock (which vests over five years, and assuming no grants beyond January 2005) is anticipated to be approximately $0.8 million, net of taxes, in 2005. Risks Relating to Our Company If a substantial portion of our long term coal supply agreements terminate, our revenues and operating profits could suffer if we were unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms to those in our contracts. A substantial portion of our sales is made under coal supply agreements, which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations. The execution of a satisfactory coal supply agreement is frequently the basis on which we undertake the development of coal reserves required to be supplied under the contract. For the year ended December 31, 2004, 90% of our sales volume was sold under long term coal supply agreements. At December 31, 2004, our coal supply agreements had remaining terms ranging from one to 17 years and an average volume weighted remaining term of approximately 3.4 years. Many of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price upward or downward at specified times. We may adjust these contract prices based on inflation or deflation and or changes in the factors affecting the cost of producing coal, such as taxes, fees, royalties and changes in the laws regulating the mining, production, sale or use of coal. In a limited number of contracts, failure of the parties to agree on a price under those provisions may allow either party to terminate the contract. We sometimes experience a reduction in coal prices in new long term coal supply agreements replacing some of our expiring contracts. Coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party. Most coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as Btu, sulfur content, ash content, grindability and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications 57 Table of Contents could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts. Moreover, some of these agreements permit the customer to terminate the contract if transportation costs, which our customers typically bear, increase substantially. In addition, some of these contracts allow our customers to terminate their contracts in the event of changes in regulations affecting our industry that increase the price of coal beyond specified limits. The operating profits we realize from coal sold under supply agreements depend on a variety of factors. In addition, price adjustment and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility provided by those contracts. If a substantial portion of our coal supply agreements were modified or terminated, we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to find alternate buyers for our coal at the same level of profitability. Market prices for coal decreased in most regions in 2002. In 2003, pricing improved for eastern coal regions and moved slightly higher for western coal regions, and in 2004 pricing was substantially higher for the eastern coal regions and slightly higher for western coal regions. As a result, we cannot predict the future strength of the coal market and cannot assure you that we will be able to replace existing long term coal supply agreements at the same prices or with similar profit margins when they expire. In addition, two of our largest coal supply agreements are the subject of ongoing litigation and arbitration. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we derived 25% of our total coal revenues from sales to our five largest customers. At December 31, 2004, we had 45 coal supply agreements with these customers expiring at various times from 2005 to 2011. We are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long term agreements with some of these customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and those customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long term coal supply agreements. If a number of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially. Peabody Western has a long term coal supply agreement with the owners of the Mohave Generating Station that expires on December 31, 2005. Southern California Edison (the majority owner and operator of the plant) is involved in a California Public Utilities Commission proceeding related to the operation of the Mohave plant beyond 2005 or the temporary or permanent shutdown of the plant. In a July 2003 filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, the operator affirmed that the Mohave plant was not forecast to return to service as a coal fueled resource until mid 2009 at the earliest if the plant is shutdown at December 31, 2005. Southern California Edison has subsequently reaffirmed this forecast to the Commission. On December 2, 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission issued an opinion authorizing Southern California Edison to make necessary expenditures at the Mohave plant to preserve the Mohave open option while Southern California Edison continues to seek resolution of the water and coal issues. The opinion stated that its goal was to return the Mohave plant to service with as short of a shut down period as possible. There is a dispute with the Hopi Tribe regarding the use of groundwater in the transportation of the coal by pipeline from Peabody Westerns Black Mesa Mine to the Mohave plant. As a part of the alternate dispute resolution referenced in the Navajo Nation litigation, Peabody Western has been negotiating with the owners of the Mohave Generating Station and the Navajo Generating Station, and the two tribes to resolve the complex issues surrounding the groundwater dispute and other disputes involving the two generating stations. Resolution of these issues is critical to the continuation of the operation of the Mohave Generating Station and the renewal of the coal supply agreement after December 31, 2005. There is no assurance that the issues critical to the continued operation of the Mohave plant will be resolved. If these issues are not resolved in a timely manner, the operation of the Mohave plant will cease or be suspended on December 31, 2005. Absent a satisfactory alternate dispute resolution, it is unlikely that the coal supply agreement for the Mohave plant will be renewed in time to avoid a shutdown of the mine in 2006. The Mohave plant is the sole customer of the Black Mesa Mine, 58 Table of Contents which sold 4.7 million tons in 2004. In 2004, the mine generated $25.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA, which represents 4.5% of our total of $559.2 million. Our financial performance could be adversely affected by our substantial debt. Our financial performance could be affected by our substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2004, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,425.0 million, and we had $554.1 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to: making it more difficult for us to pay interest and satisfy our debt obligations; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate uses; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the coal industry; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors. In addition, our indebtedness subjects us to financial and other restrictive covenants. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets secure our indebtedness under our credit facility. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of sufficient operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The credit facility and the indenture governing the notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If transportation for our coal becomes unavailable or uneconomic for our customers, our ability to sell coal could suffer. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customers purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy or could make some of our operations less competitive than other sources of coal. Certain coal supply agreements, which account for less than 5% of our tons sold, permit the customer to terminate the contract if the cost of transportation increases by an amount ranging from 10% to 20% in any given 12 month period. Coal producers depend upon rail, barge, trucking, overland conveyor, pipeline and ocean going vessels to deliver coal to markets. While our coal customers typically arrange and pay for transportation of coal from the mine or port to the point of use, disruption of these transportation services because of weather related problems, strikes, lock outs, transportation delays or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers and thus could adversely affect our results of operations. For 59 Table of Contents example, the high volume of coal shipped from all Powder River Basin mines could create temporary congestion on the rail systems servicing that region. Continued increases in coal demand, combined with many customers inventories that are lower than historical averages, created periodic regional rail and port congestion in 2004. To the extent rail or port congestion constrains our operations ability to successfully ship coal to our customers, our operating results will be reduced. Risks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating our business. Our mining operations are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include weather and natural disasters, unexpected maintenance problems, key equipment failures, variations in coal seam thickness, variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the coal deposit, variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geologic conditions. Our mining operations are extensively regulated, which imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal. Federal, state and local authorities regulate the coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. In addition, significant legislation mandating specified benefits for retired coal miners affects our industry. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment. The costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production. The possibility exists that new legislation and or regulations and orders may be adopted that may materially adversely affect our mining operations, our cost structure and or our customers ability to use coal. New legislation or administrative regulations (or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations), including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. The majority of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchasers plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use. These factors and legislation, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the United States and over 160 other nations are signatories to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is intended to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. In December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, the signatories to the convention established a binding set of emission targets for developed nations, which took effect in February 2005. Although the specific emission targets vary from country to country, the United States would be required to reduce emissions to 93% of 1990 levels over a five year budget period from 2008 through 2012. Although the United States has not ratified the emission targets and no comprehensive regulations focusing on greenhouse gas emissions are in place, these restrictions, whether through ratification of the emission targets or other efforts to stabilize or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, could adversely affect the price and demand for coal. According to the Department of Energys Energy Information Administration Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2003, coal accounts for 31% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions could result in reduced use of coal if electricity generators switch to lower carbon sources of fuel. Further developments in connection with regulations or other limits on carbon dioxide emissions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 60 Table of Contents Our expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. We provide postretirement health and life insurance benefits to eligible union and non union employees. We calculated the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, which we estimate had a present value of $1,020.8 million as of December 31, 2004, $81.3 million of which was a current liability. We have estimated these unfunded obligations based on assumptions described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits. We are party to an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or the PBGC, and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make specified contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States). As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries participate in two defined benefit multi employer pension funds that were established as a result of collective bargaining with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) pursuant to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement as periodically negotiated. The UMWA 1950 Pension Plan provides pension and disability pension benefits to qualifying represented employees retiring from a participating employer where the employee last worked prior to January 1, 1976. This is a closed group of beneficiaries with no new entrants. The UMWA 1974 Pension Plan provides pension and disability pension benefits to qualifying represented employees retiring from a participating employer where the employee last worked after December 31, 1975. Contributions to these funds could increase as a result of future collective bargaining with the United Mine Workers of America, a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency of other coal companies who currently contribute to these funds, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, higher medical and drug costs or other funding deficiencies. The United Mine Workers of America Combined Fund was created by federal law in 1992. This multi employer fund provides health care benefits to a closed group of our retired former employees who last worked prior to 1976, as well as orphaned beneficiaries of out of business companies who were receiving benefits as orphans prior to the 1992 law; no new retirees will be added to this group. The liability is subject to increases or decreases in per capita health care costs, offset by the mortality curve in this aging population of beneficiaries. Another fund, the 1992 Benefit Plan also created by the same federal law in 1992 provides benefits to qualifying retired former employees of companies who have gone out of business and have defaulted in providing their former employees with retiree medical benefits. Beneficiaries continue to be added to this fund as employers go out of business, but the overall exposure for new beneficiaries into this fund is limited to retirees covered under their employers plan who retired prior to October 1, 1994. Another fund, the 1993 Benefit Fund was established through collective bargaining and provides retiree medical benefits to qualifying retired former employees who retired after September 30, 1994 of certain signatory companies who have gone out of business and have defaulted in providing their former employees with retiree medical benefits. Beneficiaries continue to be added to this fund as employers go out of business. 61 Table of Contents Based upon the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, we assumed future cash savings which allowed us to reduce our projected post retirement benefit obligations and related expense. Failure to achieve these assumed future savings under all benefit plans could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our future success depends upon our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves that are economically recoverable. Our recoverable reserves decline as we produce coal. We have not yet applied for the permits required or developed the mines necessary to use all of our reserves. Furthermore, we may not be able to mine all of our reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations. Our future success depends upon our conducting successful exploration and development activities or acquiring properties containing economically recoverable reserves. Our current strategy includes increasing our reserves through acquisitions of government and other leases and producing properties and continuing to use our existing properties. The federal government also leases natural gas and coalbed methane reserves in the West, including in the Powder River Basin. Some of these natural gas and coalbed methane reserves are located on, or adjacent to, some of our Powder River Basin reserves, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and lessees of those interests. Other lessees rights relating to these mineral interests could prevent, delay or increase the cost of developing our coal reserves. These lessees may also seek damages from us based on claims that our coal mining operations impair their interests. Additionally, the federal government limits the amount of federal land that may be leased by any company to 150,000 acres nationwide. As of December 31, 2004, we leased a total of 60,140 acres from the federal government and added an additional 17,598 through February 2005. The limit could restrict our ability to lease additional federal lands. For additional discussion of our federal leases see Item 2. Properties of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our planned mine development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have continuing success developing additional mines. Most of our mining operations are conducted on properties owned or leased by us. Because title to most of our leased properties and mineral rights are not thoroughly verified until a permit to mine the property is obtained, our right to mine some of our reserves may be materially adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist. In addition, in order to develop our reserves, we must receive various governmental permits. We cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the permits necessary for us to operate profitably in the future. We may not be able to negotiate new leases from the government or from private parties or obtain mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interest in properties on which mining operations are not commenced during the term of the lease. From time to time, we have experienced litigation with lessors of our coal properties and with royalty holders. A decrease in the production of our metallurgical coal (or other high margin products) or a decrease in the price of metallurgical coal (or other high margin products) could decrease our anticipated profitability. We more than doubled our sales of metallurgical coal in 2004, primarily as a result of the acquisition of coal operations in Australia in April 2004. Our current annual capacity for metallurgical coal production is approximately 12 to 14 million tons. Prices for metallurgical coal in late 2004 and early 2005 have reached historically high levels. We have committed 90% of our projected 2005 metallurgical coal production at significantly higher prices than in the past. As a result, our projected margins from these sales have increased significantly, and will represent a larger percentage of our overall revenues and profits in 2005. To the extent we experience either production or transportation difficulties that impair our ability to ship metallurgical coal to our customers at anticipated levels, our profitability will be reduced in 2005. After 2005, we have metallurgical coal production that has not yet been priced. As a result, a decrease in metallurgical coal prices could decrease our profitability beyond 2005. 62 Table of Contents An inability of contract miner or brokerage sources to fulfill the delivery terms of their contracts with us could reduce our profitability. In conducting our trading, brokerage and mining operations, we utilize third party sources of coal production, including contract miners and brokerage sources, to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements. Our profitability or exposure to loss on transactions or relationships such as these is dependent upon the reliability (including financial viability) and price of the third party supply, our obligation to supply coal to customers in the event that adverse geologic mining conditions restrict deliveries from our suppliers, our willingness to participate in temporary cost increases experienced by our third party coal suppliers, our ability to pass on temporary cost increases to our customers, the ability to substitute, when economical, third party coal sources with internal production or coal purchased in the market, and other factors. If the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future, our profitability could be impaired. During the mid 1970s and early 1980s, a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry, spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry, all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices. Similarly, continued increases in future coal prices could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers. Any overcapacity could reduce coal prices in the future. We could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations. As of December 31, 2004, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 7,900 employees. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 40% of our hourly employees were represented by unions and they generated 21% of our 2004 coal production. Relations with our employees, and where applicable, organized labor, are important to our success. United States The United Mine Workers of America represented approximately 30% of our hourly employees, who generated 16% of our production during the year ended December 31, 2004. An additional 6% of our hourly employees are represented by labor unions other than the United Mine Workers of America. These employees generated 2% of our production during the year ended December 31, 2004. Hourly workers at our mines in Arizona and one of our mines in Colorado are represented by the United Mine Workers of America under the Western Surface Agreement, which was ratified in 2000 and is effective through September 1, 2005. Our union labor east of the Mississippi River is primarily represented by the United Mine Workers of America and the majority of union mines are subject to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement. The current five year labor agreement was ratified in December 2001 and is effective through December 31, 2006. Australia The Australian coal mining industry is highly unionized and the majority of workers employed at our Australian Mining Operations are members of trade unions. These employees are represented by three unions: the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), which represents the production employees, and two unions that represent the other staff. Our Australian employees are approximately 4% of our entire workforce and generated 3% of our total production in the year ended December 31, 2004. The miners at Wilkie Creek operate under a labor agreement that expires in June 2006. The miners at Burton operate under a labor agreement that is currently under negotiation. The miners at North Goonyella operate under a labor agreement which expires in March 2008. The miners at Eaglefield operate under a labor agreement that expires in May 2007. 63 Table of Contents Because of the higher labor costs and the increased risk of strikes and other work related stoppages that may be associated with union operations in the coal industry, our competitors who operate without union labor may have a competitive advantage in areas where they compete with our unionized operations. If some or all of our current non union operations were to become unionized, we could incur an increased risk of work stoppages, reduced productivity and higher labor costs. The 10 month United Mine Workers of America strike in 1993 had a material adverse effect on us. Our operations could be adversely affected if we fail to appropriately secure our obligations. U.S. federal and state laws and Australian laws require us to secure certain of our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers compensation, to secure coal lease obligations and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. The primary method for us to meet those obligations is to post a corporate guarantee (i.e. self bond) or to provide a third party surety bond. As of December 31, 2004, we had $653.3 million of self bonds in place for our reclamation obligations. As of December 31, 2004, we also had outstanding surety bonds with third parties for post mining reclamation totaling $294.5 million. We had an additional $91.7 million of surety bonds in place for workers compensation obligations and $134.3 million of surety bonds securing coal leases. All other bonding, including performance and infrastructure bonds, totaled $27.6 million. These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. It has become increasingly difficult for us to secure new surety bonds or renew bonds without the posting of partial collateral. Surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or to provide a suitable alternatives would have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including the following: lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds; restrictions on the availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of our indenture or new credit facility; and the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety. Our ability to self bond reduces our costs of providing financial assurances. To the extent we are unable to maintain our current level of self bonding, due to legislative or regulatory changes or changes in our financial condition, our costs would increase. Our ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or fail to attract qualified personnel. We manage our business with a number of key personnel, the loss of a number of whom could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, as our business develops and expands, we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. We do not have key person life insurance to cover our executive officers. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending, and market liquidity, which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control, such as terrorist attacks and acts of war. Future terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions affecting our customers may materially adversely affect our operations. As a result, there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to 64 Table of Contents our customers, decreased sales of our coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from our customers. Strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the United States. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government imposed price controls. It is possible that any, or a combination, of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness deteriorates. Our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. Our customer base is changing with deregulation as utilities sell their power plants to their non regulated affiliates or third parties. These new power plant owners or other customers may have credit ratings that are below investment grade. If deterioration of the creditworthiness of our customers occurs, our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected. Our certificate of incorporation and by laws include provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our by laws and certificate of incorporation impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of the stockholders rights plan adopted by our board of directors. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal trading, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes, and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options, and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps at December 31, 2004 and included forwards, futures and options at December 31, 2003. Our policy for accounting for coal trading activities is described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation 65 Table of Contents period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both option and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.5 million, $6.1 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.4 million, $3.2 million, and $1.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, one hundred percent of the value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2005. We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. In the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2005 involves hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2004, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flows hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling $515.0 million of which $285.0 million, $170.0 million and $60.0 million will expire in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Our current expectation for 2005 non capital, Australian dollar denominated cash expenditures is approximately $600 million. A change in the Australian dollar/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of US$0.01 66 Table of Contents (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of $6.0 million per year. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2004, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $872.9 million of fixed rate borrowings and $552.1 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $5.5 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $60.7 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2004 and 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we had sales commitments for over 95% of our 2005 production, leaving 5 to 10 million tons unpriced. Also as of December 31, 2005, we had 65 to 75 million tons and 130 to 140 million tons of expected production available for sale or repricing at market prices for 2006 and 2007, respectively. We have an annual metallurgical coal production capacity of 12 to 14 million tons, all of which is priced for 2005 and none of which is priced beyond March 2006. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. In addition, we utilize derivative contracts to hedge our commodity price exposure. As of December 31, 2004, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel. Notional amounts outstanding under these contracts, scheduled to expire through 2007, were 76.7 million gallons of heating oil and 28.7 million gallons of crude oil. Overall, we have fixed prices for approximately 90% of our anticipated diesel fuel requirements in 2005. We expect to consume approximately 95 million gallons of fuel per year. Based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of approximately $1 million per year. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2004, our equity in earnings of affiliates and all gains on asset disposals were classified separately as a component of operating income. Prior periods have been restated to conform with current presentation. On April 15 2004, we acquired three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the results of operations of the two mines in Queensland, Australia and the results of operations of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado from the April 15, 2004 purchase date. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 include early debt extinguishment costs of $53.5 million pursuant to our debt refinancing in the first half of 2003. In addition, results included expense relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of EITF No. 98 10. These accounting changes are further discussed in Note 6 to our financial statements. In July 2001, we changed our fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31. The change was first effective with respect to the nine months ended December 31, 2001. On May 22, 2001, concurrent with our initial public offering, we converted our Class A common stock and Class B common stock into a single class of common stock, all on a one for one basis. 37 Table of Contents Results of operations for the year ended March 31, 2001 included a $171.7 million pretax gain on the sale of our Peabody Resources Limited operations in Australia. Capital expenditures of $151.4 million for this period do not include Peabody Resources Limited capital expenditures. In anticipation of the sale of Citizens Power, which occurred in August 2000, we classified Citizens Power as a discontinued operation as of March 31, 2000. Results in 2004 include a $2.8 million loss, net of taxes, from discontinued operations related to the settlement of a Citizens Power indemnification claim. Citizens Power is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. We have derived the selected historical financial data for the years ended and as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the nine months ended and as of December 31, 2001, and for the year ended and as of March 31, 2001 from our audited financial statements. All share and per share amounts included in the following consolidated financial data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a two for one stock split, effective March 30, 2005. You should read the following table in conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements, and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of operations for the historical periods included in the following table are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods. In addition, the Risks Relating To Our Company section of Item 7 of this report includes a discussion of risk factors that could impact our future results of operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 32 active coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions and internationally in Australia. In 2004, we sold 227.2 million tons of coal that accounted for an estimated 20% of all U.S. coal sales, and were more than 85% greater than the sales of our closest competitor. The Energy Information Administration estimates that 1.1 billion tons of coal were consumed in the United States in 2004 and expects domestic consumption of coal by electricity generators to grow at a rate of 1.6% per year through 2025. Coal fueled generation is used in most cases to meet baseload electricity requirements, and coal use generally grows at the pace of electricity growth. In 2004, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 52%, which was more than all other fuels used to generate electricity combined. Our primary customers are U.S. utilities, which accounted for 90% of our sales in 2004. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2004, approximately 90% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2004, we had priced more than 95% of our expected 2005 production. As discussed more fully in Risks Relating to Our Company, our results of operations in the near term can be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Eastern U.S. Mining, Western U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Appalachia and Midwest operations, and our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. The principal business of the Western U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. The principal business of the Eastern U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities, as well as the mining of some metallurgical coal, sold to steel and coke producers. Geologically, Eastern operations mine bituminous and Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Our Australian Mining operations consist of our Wilkie Creek Mine, two additional mines acquired in April 2004, Burton and North Goonyella, and our recently opened Eaglefield Mine, which is a surface operation adjacent to, and fulfilling contract tonnages in conjunction with, the North Goonyella underground mine. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining low sulfur, high Btu coal sold to an international customer base. Primarily metallurgical coal is produced from our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 4% of our total sales volume and approximately 3% of U.S. sales volume. In December 2004, we purchased a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 7 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. Each of our mining operations is described in Item 1 of this report. 40 Table of Contents In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 87% of revenues in 2004, we also generate revenues from brokering and trading coal (12% of revenues), and by creating value from our vast natural resource position by selling non core land holdings and mineral interests to generate additional cash flows. We are developing coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. These projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Three projects are currently being evaluated the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, the 1,500 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in Washington County, Illinois and the 300 megawatt Mustang Energy Project near Grants, N.M. During 2004, one of our subsidiaries and Fluor Daniel Illinois, Inc. signed a letter of intent for engineering, design and construction of Prairie States power related facilities. In January 2005, we achieved a major milestone in the development of the Prairie State Energy Campus when the state of Illinois issued an air permit for the electric generating station and coal mine campus. In January 2005, a group of Midwest rural electric cooperatives and municipal joint action agencies entered into definitive agreements to acquire 47% of the project. In February 2005, certain parties filed an appeal with the Environmental Appeals Board in Washington, D.C. challenging the air permit issued by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. The appeal must be resolved before construction of the project can begin. In October 2004, our Mustang Energy Project was awarded a $19.7 million Clean Coal Power Initiative Grant from the Department of Energy to demonstrate technology to achieve ultra low emissions. The plants are expected to be operational following a four year construction phase, which would begin when the company has completed all necessary permitting, selected partners, secured financing and sold the majority of the output of the plant. These plants will not be operational until at least 2010. Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to, and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Summary Our 2004 revenues of $3.63 billion was an increase of 29.0% over prior year, led by improved pricing and an industry record sales volume of 227.2 million tons. Mines acquired in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of sales and 11.0 million tons to our current year results. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the full year totaled $773.9 million, a 28.1% increase over $604.0 million in the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in the current year due to increased sales volumes and price. Net income in 2004 was $175.4 million, or $1.38 per share, an increase of 459.5% over 2003 net income of $31.3 million, or $0.29 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved operating results and acquisitions in 2004, and the impact in 2003 of $53.5 million in pretax early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes. 41 Table of Contents Revenues Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (dollars in thousands) Sales $ 3,545,027 $ 2,729,323 $ 815,704 29.9 % Other revenues 86,555 85,973 582 0.7 % Total revenues $ 3,631,582 $ 2,815,296 $ 816,286 29.0 % Revenues increased by 29.0%, or $816.3 million, over the prior year. The acquisition of three mines in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of total revenue and 11.0 million tons during the year. Excluding revenues from current year acquisitions, U.S. Mining revenues increased $375.4 million, and revenues from our brokerage operations increased $110.9 million on higher pricing and volume worldwide. Our average sales price per ton increased 14.6% during 2004 due to increased overall demand, which has driven pricing higher, most notably in Appalachia, and a change in sales mix. The sales mix has benefited from the increase in sales from the Australian segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets. In addition to geographic mix changes, our 2004 revenues included a greater proportion of higher priced metallurgical coal sales (our highest value product). Pricing of metallurgical coal has been responding to increased international demand for the product. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. Other revenues were relatively unchanged from prior year. In our Eastern U.S. Mining operations, revenues increased $302.8 million, or 25.3%, as a result of higher pricing and volumes from strong steam and metallurgical coal demand. Production increases at most eastern mines more than offset lower than expected production at certain of our mines and contract sources as a result of geologic difficulties, congestion related shipping delays and hurricane related production disruptions and delays. Appalachian revenues led the Eastern U.S. increase, benefiting the most from price increases while also increasing production and sales volumes. Revenues in Appalachia increased $188.1 million, or 37.0%, while in the Midwest, revenues increased by $114.7 million, or 16.6%. Revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $171.6 million, or 14.0% on both increased volumes and prices. However, the primary driver of increased revenues in the West was a 12.6 million ton increase in sales volume. Growth in volumes were primarily in the Powder River Basin operations, where revenues were up $58.6 million, or 7.5%, and from the addition of the Twentymile Mine in April which added $99.0 million to sales. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of stronger demand for the mines low sulfur product, which overcame difficulties with rail service, downtime at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine to upgrade the loading facility and poor weather, which impaired production early in the year. Revenues in our Australian Mining operations increased $241.5 million compared to 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of two operating mines during 2004 and benefiting from higher overall pricing for our products there. 42 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.9 million for the full year was $169.9 million higher than 2003 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $604.0 million, and was composed of the following: Increase (Decrease) to Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 402,131 $ 357,021 $ 45,110 12.6 % Eastern U.S. Mining 280,357 198,964 81,393 40.9 % Australian Mining 50,372 2,225 48,147 2163.9 % Trading and Brokerage 41,039 45,828 (4,789 ) (10.4 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,899 $ 604,038 $ 169,861 28.1 % Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.1 million during 2004, margin per ton increased $0.07, or 2.5%, while sales volume increased 12.6 million tons. The April 2004 acquisition of the Twentymile Mine contributed to $31.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA increase and sales volume, adding 6.2 million tons of the volume increase in 2004. An increase of $20.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA in the Powder River Basin, due primarily to increases in sales volume, contributed most of the remaining improvement in the West. Our Powder River Basin operations continued to benefit from strong demand, leading to record shipping levels which overcame the effects of a planned outage earlier in the year to increase throughput at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine, rail service problems throughout the year and the shutdown of our Big Sky Mine at the end of 2003. Results in the Southwest approximated prior year levels, as pricing improvements generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased $81.4 million, or 40.9%, compared to prior year due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.11, or 25.8%, and an increase in volume of 5.4 million tons, or 11.7%. Improved pricing led to increased margins in our Eastern operations, despite higher processing costs incurred to upgrade from steam to metallurgical quality, the cost of substitute coal purchases to enable production to be sold in higher value metallurgical coal markets, hurricane related transportation and production interruption and increased fuel and steel costs. Appalachia operations drove the improvement in the East with a $101.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Appalachia region benefited from strong demand driven pricing and volume and increased higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Our operations in Appalachia also benefited during the current year from $21.0 million in insurance recoveries and a $9.6 million increase in earnings from our equity interest in a joint venture, more than offsetting higher costs due to equipment and geologic difficulties at a mine in Kentucky. Adjusted EBITDA in the Midwest was $20.1 million less than prior year as increased production and sales, as well as higher overall sales prices, did not overcome poor geologic conditions at certain mines, higher equipment repair costs and higher fuel and steel costs. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $48.1 million in the current year. Our acquisition of two mines in April 2004 added 4.8 million tons and increased overall sales volume to 6.1 million tons. Most of the increase in sales tonnage was in higher margin metallurgical coal sales, driving a margin per ton increase of $6.55, or nearly 400%. The current year acquisitions contributed $43.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2004. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.8 million from the prior year primarily due to higher brokerage results in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA from trading activities increased over prior year due to improved pricing on our long position. 43 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,899 $ 604,038 $ 169,861 28.1 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (214,655 ) (193,760 ) (20,895 ) (10.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (270,159 ) (234,336 ) (35,823 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (42,387 ) (31,156 ) (11,231 ) (36.0 )% Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) (53,513 ) 51,762 96.7 % Interest expense (96,793 ) (98,540 ) 1,747 1.8 % Interest income 4,917 4,086 831 20.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ 153,071 $ (3,181 ) $ 156,252 n/a Total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.9 million for the current year is compared with $604.0 million from the prior year in the discussion above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, resource management and our Venezuelan mining operations. The increase in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to: net gains on asset sales were $8.8 million higher in the prior year. The prior year includes gains of $18.8 million on the sale of land, coal reserves and oil and gas rights, $6.4 million of other asset disposals, and $7.6 million from the sale of 1.15 million units of Penn Virginia Resource Partners LP (Penn Virginia), while the current year includes gains of only $8.0 million from other asset disposals and a $15.8 million gain from the sale of a total of 0.775 million units of Penn Virginia in two separate transactions; increased costs in 2004 for generation development ($5.3 million) related to the further development of the Prairie State and Thoroughbred Energy campuses; higher selling and administrative expenses of $34.5 million, primarily associated with higher long term incentive costs ($17.8 million), pensions, an increase in outside services costs (including costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the impact of current year acquisitions; and a $2.9 million increase in our accrual for future environmental obligations. These increased costs compared to prior year were partially offset by: lower costs ($29.0 million) in 2004 associated with past mining obligations, primarily lower retiree health care costs from the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and lower closed and suspended mine spending; contributions ($1.2 million) to Adjusted EBITDA from the December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $35.8 million during 2004 due to higher volume and acquisitions. Asset retirement obligation expense increased $11.2 million during the year due to increased or accelerated reclamation work at certain closed mine sites and the acquisition of additional mining operations during the year. 44 Table of Contents Debt extinguishment costs were $51.8 million higher in the prior year due to the significant prepayment premiums associated with the March 2003 refinancing, discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

The tax benefit recorded in 2004 differs from the benefit in 2003 primarily as a result of significantly higher pre tax income, partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion. The 2004 tax benefit also included a net $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on those net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) and alternative minimum tax credits. We evaluated and assessed the expected near term utilization of NOLs, book and taxable income trends, available tax strategies and the overall deferred tax position to determine the amount and timing of valuation allowance adjustments; a $2.8 million loss, net of tax, from discontinued operations in the current year due to costs to resolve a contract indemnification claim related to our former Citizens Power subsidiary; lower minority interests during 2004 due to the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million, relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the recession of EITF No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Summary In 2003, our revenues rose to $2.82 billion, a 3.5% increase over the prior year, led by industry record sales volume of 203.2 million tons. Our sales volume in the second half of 2003 was 8.6% stronger than the first half as generators completed upgrades to emission control equipment and increased coal consumption to meet growing industrial demand. 45 Table of Contents Our segment Adjusted EBITDA totaled $604.0 million for the full year, compared with $616.3 million in the prior year. Excluding $37.1 million in contract settlements from Western U.S. Minings 2002 results, segment Adjusted EBITDA improved $24.8 million. The improvement was due to higher Western U.S. Mining and Trading and Brokerage results, which more than offset a decrease in Eastern U.S. Mining Adjusted EBITDA results. Net income in 2003 totaled $31.3 million, or $0.29 per share, compared with $105.5 million, or $0.98 per share in 2002. The decrease in net income was due to higher asset retirement obligation costs resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 143, combined with $53.5 million in early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, both recorded in the first half of 2003. Revenues Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 2,729,323 $ 2,630,371 $ 98,952 3.8 % Other revenues 85,973 89,267 (3,294 ) (3.7 )% Total revenues $ 2,815,296 $ 2,719,638 $ 95,658 3.5 % Overall, our revenues increased 3.5% over the prior year. Sales increased 3.8% due to a 5.2% sales volume improvement in 2003. Volume from our brokerage operations increased substantially in 2003 due to improved domestic and export demand, and the inclusion of a full year of sales from the Australian mining operations (Wilkie Creek) acquired in August 2002 also contributed to the volume increase. In the West, revenues were essentially flat compared with the prior year, as record volumes due to strong second half demand in the Powder River Basin were offset by lower volumes in the Southwest as a result of customer outages due to major power plant repairs in the first half of the year. In the East, revenues declined 5.4% as slightly higher volumes in the Midwest to meet higher demand were more than offset by lower production in Appalachia due to poor weather in both the first and second quarters, and lower production at the Harris Mine and certain contract mines due to equipment and geologic difficulties. Midwest production overcame ramp up issues at the new Highland Mine and the Vermilion Grove portal of the Riola Mine. Overall, our average sales price decreased 1.4%, due to $27.7 million in sales recorded in 2002 as a result of a favorable arbitration ruling that resulted in a retroactive price adjustment to our Navajo station coal supply agreement, combined with a change in sales mix, as higher priced tons in the Appalachia and Midwest regions represented a lower percentage of our overall sales in 2003. On a regional basis, excluding the effect of the arbitration ruling in the prior year, in 2003 we realized comparable pricing in Appalachia, and improved pricing in the Southwest and Powder River Basin. Midwest prices decreased slightly from 2002 levels. 46 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $604.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $616.3 million for the full year 2002, broken down as follows: Increase (Decrease) Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 357,021 $ 356,392 $ 629 0.2 % Eastern U.S. Mining 198,964 219,940 (20,976 ) (9.5 )% Australian Mining 2,225 3,007 (782 ) (26.0 )% Trading and Brokerage 45,828 36,984 8,844 23.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 604,038 $ 616,323 $ (12,285 ) (2.0 )% Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $0.6 million in 2003. Excluding $37.1 million from 2002 results related to a favorable arbitration ruling and a mediated settlement, Western U.S. Mining Adjusted EBITDA improved $37.7 million, and our margin per ton improved $0.27, or 11%. The improvement was driven by our Powder River Basin operations, which realized improved pricing and record volume from strong demand for its products, combined with lower maintenance and repair costs, that overcame higher fuel and explosives costs. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern operations decreased $21.0 million (margin per ton decreased $0.27, or 6%) as a result of a $32.9 million decrease in contribution from our Appalachia operations, primarily due to lower production and higher costs at the Harris Mine, as a result of geologic difficulties, and equipment related operating difficulties at certain contract mines in 2003. This decrease was partially offset by a $12.0 million improvement in our Midwest operations results. The Midwest operations benefited from higher overall volume and improved pricing at our Black Beauty operations, which overcame higher fuel and explosives costs and ramp up issues at the new Vermilion Grove portal of the Riola Mine. Adjusted EBITDA from Trading and Brokerage operations increased $8.8 million over the prior year, primarily due to higher profit from improved brokerage volume and the impact of adopting EITF Issue 02 3, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Trading and Brokerage results in 2003 included $6.8 million in unrealized profit related to a contract restructuring wherein the new contracts terms and conditions required it to be classified as a derivative (and therefore marked to market). The unrealized profit related to this contract is expected to be converted to cash by the end of 2005. An additional $5.3 million of unrealized profit related to three other contract modifications, and the unrealized profit related to these contracts was converted to cash during 2004. 47 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 604,038 $ 616,323 $ (12,285 ) (2.0 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (193,760 ) (210,222 ) 16,462 7.8 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (234,336 ) (232,413 ) (1,923 ) (0.8 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (31,156 ) (31,156 ) n/a Early debt extinguishment costs (53,513 ) (53,513 ) n/a Interest expense (98,540 ) (102,458 ) 3,918 3.8 % Interest income 4,086 7,574 (3,488 ) (46.1 )% Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ (3,181 ) $ 78,804 $ (81,985 ) n/a Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $604.0 million for the full year, compared with $616.3 million in the prior year (discussed above). Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. In 2003, these results were impacted by: higher net gains on property disposals of $9.4 million; a $7.6 million gain in 2003 on the sale of 1.15 million units of Penn Virginia; higher selling and administrative expenses of $7.1 million associated with salaried pensions, incentive compensation, litigation, additional healthcare cost controls and Sarbanes Oxley compliance; and lower costs ($7.3 million) associated with past mining obligations, as the prior year included a $17.2 million charge related to an adverse U.S. Supreme Court decision which assigned us responsibility for the health care premiums of certain beneficiaries previously withdrawn by the Social Security Administration, while the current year included higher retiree healthcare costs of $8.9 million. Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests decreased $82.0 million from 2002, due to early debt extinguishment costs of $53.5 million incurred in 2003 pursuant to our refinancing (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements) and asset retirement obligation expense of $31.2 million recognized in 2003 in accordance with SFAS No. 143. Expense in 2002 related to reclamation activities was $11.0 million and was included in operating costs and expenses in the statement of operations. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Interest expense in 2003 decreased $3.9 million, due to $8.9 million in savings realized from our 2003 refinancing, partially offset by $5.0 million higher costs related to surety bonds and letters of credit used to secure our obligations for reclamation, workers compensation and lease commitments. Prior year interest income included $4.6 million in interest income received related to excise tax refunds. 48 Table of Contents Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ (3,181 ) $ 78,804 $ (81,985 ) n/a Income tax benefit 47,708 40,007 7,701 19.2 % Minority interests (3,035 ) (13,292 ) 10,257 77.2 % Income before accounting changes 41,492 105,519 (64,027 ) (60.7 )% Cumulative effect of accounting changes (10,144 ) (10,144 ) n/a Net income $ 31,348 $ 105,519 $ (74,171 ) (70.3 )% Net income decreased $74.2 million from 2002 due to the decrease in income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, combined with: a higher tax benefit of $7.7 million in 2003. The tax benefit recorded in 2003 differs from the tax expense in 2002 primarily as a result of the magnitude of the percentage depletion deduction (which is a permanent difference) relative to pre tax income, and a $10.0 million adjustment to our tax reserves; lower minority interests expense in 2003 due to the purchase of the remaining 25% of Arclar Coal Company in September 2002 and the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of EITF No. 98 10, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as there continues to be growth in the U.S., Chinese, Pacific Rim and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. Published indices also show improved year over year coal prices in most U.S. and global coal markets, and world wide coal supply/demand fundamentals remain tight due to market demand and transportation and production infrastructure limitations in most countries. Metallurgical coal is generally selling at a significant premium to steam coal. We expect our recently acquired Australian operations, which produce primarily metallurgical coal, to further enable us to capitalize on the strong global coal markets. In the United States, we expect coal demand to remain strong in 2005, assuming continued economic strength, normal weather, and available transportation for coal. Strong demand for coal and coal based electricity generation is being driven by the strengthening economy, low customer stockpiles, production difficulties for some producers, capacity constraints of nuclear generation and high prices of natural gas and oil. The high price of natural gas is leading coal fueled generating plants to operate at increasing levels. We expect that high costs and unpredictable supplies of oil and natural gas are likely to remain for the foreseeable future. Current average inventories at U.S. generators are estimated to be below five year averages and coal fueled electricity generation is expected to increase to record levels. Generation from nuclear power is currently constrained by capacity. We expect the Powder River Basin to remain the largest and fastest growing region in the United States for coal production due to its abundant coal reserves, low sulfur content and low mining costs. Year to year fluctuations in demand will occur based on weather and the strength of the economy. A 49 Table of Contents number of customers plan test burns and increased use of blending to reduce the supply/demand imbalance of Central Appalachian coals. Strong demand is also expected for coals from Colorado, the Midwest and Northern Appalachia. We are targeting 2005 production of 210 million to 220 million tons and total sales volume of 240 million to 250 million tons, including 12 to 14 million tons of metallurgical coal. Over 95% of our total production in 2005 has been priced (including 90% of our metallurgical coal production). Management expects strong market conditions and operating performance to overcome external cost pressures and adverse rail and port performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs. In addition, historically low interest rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities Our subsidiaries have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs, workers compensation obligations and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 for these liabilities totaled $146.0 million, while payments were $194.2 million, including a $50.0 million voluntary pre funding of one pension plan. Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injury and illness obligations. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. 50 Table of Contents Health care cost trend rate (dollars in thousands): One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 7,960 $ (5,462 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 138,793 $ (116,488 ) Discount rate (dollars in thousands): One Half One Half Percentage Point Percentage Point Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 987 $ (1,150 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (65,051 ) $ 71,496 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.43 years at December 31, 2004. Asset Retirement Obligations Our method for accounting for reclamation activities changed on January 1, 2003 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates related to surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. The asset retirement obligation is determined by mine and we use various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the revisions to the obligation and asset are recognized at the appropriate credit adjusted risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $42.4 million, and payments totaled $45.8 million. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal in over the counter markets. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal and emission allowance positions. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Ninety nine percent of the contracts in our trading portfolio as of December 31, 2004 were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials, and one percent of our contracts were valued based on similar market transactions. As of December 31, 2004, one hundred percent of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2005. 51 Table of Contents Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future book and taxable income trends, available tax planning strategies and the overall deferred tax position. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest, as considered appropriate by management. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 98% of our revenue in 2004 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these agreements, risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and debt and equity offerings related to significant transactions. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs, costs related to past mining obligations and planned acquisitions and development activities. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above, in excess of the primary uses. We typically fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations, and during 2004 and 2003 have had no borrowings outstanding under our $900.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which we use primarily for standby letters of credit. This provides us with available borrowing capacity ($554.1 million as of December 31, 2004) to use to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs. Operating activities provided $283.8 million of cash in 2004, an increase of $94.9 million compared with prior year. A $136.7 million increase in net income from continuing operations was the primary contributor to the improvement. Partially offsetting this increase was higher pension plan funding of 52 Table of Contents $44.6 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we electively funded $50.0 million to one pension plan, the remaining $12.1 million of current year pension funding was toward minimum funding obligations for our pension plans. By contrast, contributions were $17.5 million in the prior year, $9.9 million of which was voluntary. Net cash used in investing activities was $705.0 million in 2004, $512.8 million more than prior year. Investment spending in 2004 includes $421.3 million for the acquisition of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado and two mines in Australia. In the prior year, we spent $90.0 million to acquire the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company. Capital spending of $266.6 million in the current year was $110.2 million more than prior year expenditures of $156.4 million. Current year spending included a large loading facility upgrade in our Powder River Basin operations, $114.7 million of initial payments related to the successful acquisition of a total of 621 million tons of Powder River Basin coal reserves, and equipment purchases in the Midwest and at Australian mines acquired during 2004. In December 2004, we acquired a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and manages the Paso Diablo mine in Venezuela, for a net purchase price of $32.5 million. Proceeds from property and equipment disposals were $30.2 million lower than prior year primarily due to the sale of oil and gas rights, land and coal reserves and surplus surface land in Appalachia in 2003, with no comparable transactions in 2004. Financing activities provided $693.4 million in 2004 compared with $48.6 million in the prior year, an increase of $644.8 million. The current year included net proceeds from our March 2004 debt and equity offerings of $627.8 million. We issued 17.65 million common shares at $22.50 per share, raising $383.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses, and $250 million from our issuance of 5.875% Senior Notes due in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed a repricing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of an amended $450 million Term Loan and a $900 million Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of the repricing, the previous term loan was extinguished and a new loan with nearly identical terms, but a lower interest rate, was issued. The previous Term Loan had been repriced during the first quarter of 2004 concurrent with a $300 million increase in capacity of the revolving loan. Additional payments on long term debt in 2004 were $36.3 million. During the first half of 2003, we refinanced our debt utilizing proceeds from long term debt of $1.1 billion to, among other things, repay line of credit borrowings of $121.6 million and long term debt of $831.0 million and to pay $23.7 million in debt issuance costs in connection with the new debt issued. The prior year included other debt repayments of $37.4 million. Securitized interest in accounts receivable increased $110.0 million in 2004 compared to a decrease of $46.4 million in the prior year. Financing cash flows in the current and prior year periods included dividends of $32.6 million and $24.1 million, respectively. A detailed discussion of our debt instruments and refinancing activity is included in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our total indebtedness consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2004 2003 Term Loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility $ 448,750 $ 446,625 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 239,525 Fair value of interest rate swaps 6.875% Senior Notes 5,189 4,239 5.0% Subordinated Notes 73,621 79,412 Other 7,880 16,263 Total $ 1,424,965 $ 1,196,539 We filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in October 2003, which was declared effective in March 2004, allowing us to offer and sell from time to time 53 Table of Contents unsecured debt securities consisting of notes, debentures, and other debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants; and or units totaling a maximum of $1.25 billion. The 2004 debt and equity offerings noted above were made under this universal shelf registration statement, which remains in effect. The shelf registration statement has a remaining capacity of $602.9 million. Related proceeds could be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of other debt, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions and any other purposes that may be stated in any prospectus supplement. As of December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We had letters of credit outstanding under the facility of $345.9 million, leaving $554.1 million available for borrowing. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, and the 5.0% Subordinated Notes as of December 31, 2004. In May 2003, we entered into and designated four interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $100.0 million as a fair value hedge of our 6.875% Senior Notes. Under the swaps, we pay a floating rate that resets each March 15 and September 15, based upon the six month LIBOR rate, for a period of ten years ending March 15, 2013 and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The average applicable floating rate of the four swaps was 5.14% as of December 31, 2004. At current LIBOR levels, we would realize annualized savings of approximately $1.7 million over the term of the swaps. In September 2003, we entered into two $400.0 million interest rate swaps. One $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2010, was designated as a hedge of changes in expected cash flows on the term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under this swap we pay a fixed rate of 6.764% and receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% (4.99% at December 31, 2004) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate. Another $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2013, was designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Under this swap, we pay a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.97% (4.46% at December 31, 2004) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The swaps will lower our overall borrowing costs on $400.0 million of debt principal by 0.64% over the term of the floating to fixed swap. This results in annual interest savings of $2.6 million over the term of the fixed to floating swap. The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 900,000 $ 900,000 In October 2004, our board of directors approved a 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend on common stock, to $0.075 per share. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Year Within After 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 95,126 $ 243,516 $ 460,966 $ 1,234,582 Capital lease obligations 892 790 38 Operating leases obligations 92,817 138,097 69,960 49,417 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 141,822 5,677 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 79,035 274,562 207,656 52,996 Other long term liabilities(2) 172,582 344,892 355,376 908,744 Total contractual cash obligations $ 582,274 $ 1,007,534 $ 1,093,996 $ 2,245,739 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We had $147.5 million of purchase obligations related to future capital expenditures at December 31, 2004. Commitments for coal reserve related expenditures, including Federal Coal Leases, are included in Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations in the table above. The contractual commitments detailed in the table above do not include expenditures related to the Federal Coal Lease bid that was won in February 2005 and the related tons are not included in our reserves. Total capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to range from $450 million to $500 million. Approximately 50% of projected 2005 capital expenditures relates to the Federal Coal Leases and longwall equipment at the Twentymile Mine and longwall replacement components in Australia, and the remainder is expected be used to purchase or develop reserves, replace or add equipment, fund cost reduction initiatives and upgrade equipment and facilities at the operations we recently acquired. We anticipate funding these capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related and reclamation liabilities included above are expected to be funded from operating cash flow, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases and coal reserves. We believe the risk of generating lower than anticipated operating cash flow in 2005 is reduced by our high level of sales commitments (over 95% of 2005 planned production), improved pricing and ongoing efforts to improve our operating cost structure. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. 55 Table of Contents We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in millions): Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total Self Bonding $ 653.3 $ $ $ $ $ 653.3 Surety Bonds 294.5 134.3 91.7 27.6 548.1 Letters of Credit 0.4 25.1 72.9 120.1 130.7 349.2 $ 948.2 $ 159.4 $ 164.6 $ 120.1 $ 158.3 $ 1,550.6 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and collateral for surety companies. We have guaranteed $9.2 million of debt of an affiliate in which we have a 49% equity investment, as described in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Our remaining guarantees and indemnifications are discussed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. In March 2000, we established an accounts receivable securitization program. Under the program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to the Seller are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We used proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable in lieu of drawing down on our revolving credit facility or to repay long term debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. On September 16, 2004, we and our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary closed on an expansion of the accounts receivable securitization facility. Under the terms of the amended agreement, the total facility capacity was increased from $140 million to $225 million and the receivables of additional wholly owned subsidiaries of ours are now eligible to participate in the facility. The maturity of the facility was also extended to September 2009. All other terms and conditions remain substantially unchanged. The funding cost of the securitization program was $1.7 million and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, the securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from our consolidated balance sheet. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit were $200.0 million and $90.0 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A detailed description of our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization is included in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS No. 123(R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005 (for calendar year companies), and we expect to adopt the standard on that date, using one of the two methods permitted by SFAS No. 123(R), described below: A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments 56 Table of Contents granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. Had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The precise impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on us in 2005 and beyond cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of equity based compensation granted in the future. However, because we make our annual equity based compensation grants in January, prior to the issuance of our financial statements, an estimate of the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on 2005 net income can be made. Based on stock option grants made in January 2005, considering option grants outstanding in 2005 made prior to 2005, and assuming no additional stock option grants in 2005 beyond January 2005, we anticipate (assuming the modified prospective method is used) recognizing expense for stock options for the period from July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 of $2.3 million, net of taxes. It should be noted that annual equity based compensation grants in years prior to 2005 consisted of a higher number of stock options than the grant made in 2005. For the January 2005 grant, we delivered comparable equity based compensation value by granting a combination of stock options and restricted stock. Prior to January 2005, we had not previously granted restricted stock as part of our annual compensation strategy. Expense related to restricted stock (which vests over five years, and assuming no grants beyond January 2005) is anticipated to be approximately $0.8 million, net of taxes, in 2005. Risks Relating to Our Company If a substantial portion of our long term coal supply agreements terminate, our revenues and operating profits could suffer if we were unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms to those in our contracts. A substantial portion of our sales is made under coal supply agreements, which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations. The execution of a satisfactory coal supply agreement is frequently the basis on which we undertake the development of coal reserves required to be supplied under the contract. For the year ended December 31, 2004, 90% of our sales volume was sold under long term coal supply agreements. At December 31, 2004, our coal supply agreements had remaining terms ranging from one to 17 years and an average volume weighted remaining term of approximately 3.4 years. Many of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price upward or downward at specified times. We may adjust these contract prices based on inflation or deflation and or changes in the factors affecting the cost of producing coal, such as taxes, fees, royalties and changes in the laws regulating the mining, production, sale or use of coal. In a limited number of contracts, failure of the parties to agree on a price under those provisions may allow either party to terminate the contract. We sometimes experience a reduction in coal prices in new long term coal supply agreements replacing some of our expiring contracts. Coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party. Most coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as Btu, sulfur content, ash content, grindability and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications 57 Table of Contents could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts. Moreover, some of these agreements permit the customer to terminate the contract if transportation costs, which our customers typically bear, increase substantially. In addition, some of these contracts allow our customers to terminate their contracts in the event of changes in regulations affecting our industry that increase the price of coal beyond specified limits. The operating profits we realize from coal sold under supply agreements depend on a variety of factors. In addition, price adjustment and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility provided by those contracts. If a substantial portion of our coal supply agreements were modified or terminated, we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to find alternate buyers for our coal at the same level of profitability. Market prices for coal decreased in most regions in 2002. In 2003, pricing improved for eastern coal regions and moved slightly higher for western coal regions, and in 2004 pricing was substantially higher for the eastern coal regions and slightly higher for western coal regions. As a result, we cannot predict the future strength of the coal market and cannot assure you that we will be able to replace existing long term coal supply agreements at the same prices or with similar profit margins when they expire. In addition, two of our largest coal supply agreements are the subject of ongoing litigation and arbitration. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we derived 25% of our total coal revenues from sales to our five largest customers. At December 31, 2004, we had 45 coal supply agreements with these customers expiring at various times from 2005 to 2011. We are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long term agreements with some of these customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and those customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long term coal supply agreements. If a number of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially. Peabody Western has a long term coal supply agreement with the owners of the Mohave Generating Station that expires on December 31, 2005. Southern California Edison (the majority owner and operator of the plant) is involved in a California Public Utilities Commission proceeding related to the operation of the Mohave plant beyond 2005 or the temporary or permanent shutdown of the plant. In a July 2003 filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, the operator affirmed that the Mohave plant was not forecast to return to service as a coal fueled resource until mid 2009 at the earliest if the plant is shutdown at December 31, 2005. Southern California Edison has subsequently reaffirmed this forecast to the Commission. On December 2, 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission issued an opinion authorizing Southern California Edison to make necessary expenditures at the Mohave plant to preserve the Mohave open option while Southern California Edison continues to seek resolution of the water and coal issues. The opinion stated that its goal was to return the Mohave plant to service with as short of a shut down period as possible. There is a dispute with the Hopi Tribe regarding the use of groundwater in the transportation of the coal by pipeline from Peabody Westerns Black Mesa Mine to the Mohave plant. As a part of the alternate dispute resolution referenced in the Navajo Nation litigation, Peabody Western has been negotiating with the owners of the Mohave Generating Station and the Navajo Generating Station, and the two tribes to resolve the complex issues surrounding the groundwater dispute and other disputes involving the two generating stations. Resolution of these issues is critical to the continuation of the operation of the Mohave Generating Station and the renewal of the coal supply agreement after December 31, 2005. There is no assurance that the issues critical to the continued operation of the Mohave plant will be resolved. If these issues are not resolved in a timely manner, the operation of the Mohave plant will cease or be suspended on December 31, 2005. Absent a satisfactory alternate dispute resolution, it is unlikely that the coal supply agreement for the Mohave plant will be renewed in time to avoid a shutdown of the mine in 2006. The Mohave plant is the sole customer of the Black Mesa Mine, 58 Table of Contents which sold 4.7 million tons in 2004. In 2004, the mine generated $25.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA, which represents 4.5% of our total of $559.2 million. Our financial performance could be adversely affected by our substantial debt. Our financial performance could be affected by our substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2004, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,425.0 million, and we had $554.1 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to: making it more difficult for us to pay interest and satisfy our debt obligations; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate uses; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the coal industry; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors. In addition, our indebtedness subjects us to financial and other restrictive covenants. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets secure our indebtedness under our credit facility. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of sufficient operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The credit facility and the indenture governing the notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If transportation for our coal becomes unavailable or uneconomic for our customers, our ability to sell coal could suffer. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customers purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy or could make some of our operations less competitive than other sources of coal. Certain coal supply agreements, which account for less than 5% of our tons sold, permit the customer to terminate the contract if the cost of transportation increases by an amount ranging from 10% to 20% in any given 12 month period. Coal producers depend upon rail, barge, trucking, overland conveyor, pipeline and ocean going vessels to deliver coal to markets. While our coal customers typically arrange and pay for transportation of coal from the mine or port to the point of use, disruption of these transportation services because of weather related problems, strikes, lock outs, transportation delays or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers and thus could adversely affect our results of operations. For 59 Table of Contents example, the high volume of coal shipped from all Powder River Basin mines could create temporary congestion on the rail systems servicing that region. Continued increases in coal demand, combined with many customers inventories that are lower than historical averages, created periodic regional rail and port congestion in 2004. To the extent rail or port congestion constrains our operations ability to successfully ship coal to our customers, our operating results will be reduced. Risks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating our business. Our mining operations are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include weather and natural disasters, unexpected maintenance problems, key equipment failures, variations in coal seam thickness, variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the coal deposit, variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geologic conditions. Our mining operations are extensively regulated, which imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal. Federal, state and local authorities regulate the coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. In addition, significant legislation mandating specified benefits for retired coal miners affects our industry. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment. The costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production. The possibility exists that new legislation and or regulations and orders may be adopted that may materially adversely affect our mining operations, our cost structure and or our customers ability to use coal. New legislation or administrative regulations (or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations), including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. The majority of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchasers plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use. These factors and legislation, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the United States and over 160 other nations are signatories to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is intended to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. In December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, the signatories to the convention established a binding set of emission targets for developed nations, which took effect in February 2005. Although the specific emission targets vary from country to country, the United States would be required to reduce emissions to 93% of 1990 levels over a five year budget period from 2008 through 2012. Although the United States has not ratified the emission targets and no comprehensive regulations focusing on greenhouse gas emissions are in place, these restrictions, whether through ratification of the emission targets or other efforts to stabilize or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, could adversely affect the price and demand for coal. According to the Department of Energys Energy Information Administration Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2003, coal accounts for 31% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions could result in reduced use of coal if electricity generators switch to lower carbon sources of fuel. Further developments in connection with regulations or other limits on carbon dioxide emissions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 60 Table of Contents Our expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. We provide postretirement health and life insurance benefits to eligible union and non union employees. We calculated the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, which we estimate had a present value of $1,020.8 million as of December 31, 2004, $81.3 million of which was a current liability. We have estimated these unfunded obligations based on assumptions described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits. We are party to an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or the PBGC, and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make specified contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States). As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries participate in two defined benefit multi employer pension funds that were established as a result of collective bargaining with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) pursuant to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement as periodically negotiated. The UMWA 1950 Pension Plan provides pension and disability pension benefits to qualifying represented employees retiring from a participating employer where the employee last worked prior to January 1, 1976. This is a closed group of beneficiaries with no new entrants. The UMWA 1974 Pension Plan provides pension and disability pension benefits to qualifying represented employees retiring from a participating employer where the employee last worked after December 31, 1975. Contributions to these funds could increase as a result of future collective bargaining with the United Mine Workers of America, a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency of other coal companies who currently contribute to these funds, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, higher medical and drug costs or other funding deficiencies. The United Mine Workers of America Combined Fund was created by federal law in 1992. This multi employer fund provides health care benefits to a closed group of our retired former employees who last worked prior to 1976, as well as orphaned beneficiaries of out of business companies who were receiving benefits as orphans prior to the 1992 law; no new retirees will be added to this group. The liability is subject to increases or decreases in per capita health care costs, offset by the mortality curve in this aging population of beneficiaries. Another fund, the 1992 Benefit Plan also created by the same federal law in 1992 provides benefits to qualifying retired former employees of companies who have gone out of business and have defaulted in providing their former employees with retiree medical benefits. Beneficiaries continue to be added to this fund as employers go out of business, but the overall exposure for new beneficiaries into this fund is limited to retirees covered under their employers plan who retired prior to October 1, 1994. Another fund, the 1993 Benefit Fund was established through collective bargaining and provides retiree medical benefits to qualifying retired former employees who retired after September 30, 1994 of certain signatory companies who have gone out of business and have defaulted in providing their former employees with retiree medical benefits. Beneficiaries continue to be added to this fund as employers go out of business. 61 Table of Contents Based upon the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, we assumed future cash savings which allowed us to reduce our projected post retirement benefit obligations and related expense. Failure to achieve these assumed future savings under all benefit plans could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our future success depends upon our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves that are economically recoverable. Our recoverable reserves decline as we produce coal. We have not yet applied for the permits required or developed the mines necessary to use all of our reserves. Furthermore, we may not be able to mine all of our reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations. Our future success depends upon our conducting successful exploration and development activities or acquiring properties containing economically recoverable reserves. Our current strategy includes increasing our reserves through acquisitions of government and other leases and producing properties and continuing to use our existing properties. The federal government also leases natural gas and coalbed methane reserves in the West, including in the Powder River Basin. Some of these natural gas and coalbed methane reserves are located on, or adjacent to, some of our Powder River Basin reserves, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and lessees of those interests. Other lessees rights relating to these mineral interests could prevent, delay or increase the cost of developing our coal reserves. These lessees may also seek damages from us based on claims that our coal mining operations impair their interests. Additionally, the federal government limits the amount of federal land that may be leased by any company to 150,000 acres nationwide. As of December 31, 2004, we leased a total of 60,140 acres from the federal government and added an additional 17,598 through February 2005. The limit could restrict our ability to lease additional federal lands. For additional discussion of our federal leases see Item 2. Properties of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our planned mine development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have continuing success developing additional mines. Most of our mining operations are conducted on properties owned or leased by us. Because title to most of our leased properties and mineral rights are not thoroughly verified until a permit to mine the property is obtained, our right to mine some of our reserves may be materially adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist. In addition, in order to develop our reserves, we must receive various governmental permits. We cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the permits necessary for us to operate profitably in the future. We may not be able to negotiate new leases from the government or from private parties or obtain mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interest in properties on which mining operations are not commenced during the term of the lease. From time to time, we have experienced litigation with lessors of our coal properties and with royalty holders. A decrease in the production of our metallurgical coal (or other high margin products) or a decrease in the price of metallurgical coal (or other high margin products) could decrease our anticipated profitability. We more than doubled our sales of metallurgical coal in 2004, primarily as a result of the acquisition of coal operations in Australia in April 2004. Our current annual capacity for metallurgical coal production is approximately 12 to 14 million tons. Prices for metallurgical coal in late 2004 and early 2005 have reached historically high levels. We have committed 90% of our projected 2005 metallurgical coal production at significantly higher prices than in the past. As a result, our projected margins from these sales have increased significantly, and will represent a larger percentage of our overall revenues and profits in 2005. To the extent we experience either production or transportation difficulties that impair our ability to ship metallurgical coal to our customers at anticipated levels, our profitability will be reduced in 2005. After 2005, we have metallurgical coal production that has not yet been priced. As a result, a decrease in metallurgical coal prices could decrease our profitability beyond 2005. 62 Table of Contents An inability of contract miner or brokerage sources to fulfill the delivery terms of their contracts with us could reduce our profitability. In conducting our trading, brokerage and mining operations, we utilize third party sources of coal production, including contract miners and brokerage sources, to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements. Our profitability or exposure to loss on transactions or relationships such as these is dependent upon the reliability (including financial viability) and price of the third party supply, our obligation to supply coal to customers in the event that adverse geologic mining conditions restrict deliveries from our suppliers, our willingness to participate in temporary cost increases experienced by our third party coal suppliers, our ability to pass on temporary cost increases to our customers, the ability to substitute, when economical, third party coal sources with internal production or coal purchased in the market, and other factors. If the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future, our profitability could be impaired. During the mid 1970s and early 1980s, a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry, spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry, all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices. Similarly, continued increases in future coal prices could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers. Any overcapacity could reduce coal prices in the future. We could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations. As of December 31, 2004, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 7,900 employees. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 40% of our hourly employees were represented by unions and they generated 21% of our 2004 coal production. Relations with our employees, and where applicable, organized labor, are important to our success. United States The United Mine Workers of America represented approximately 30% of our hourly employees, who generated 16% of our production during the year ended December 31, 2004. An additional 6% of our hourly employees are represented by labor unions other than the United Mine Workers of America. These employees generated 2% of our production during the year ended December 31, 2004. Hourly workers at our mines in Arizona and one of our mines in Colorado are represented by the United Mine Workers of America under the Western Surface Agreement, which was ratified in 2000 and is effective through September 1, 2005. Our union labor east of the Mississippi River is primarily represented by the United Mine Workers of America and the majority of union mines are subject to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement. The current five year labor agreement was ratified in December 2001 and is effective through December 31, 2006. Australia The Australian coal mining industry is highly unionized and the majority of workers employed at our Australian Mining Operations are members of trade unions. These employees are represented by three unions: the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), which represents the production employees, and two unions that represent the other staff. Our Australian employees are approximately 4% of our entire workforce and generated 3% of our total production in the year ended December 31, 2004. The miners at Wilkie Creek operate under a labor agreement that expires in June 2006. The miners at Burton operate under a labor agreement that is currently under negotiation. The miners at North Goonyella operate under a labor agreement which expires in March 2008. The miners at Eaglefield operate under a labor agreement that expires in May 2007. 63 Table of Contents Because of the higher labor costs and the increased risk of strikes and other work related stoppages that may be associated with union operations in the coal industry, our competitors who operate without union labor may have a competitive advantage in areas where they compete with our unionized operations. If some or all of our current non union operations were to become unionized, we could incur an increased risk of work stoppages, reduced productivity and higher labor costs. The 10 month United Mine Workers of America strike in 1993 had a material adverse effect on us. Our operations could be adversely affected if we fail to appropriately secure our obligations. U.S. federal and state laws and Australian laws require us to secure certain of our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers compensation, to secure coal lease obligations and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. The primary method for us to meet those obligations is to post a corporate guarantee (i.e. self bond) or to provide a third party surety bond. As of December 31, 2004, we had $653.3 million of self bonds in place for our reclamation obligations. As of December 31, 2004, we also had outstanding surety bonds with third parties for post mining reclamation totaling $294.5 million. We had an additional $91.7 million of surety bonds in place for workers compensation obligations and $134.3 million of surety bonds securing coal leases. All other bonding, including performance and infrastructure bonds, totaled $27.6 million. These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. It has become increasingly difficult for us to secure new surety bonds or renew bonds without the posting of partial collateral. Surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or to provide a suitable alternatives would have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including the following: lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds; restrictions on the availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of our indenture or new credit facility; and the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety. Our ability to self bond reduces our costs of providing financial assurances. To the extent we are unable to maintain our current level of self bonding, due to legislative or regulatory changes or changes in our financial condition, our costs would increase. Our ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or fail to attract qualified personnel. We manage our business with a number of key personnel, the loss of a number of whom could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, as our business develops and expands, we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. We do not have key person life insurance to cover our executive officers. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending, and market liquidity, which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control, such as terrorist attacks and acts of war. Future terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions affecting our customers may materially adversely affect our operations. As a result, there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to 64 Table of Contents our customers, decreased sales of our coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from our customers. Strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the United States. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government imposed price controls. It is possible that any, or a combination, of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness deteriorates. Our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. Our customer base is changing with deregulation as utilities sell their power plants to their non regulated affiliates or third parties. These new power plant owners or other customers may have credit ratings that are below investment grade. If deterioration of the creditworthiness of our customers occurs, our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected. Our certificate of incorporation and by laws include provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our by laws and certificate of incorporation impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of the stockholders rights plan adopted by our board of directors. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal trading, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes, and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options, and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps at December 31, 2004 and included forwards, futures and options at December 31, 2003. Our policy for accounting for coal trading activities is described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation 65 Table of Contents period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both option and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.5 million, $6.1 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.4 million, $3.2 million, and $1.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, one hundred percent of the value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2005. We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. In the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2005 involves hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2004, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flows hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling $515.0 million of which $285.0 million, $170.0 million and $60.0 million will expire in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Our current expectation for 2005 non capital, Australian dollar denominated cash expenditures is approximately $600 million. A change in the Australian dollar/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of US$0.01 66 Table of Contents (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of $6.0 million per year. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2004, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $872.9 million of fixed rate borrowings and $552.1 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $5.5 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $60.7 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2004 and 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we had sales commitments for over 95% of our 2005 production, leaving 5 to 10 million tons unpriced. Also as of December 31, 2005, we had 65 to 75 million tons and 130 to 140 million tons of expected production available for sale or repricing at market prices for 2006 and 2007, respectively. We have an annual metallurgical coal production capacity of 12 to 14 million tons, all of which is priced for 2005 and none of which is priced beyond March 2006. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. In addition, we utilize derivative contracts to hedge our commodity price exposure. As of December 31, 2004, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel. Notional amounts outstanding under these contracts, scheduled to expire through 2007, were 76.7 million gallons of heating oil and 28.7 million gallons of crude oil. Overall, we have fixed prices for approximately 90% of our anticipated diesel fuel requirements in 2005. We expect to consume approximately 95 million gallons of fuel per year. Based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of approximately $1 million per year. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 32 active coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions and internationally in Australia. In 2004, we sold 227.2 million tons of coal that accounted for an estimated 20% of all U.S. coal sales, and were more than 85% greater than the sales of our closest competitor. The Energy Information Administration estimates that 1.1 billion tons of coal were consumed in the United States in 2004 and expects domestic consumption of coal by electricity generators to grow at a rate of 1.6% per year through 2025. Coal fueled generation is used in most cases to meet baseload electricity requirements, and coal use generally grows at the pace of electricity growth. In 2004, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 52%, which was more than all other fuels used to generate electricity combined. Our primary customers are U.S. utilities, which accounted for 90% of our sales in 2004. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2004, approximately 90% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2004, we had priced more than 95% of our expected 2005 production. As discussed more fully in Risks Relating to Our Company, our results of operations in the near term can be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Eastern U.S. Mining, Western U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Appalachia and Midwest operations, and our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. The principal business of the Western U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. The principal business of the Eastern U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities, as well as the mining of some metallurgical coal, sold to steel and coke producers. Geologically, Eastern operations mine bituminous and Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Our Australian Mining operations consist of our Wilkie Creek Mine, two additional mines acquired in April 2004, Burton and North Goonyella, and our recently opened Eaglefield Mine, which is a surface operation adjacent to, and fulfilling contract tonnages in conjunction with, the North Goonyella underground mine. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining low sulfur, high Btu coal sold to an international customer base. Primarily metallurgical coal is produced from our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 4% of our total sales volume and approximately 3% of U.S. sales volume. In December 2004, we purchased a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 7 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. Each of our mining operations is described in Item 1 of this report. 40 Table of Contents In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 87% of revenues in 2004, we also generate revenues from brokering and trading coal (12% of revenues), and by creating value from our vast natural resource position by selling non core land holdings and mineral interests to generate additional cash flows. We are developing coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. These projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Three projects are currently being evaluated the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, the 1,500 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in Washington County, Illinois and the 300 megawatt Mustang Energy Project near Grants, N.M. During 2004, one of our subsidiaries and Fluor Daniel Illinois, Inc. signed a letter of intent for engineering, design and construction of Prairie States power related facilities. In January 2005, we achieved a major milestone in the development of the Prairie State Energy Campus when the state of Illinois issued an air permit for the electric generating station and coal mine campus. In January 2005, a group of Midwest rural electric cooperatives and municipal joint action agencies entered into definitive agreements to acquire 47% of the project. In February 2005, certain parties filed an appeal with the Environmental Appeals Board in Washington, D.C. challenging the air permit issued by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. The appeal must be resolved before construction of the project can begin. In October 2004, our Mustang Energy Project was awarded a $19.7 million Clean Coal Power Initiative Grant from the Department of Energy to demonstrate technology to achieve ultra low emissions. The plants are expected to be operational following a four year construction phase, which would begin when the company has completed all necessary permitting, selected partners, secured financing and sold the majority of the output of the plant. These plants will not be operational until at least 2010. Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to, and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Summary Our 2004 revenues of $3.63 billion was an increase of 29.0% over prior year, led by improved pricing and an industry record sales volume of 227.2 million tons. Mines acquired in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of sales and 11.0 million tons to our current year results. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the full year totaled $773.9 million, a 28.1% increase over $604.0 million in the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in the current year due to increased sales volumes and price. Net income in 2004 was $175.4 million, or $1.38 per share, an increase of 459.5% over 2003 net income of $31.3 million, or $0.29 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved operating results and acquisitions in 2004, and the impact in 2003 of $53.5 million in pretax early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes. 41 Table of Contents Revenues Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (dollars in thousands) Sales $ 3,545,027 $ 2,729,323 $ 815,704 29.9 % Other revenues 86,555 85,973 582 0.7 % Total revenues $ 3,631,582 $ 2,815,296 $ 816,286 29.0 % Revenues increased by 29.0%, or $816.3 million, over the prior year. The acquisition of three mines in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of total revenue and 11.0 million tons during the year. Excluding revenues from current year acquisitions, U.S. Mining revenues increased $375.4 million, and revenues from our brokerage operations increased $110.9 million on higher pricing and volume worldwide. Our average sales price per ton increased 14.6% during 2004 due to increased overall demand, which has driven pricing higher, most notably in Appalachia, and a change in sales mix. The sales mix has benefited from the increase in sales from the Australian segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets. In addition to geographic mix changes, our 2004 revenues included a greater proportion of higher priced metallurgical coal sales (our highest value product). Pricing of metallurgical coal has been responding to increased international demand for the product. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. Other revenues were relatively unchanged from prior year. In our Eastern U.S. Mining operations, revenues increased $302.8 million, or 25.3%, as a result of higher pricing and volumes from strong steam and metallurgical coal demand. Production increases at most eastern mines more than offset lower than expected production at certain of our mines and contract sources as a result of geologic difficulties, congestion related shipping delays and hurricane related production disruptions and delays. Appalachian revenues led the Eastern U.S. increase, benefiting the most from price increases while also increasing production and sales volumes. Revenues in Appalachia increased $188.1 million, or 37.0%, while in the Midwest, revenues increased by $114.7 million, or 16.6%. Revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $171.6 million, or 14.0% on both increased volumes and prices. However, the primary driver of increased revenues in the West was a 12.6 million ton increase in sales volume. Growth in volumes were primarily in the Powder River Basin operations, where revenues were up $58.6 million, or 7.5%, and from the addition of the Twentymile Mine in April which added $99.0 million to sales. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of stronger demand for the mines low sulfur product, which overcame difficulties with rail service, downtime at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine to upgrade the loading facility and poor weather, which impaired production early in the year. Revenues in our Australian Mining operations increased $241.5 million compared to 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of two operating mines during 2004 and benefiting from higher overall pricing for our products there. 42 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.9 million for the full year was $169.9 million higher than 2003 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $604.0 million, and was composed of the following: Increase (Decrease) to Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 402,131 $ 357,021 $ 45,110 12.6 % Eastern U.S. Mining 280,357 198,964 81,393 40.9 % Australian Mining 50,372 2,225 48,147 2163.9 % Trading and Brokerage 41,039 45,828 (4,789 ) (10.4 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,899 $ 604,038 $ 169,861 28.1 % Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.1 million during 2004, margin per ton increased $0.07, or 2.5%, while sales volume increased 12.6 million tons. The April 2004 acquisition of the Twentymile Mine contributed to $31.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA increase and sales volume, adding 6.2 million tons of the volume increase in 2004. An increase of $20.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA in the Powder River Basin, due primarily to increases in sales volume, contributed most of the remaining improvement in the West. Our Powder River Basin operations continued to benefit from strong demand, leading to record shipping levels which overcame the effects of a planned outage earlier in the year to increase throughput at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine, rail service problems throughout the year and the shutdown of our Big Sky Mine at the end of 2003. Results in the Southwest approximated prior year levels, as pricing improvements generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased $81.4 million, or 40.9%, compared to prior year due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.11, or 25.8%, and an increase in volume of 5.4 million tons, or 11.7%. Improved pricing led to increased margins in our Eastern operations, despite higher processing costs incurred to upgrade from steam to metallurgical quality, the cost of substitute coal purchases to enable production to be sold in higher value metallurgical coal markets, hurricane related transportation and production interruption and increased fuel and steel costs. Appalachia operations drove the improvement in the East with a $101.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Appalachia region benefited from strong demand driven pricing and volume and increased higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Our operations in Appalachia also benefited during the current year from $21.0 million in insurance recoveries and a $9.6 million increase in earnings from our equity interest in a joint venture, more than offsetting higher costs due to equipment and geologic difficulties at a mine in Kentucky. Adjusted EBITDA in the Midwest was $20.1 million less than prior year as increased production and sales, as well as higher overall sales prices, did not overcome poor geologic conditions at certain mines, higher equipment repair costs and higher fuel and steel costs. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $48.1 million in the current year. Our acquisition of two mines in April 2004 added 4.8 million tons and increased overall sales volume to 6.1 million tons. Most of the increase in sales tonnage was in higher margin metallurgical coal sales, driving a margin per ton increase of $6.55, or nearly 400%. The current year acquisitions contributed $43.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2004. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.8 million from the prior year primarily due to higher brokerage results in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA from trading activities increased over prior year due to improved pricing on our long position. 43 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,899 $ 604,038 $ 169,861 28.1 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (214,655 ) (193,760 ) (20,895 ) (10.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (270,159 ) (234,336 ) (35,823 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (42,387 ) (31,156 ) (11,231 ) (36.0 )% Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) (53,513 ) 51,762 96.7 % Interest expense (96,793 ) (98,540 ) 1,747 1.8 % Interest income 4,917 4,086 831 20.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ 153,071 $ (3,181 ) $ 156,252 n/a Total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.9 million for the current year is compared with $604.0 million from the prior year in the discussion above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, resource management and our Venezuelan mining operations. The increase in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to: net gains on asset sales were $8.8 million higher in the prior year. The prior year includes gains of $18.8 million on the sale of land, coal reserves and oil and gas rights, $6.4 million of other asset disposals, and $7.6 million from the sale of 1.15 million units of Penn Virginia Resource Partners LP (Penn Virginia), while the current year includes gains of only $8.0 million from other asset disposals and a $15.8 million gain from the sale of a total of 0.775 million units of Penn Virginia in two separate transactions; increased costs in 2004 for generation development ($5.3 million) related to the further development of the Prairie State and Thoroughbred Energy campuses; higher selling and administrative expenses of $34.5 million, primarily associated with higher long term incentive costs ($17.8 million), pensions, an increase in outside services costs (including costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the impact of current year acquisitions; and a $2.9 million increase in our accrual for future environmental obligations. These increased costs compared to prior year were partially offset by: lower costs ($29.0 million) in 2004 associated with past mining obligations, primarily lower retiree health care costs from the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and lower closed and suspended mine spending; contributions ($1.2 million) to Adjusted EBITDA from the December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $35.8 million during 2004 due to higher volume and acquisitions. Asset retirement obligation expense increased $11.2 million during the year due to increased or accelerated reclamation work at certain closed mine sites and the acquisition of additional mining operations during the year. 44 Table of Contents Debt extinguishment costs were $51.8 million higher in the prior year due to the significant prepayment premiums associated with the March 2003 refinancing, discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.

The tax benefit recorded in 2004 differs from the benefit in 2003 primarily as a result of significantly higher pre tax income, partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion. The 2004 tax benefit also included a net $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on those net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) and alternative minimum tax credits. We evaluated and assessed the expected near term utilization of NOLs, book and taxable income trends, available tax strategies and the overall deferred tax position to determine the amount and timing of valuation allowance adjustments; a $2.8 million loss, net of tax, from discontinued operations in the current year due to costs to resolve a contract indemnification claim related to our former Citizens Power subsidiary; lower minority interests during 2004 due to the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million, relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the recession of EITF No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Summary In 2003, our revenues rose to $2.82 billion, a 3.5% increase over the prior year, led by industry record sales volume of 203.2 million tons. Our sales volume in the second half of 2003 was 8.6% stronger than the first half as generators completed upgrades to emission control equipment and increased coal consumption to meet growing industrial demand. 45 Table of Contents Our segment Adjusted EBITDA totaled $604.0 million for the full year, compared with $616.3 million in the prior year. Excluding $37.1 million in contract settlements from Western U.S. Minings 2002 results, segment Adjusted EBITDA improved $24.8 million. The improvement was due to higher Western U.S. Mining and Trading and Brokerage results, which more than offset a decrease in Eastern U.S. Mining Adjusted EBITDA results. Net income in 2003 totaled $31.3 million, or $0.29 per share, compared with $105.5 million, or $0.98 per share in 2002. The decrease in net income was due to higher asset retirement obligation costs resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 143, combined with $53.5 million in early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, both recorded in the first half of 2003. Revenues Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 2,729,323 $ 2,630,371 $ 98,952 3.8 % Other revenues 85,973 89,267 (3,294 ) (3.7 )% Total revenues $ 2,815,296 $ 2,719,638 $ 95,658 3.5 % Overall, our revenues increased 3.5% over the prior year. Sales increased 3.8% due to a 5.2% sales volume improvement in 2003. Volume from our brokerage operations increased substantially in 2003 due to improved domestic and export demand, and the inclusion of a full year of sales from the Australian mining operations (Wilkie Creek) acquired in August 2002 also contributed to the volume increase. In the West, revenues were essentially flat compared with the prior year, as record volumes due to strong second half demand in the Powder River Basin were offset by lower volumes in the Southwest as a result of customer outages due to major power plant repairs in the first half of the year. In the East, revenues declined 5.4% as slightly higher volumes in the Midwest to meet higher demand were more than offset by lower production in Appalachia due to poor weather in both the first and second quarters, and lower production at the Harris Mine and certain contract mines due to equipment and geologic difficulties. Midwest production overcame ramp up issues at the new Highland Mine and the Vermilion Grove portal of the Riola Mine. Overall, our average sales price decreased 1.4%, due to $27.7 million in sales recorded in 2002 as a result of a favorable arbitration ruling that resulted in a retroactive price adjustment to our Navajo station coal supply agreement, combined with a change in sales mix, as higher priced tons in the Appalachia and Midwest regions represented a lower percentage of our overall sales in 2003. On a regional basis, excluding the effect of the arbitration ruling in the prior year, in 2003 we realized comparable pricing in Appalachia, and improved pricing in the Southwest and Powder River Basin. Midwest prices decreased slightly from 2002 levels. 46 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $604.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared with $616.3 million for the full year 2002, broken down as follows: Increase (Decrease) Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 357,021 $ 356,392 $ 629 0.2 % Eastern U.S. Mining 198,964 219,940 (20,976 ) (9.5 )% Australian Mining 2,225 3,007 (782 ) (26.0 )% Trading and Brokerage 45,828 36,984 8,844 23.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 604,038 $ 616,323 $ (12,285 ) (2.0 )% Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $0.6 million in 2003. Excluding $37.1 million from 2002 results related to a favorable arbitration ruling and a mediated settlement, Western U.S. Mining Adjusted EBITDA improved $37.7 million, and our margin per ton improved $0.27, or 11%. The improvement was driven by our Powder River Basin operations, which realized improved pricing and record volume from strong demand for its products, combined with lower maintenance and repair costs, that overcame higher fuel and explosives costs. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern operations decreased $21.0 million (margin per ton decreased $0.27, or 6%) as a result of a $32.9 million decrease in contribution from our Appalachia operations, primarily due to lower production and higher costs at the Harris Mine, as a result of geologic difficulties, and equipment related operating difficulties at certain contract mines in 2003. This decrease was partially offset by a $12.0 million improvement in our Midwest operations results. The Midwest operations benefited from higher overall volume and improved pricing at our Black Beauty operations, which overcame higher fuel and explosives costs and ramp up issues at the new Vermilion Grove portal of the Riola Mine. Adjusted EBITDA from Trading and Brokerage operations increased $8.8 million over the prior year, primarily due to higher profit from improved brokerage volume and the impact of adopting EITF Issue 02 3, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. Trading and Brokerage results in 2003 included $6.8 million in unrealized profit related to a contract restructuring wherein the new contracts terms and conditions required it to be classified as a derivative (and therefore marked to market). The unrealized profit related to this contract is expected to be converted to cash by the end of 2005. An additional $5.3 million of unrealized profit related to three other contract modifications, and the unrealized profit related to these contracts was converted to cash during 2004. 47 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 604,038 $ 616,323 $ (12,285 ) (2.0 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (193,760 ) (210,222 ) 16,462 7.8 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (234,336 ) (232,413 ) (1,923 ) (0.8 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (31,156 ) (31,156 ) n/a Early debt extinguishment costs (53,513 ) (53,513 ) n/a Interest expense (98,540 ) (102,458 ) 3,918 3.8 % Interest income 4,086 7,574 (3,488 ) (46.1 )% Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ (3,181 ) $ 78,804 $ (81,985 ) n/a Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $604.0 million for the full year, compared with $616.3 million in the prior year (discussed above). Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. In 2003, these results were impacted by: higher net gains on property disposals of $9.4 million; a $7.6 million gain in 2003 on the sale of 1.15 million units of Penn Virginia; higher selling and administrative expenses of $7.1 million associated with salaried pensions, incentive compensation, litigation, additional healthcare cost controls and Sarbanes Oxley compliance; and lower costs ($7.3 million) associated with past mining obligations, as the prior year included a $17.2 million charge related to an adverse U.S. Supreme Court decision which assigned us responsibility for the health care premiums of certain beneficiaries previously withdrawn by the Social Security Administration, while the current year included higher retiree healthcare costs of $8.9 million. Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests decreased $82.0 million from 2002, due to early debt extinguishment costs of $53.5 million incurred in 2003 pursuant to our refinancing (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements) and asset retirement obligation expense of $31.2 million recognized in 2003 in accordance with SFAS No. 143. Expense in 2002 related to reclamation activities was $11.0 million and was included in operating costs and expenses in the statement of operations. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 is discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Interest expense in 2003 decreased $3.9 million, due to $8.9 million in savings realized from our 2003 refinancing, partially offset by $5.0 million higher costs related to surety bonds and letters of credit used to secure our obligations for reclamation, workers compensation and lease commitments. Prior year interest income included $4.6 million in interest income received related to excise tax refunds. 48 Table of Contents Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2003 2002 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ (3,181 ) $ 78,804 $ (81,985 ) n/a Income tax benefit 47,708 40,007 7,701 19.2 % Minority interests (3,035 ) (13,292 ) 10,257 77.2 % Income before accounting changes 41,492 105,519 (64,027 ) (60.7 )% Cumulative effect of accounting changes (10,144 ) (10,144 ) n/a Net income $ 31,348 $ 105,519 $ (74,171 ) (70.3 )% Net income decreased $74.2 million from 2002 due to the decrease in income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, combined with: a higher tax benefit of $7.7 million in 2003. The tax benefit recorded in 2003 differs from the tax expense in 2002 primarily as a result of the magnitude of the percentage depletion deduction (which is a permanent difference) relative to pre tax income, and a $10.0 million adjustment to our tax reserves; lower minority interests expense in 2003 due to the purchase of the remaining 25% of Arclar Coal Company in September 2002 and the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of EITF No. 98 10, as discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as there continues to be growth in the U.S., Chinese, Pacific Rim and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. Published indices also show improved year over year coal prices in most U.S. and global coal markets, and world wide coal supply/demand fundamentals remain tight due to market demand and transportation and production infrastructure limitations in most countries. Metallurgical coal is generally selling at a significant premium to steam coal. We expect our recently acquired Australian operations, which produce primarily metallurgical coal, to further enable us to capitalize on the strong global coal markets. In the United States, we expect coal demand to remain strong in 2005, assuming continued economic strength, normal weather, and available transportation for coal. Strong demand for coal and coal based electricity generation is being driven by the strengthening economy, low customer stockpiles, production difficulties for some producers, capacity constraints of nuclear generation and high prices of natural gas and oil. The high price of natural gas is leading coal fueled generating plants to operate at increasing levels. We expect that high costs and unpredictable supplies of oil and natural gas are likely to remain for the foreseeable future. Current average inventories at U.S. generators are estimated to be below five year averages and coal fueled electricity generation is expected to increase to record levels. Generation from nuclear power is currently constrained by capacity. We expect the Powder River Basin to remain the largest and fastest growing region in the United States for coal production due to its abundant coal reserves, low sulfur content and low mining costs. Year to year fluctuations in demand will occur based on weather and the strength of the economy. A 49 Table of Contents number of customers plan test burns and increased use of blending to reduce the supply/demand imbalance of Central Appalachian coals. Strong demand is also expected for coals from Colorado, the Midwest and Northern Appalachia. We are targeting 2005 production of 210 million to 220 million tons and total sales volume of 240 million to 250 million tons, including 12 to 14 million tons of metallurgical coal. Over 95% of our total production in 2005 has been priced (including 90% of our metallurgical coal production). Management expects strong market conditions and operating performance to overcome external cost pressures and adverse rail and port performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs. In addition, historically low interest rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities Our subsidiaries have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs, workers compensation obligations and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 for these liabilities totaled $146.0 million, while payments were $194.2 million, including a $50.0 million voluntary pre funding of one pension plan. Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injury and illness obligations. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. 50 Table of Contents Health care cost trend rate (dollars in thousands): One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 7,960 $ (5,462 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 138,793 $ (116,488 ) Discount rate (dollars in thousands): One Half One Half Percentage Point Percentage Point Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 987 $ (1,150 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (65,051 ) $ 71,496 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.43 years at December 31, 2004. Asset Retirement Obligations Our method for accounting for reclamation activities changed on January 1, 2003 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates related to surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. The asset retirement obligation is determined by mine and we use various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the revisions to the obligation and asset are recognized at the appropriate credit adjusted risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $42.4 million, and payments totaled $45.8 million. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal in over the counter markets. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal and emission allowance positions. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Ninety nine percent of the contracts in our trading portfolio as of December 31, 2004 were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials, and one percent of our contracts were valued based on similar market transactions. As of December 31, 2004, one hundred percent of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2005. 51 Table of Contents Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future book and taxable income trends, available tax planning strategies and the overall deferred tax position. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest, as considered appropriate by management. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 98% of our revenue in 2004 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these agreements, risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and debt and equity offerings related to significant transactions. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs, costs related to past mining obligations and planned acquisitions and development activities. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above, in excess of the primary uses. We typically fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations, and during 2004 and 2003 have had no borrowings outstanding under our $900.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which we use primarily for standby letters of credit. This provides us with available borrowing capacity ($554.1 million as of December 31, 2004) to use to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs. Operating activities provided $283.8 million of cash in 2004, an increase of $94.9 million compared with prior year. A $136.7 million increase in net income from continuing operations was the primary contributor to the improvement. Partially offsetting this increase was higher pension plan funding of 52 Table of Contents $44.6 million. During the second quarter of 2004, we electively funded $50.0 million to one pension plan, the remaining $12.1 million of current year pension funding was toward minimum funding obligations for our pension plans. By contrast, contributions were $17.5 million in the prior year, $9.9 million of which was voluntary. Net cash used in investing activities was $705.0 million in 2004, $512.8 million more than prior year. Investment spending in 2004 includes $421.3 million for the acquisition of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado and two mines in Australia. In the prior year, we spent $90.0 million to acquire the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company. Capital spending of $266.6 million in the current year was $110.2 million more than prior year expenditures of $156.4 million. Current year spending included a large loading facility upgrade in our Powder River Basin operations, $114.7 million of initial payments related to the successful acquisition of a total of 621 million tons of Powder River Basin coal reserves, and equipment purchases in the Midwest and at Australian mines acquired during 2004. In December 2004, we acquired a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and manages the Paso Diablo mine in Venezuela, for a net purchase price of $32.5 million. Proceeds from property and equipment disposals were $30.2 million lower than prior year primarily due to the sale of oil and gas rights, land and coal reserves and surplus surface land in Appalachia in 2003, with no comparable transactions in 2004. Financing activities provided $693.4 million in 2004 compared with $48.6 million in the prior year, an increase of $644.8 million. The current year included net proceeds from our March 2004 debt and equity offerings of $627.8 million. We issued 17.65 million common shares at $22.50 per share, raising $383.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses, and $250 million from our issuance of 5.875% Senior Notes due in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed a repricing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of an amended $450 million Term Loan and a $900 million Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of the repricing, the previous term loan was extinguished and a new loan with nearly identical terms, but a lower interest rate, was issued. The previous Term Loan had been repriced during the first quarter of 2004 concurrent with a $300 million increase in capacity of the revolving loan. Additional payments on long term debt in 2004 were $36.3 million. During the first half of 2003, we refinanced our debt utilizing proceeds from long term debt of $1.1 billion to, among other things, repay line of credit borrowings of $121.6 million and long term debt of $831.0 million and to pay $23.7 million in debt issuance costs in connection with the new debt issued. The prior year included other debt repayments of $37.4 million. Securitized interest in accounts receivable increased $110.0 million in 2004 compared to a decrease of $46.4 million in the prior year. Financing cash flows in the current and prior year periods included dividends of $32.6 million and $24.1 million, respectively. A detailed discussion of our debt instruments and refinancing activity is included in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our total indebtedness consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2004 2003 Term Loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility $ 448,750 $ 446,625 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 239,525 Fair value of interest rate swaps 6.875% Senior Notes 5,189 4,239 5.0% Subordinated Notes 73,621 79,412 Other 7,880 16,263 Total $ 1,424,965 $ 1,196,539 We filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in October 2003, which was declared effective in March 2004, allowing us to offer and sell from time to time 53 Table of Contents unsecured debt securities consisting of notes, debentures, and other debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants; and or units totaling a maximum of $1.25 billion. The 2004 debt and equity offerings noted above were made under this universal shelf registration statement, which remains in effect. The shelf registration statement has a remaining capacity of $602.9 million. Related proceeds could be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of other debt, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions and any other purposes that may be stated in any prospectus supplement. As of December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We had letters of credit outstanding under the facility of $345.9 million, leaving $554.1 million available for borrowing. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, and the 5.0% Subordinated Notes as of December 31, 2004. In May 2003, we entered into and designated four interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $100.0 million as a fair value hedge of our 6.875% Senior Notes. Under the swaps, we pay a floating rate that resets each March 15 and September 15, based upon the six month LIBOR rate, for a period of ten years ending March 15, 2013 and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The average applicable floating rate of the four swaps was 5.14% as of December 31, 2004. At current LIBOR levels, we would realize annualized savings of approximately $1.7 million over the term of the swaps. In September 2003, we entered into two $400.0 million interest rate swaps. One $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2010, was designated as a hedge of changes in expected cash flows on the term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under this swap we pay a fixed rate of 6.764% and receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% (4.99% at December 31, 2004) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate. Another $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2013, was designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Under this swap, we pay a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.97% (4.46% at December 31, 2004) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The swaps will lower our overall borrowing costs on $400.0 million of debt principal by 0.64% over the term of the floating to fixed swap. This results in annual interest savings of $2.6 million over the term of the fixed to floating swap. The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 900,000 $ 900,000 In October 2004, our board of directors approved a 20% increase in the regular quarterly dividend on common stock, to $0.075 per share. 54 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Year Within After 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 95,126 $ 243,516 $ 460,966 $ 1,234,582 Capital lease obligations 892 790 38 Operating leases obligations 92,817 138,097 69,960 49,417 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 141,822 5,677 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 79,035 274,562 207,656 52,996 Other long term liabilities(2) 172,582 344,892 355,376 908,744 Total contractual cash obligations $ 582,274 $ 1,007,534 $ 1,093,996 $ 2,245,739 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We had $147.5 million of purchase obligations related to future capital expenditures at December 31, 2004. Commitments for coal reserve related expenditures, including Federal Coal Leases, are included in Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations in the table above. The contractual commitments detailed in the table above do not include expenditures related to the Federal Coal Lease bid that was won in February 2005 and the related tons are not included in our reserves. Total capital expenditures for 2005 are expected to range from $450 million to $500 million. Approximately 50% of projected 2005 capital expenditures relates to the Federal Coal Leases and longwall equipment at the Twentymile Mine and longwall replacement components in Australia, and the remainder is expected be used to purchase or develop reserves, replace or add equipment, fund cost reduction initiatives and upgrade equipment and facilities at the operations we recently acquired. We anticipate funding these capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related and reclamation liabilities included above are expected to be funded from operating cash flow, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases and coal reserves. We believe the risk of generating lower than anticipated operating cash flow in 2005 is reduced by our high level of sales commitments (over 95% of 2005 planned production), improved pricing and ongoing efforts to improve our operating cost structure. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. 55 Table of Contents We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in millions): Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total Self Bonding $ 653.3 $ $ $ $ $ 653.3 Surety Bonds 294.5 134.3 91.7 27.6 548.1 Letters of Credit 0.4 25.1 72.9 120.1 130.7 349.2 $ 948.2 $ 159.4 $ 164.6 $ 120.1 $ 158.3 $ 1,550.6 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and collateral for surety companies. We have guaranteed $9.2 million of debt of an affiliate in which we have a 49% equity investment, as described in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Our remaining guarantees and indemnifications are discussed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. In March 2000, we established an accounts receivable securitization program. Under the program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to the Seller are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We used proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable in lieu of drawing down on our revolving credit facility or to repay long term debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. On September 16, 2004, we and our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary closed on an expansion of the accounts receivable securitization facility. Under the terms of the amended agreement, the total facility capacity was increased from $140 million to $225 million and the receivables of additional wholly owned subsidiaries of ours are now eligible to participate in the facility. The maturity of the facility was also extended to September 2009. All other terms and conditions remain substantially unchanged. The funding cost of the securitization program was $1.7 million and $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, the securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from our consolidated balance sheet. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit were $200.0 million and $90.0 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A detailed description of our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization is included in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS No. 123(R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005 (for calendar year companies), and we expect to adopt the standard on that date, using one of the two methods permitted by SFAS No. 123(R), described below: A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments 56 Table of Contents granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. Had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The precise impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on us in 2005 and beyond cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of equity based compensation granted in the future. However, because we make our annual equity based compensation grants in January, prior to the issuance of our financial statements, an estimate of the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on 2005 net income can be made. Based on stock option grants made in January 2005, considering option grants outstanding in 2005 made prior to 2005, and assuming no additional stock option grants in 2005 beyond January 2005, we anticipate (assuming the modified prospective method is used) recognizing expense for stock options for the period from July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005 of $2.3 million, net of taxes. It should be noted that annual equity based compensation grants in years prior to 2005 consisted of a higher number of stock options than the grant made in 2005. For the January 2005 grant, we delivered comparable equity based compensation value by granting a combination of stock options and restricted stock. Prior to January 2005, we had not previously granted restricted stock as part of our annual compensation strategy. Expense related to restricted stock (which vests over five years, and assuming no grants beyond January 2005) is anticipated to be approximately $0.8 million, net of taxes, in 2005. Risks Relating to Our Company If a substantial portion of our long term coal supply agreements terminate, our revenues and operating profits could suffer if we were unable to find alternate buyers willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms to those in our contracts. A substantial portion of our sales is made under coal supply agreements, which are important to the stability and profitability of our operations. The execution of a satisfactory coal supply agreement is frequently the basis on which we undertake the development of coal reserves required to be supplied under the contract. For the year ended December 31, 2004, 90% of our sales volume was sold under long term coal supply agreements. At December 31, 2004, our coal supply agreements had remaining terms ranging from one to 17 years and an average volume weighted remaining term of approximately 3.4 years. Many of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that permit the parties to adjust the contract price upward or downward at specified times. We may adjust these contract prices based on inflation or deflation and or changes in the factors affecting the cost of producing coal, such as taxes, fees, royalties and changes in the laws regulating the mining, production, sale or use of coal. In a limited number of contracts, failure of the parties to agree on a price under those provisions may allow either party to terminate the contract. We sometimes experience a reduction in coal prices in new long term coal supply agreements replacing some of our expiring contracts. Coal supply agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during the duration of specified events beyond the control of the affected party. Most coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as Btu, sulfur content, ash content, grindability and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications 57 Table of Contents could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts. Moreover, some of these agreements permit the customer to terminate the contract if transportation costs, which our customers typically bear, increase substantially. In addition, some of these contracts allow our customers to terminate their contracts in the event of changes in regulations affecting our industry that increase the price of coal beyond specified limits. The operating profits we realize from coal sold under supply agreements depend on a variety of factors. In addition, price adjustment and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility provided by those contracts. If a substantial portion of our coal supply agreements were modified or terminated, we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to find alternate buyers for our coal at the same level of profitability. Market prices for coal decreased in most regions in 2002. In 2003, pricing improved for eastern coal regions and moved slightly higher for western coal regions, and in 2004 pricing was substantially higher for the eastern coal regions and slightly higher for western coal regions. As a result, we cannot predict the future strength of the coal market and cannot assure you that we will be able to replace existing long term coal supply agreements at the same prices or with similar profit margins when they expire. In addition, two of our largest coal supply agreements are the subject of ongoing litigation and arbitration. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we derived 25% of our total coal revenues from sales to our five largest customers. At December 31, 2004, we had 45 coal supply agreements with these customers expiring at various times from 2005 to 2011. We are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long term agreements with some of these customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and those customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long term coal supply agreements. If a number of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially. Peabody Western has a long term coal supply agreement with the owners of the Mohave Generating Station that expires on December 31, 2005. Southern California Edison (the majority owner and operator of the plant) is involved in a California Public Utilities Commission proceeding related to the operation of the Mohave plant beyond 2005 or the temporary or permanent shutdown of the plant. In a July 2003 filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, the operator affirmed that the Mohave plant was not forecast to return to service as a coal fueled resource until mid 2009 at the earliest if the plant is shutdown at December 31, 2005. Southern California Edison has subsequently reaffirmed this forecast to the Commission. On December 2, 2004, the California Public Utilities Commission issued an opinion authorizing Southern California Edison to make necessary expenditures at the Mohave plant to preserve the Mohave open option while Southern California Edison continues to seek resolution of the water and coal issues. The opinion stated that its goal was to return the Mohave plant to service with as short of a shut down period as possible. There is a dispute with the Hopi Tribe regarding the use of groundwater in the transportation of the coal by pipeline from Peabody Westerns Black Mesa Mine to the Mohave plant. As a part of the alternate dispute resolution referenced in the Navajo Nation litigation, Peabody Western has been negotiating with the owners of the Mohave Generating Station and the Navajo Generating Station, and the two tribes to resolve the complex issues surrounding the groundwater dispute and other disputes involving the two generating stations. Resolution of these issues is critical to the continuation of the operation of the Mohave Generating Station and the renewal of the coal supply agreement after December 31, 2005. There is no assurance that the issues critical to the continued operation of the Mohave plant will be resolved. If these issues are not resolved in a timely manner, the operation of the Mohave plant will cease or be suspended on December 31, 2005. Absent a satisfactory alternate dispute resolution, it is unlikely that the coal supply agreement for the Mohave plant will be renewed in time to avoid a shutdown of the mine in 2006. The Mohave plant is the sole customer of the Black Mesa Mine, 58 Table of Contents which sold 4.7 million tons in 2004. In 2004, the mine generated $25.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA, which represents 4.5% of our total of $559.2 million. Our financial performance could be adversely affected by our substantial debt. Our financial performance could be affected by our substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2004, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,425.0 million, and we had $554.1 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to: making it more difficult for us to pay interest and satisfy our debt obligations; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of the cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate uses; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the coal industry; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors. In addition, our indebtedness subjects us to financial and other restrictive covenants. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, substantially all of our assets secure our indebtedness under our credit facility. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of sufficient operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. The credit facility and the indenture governing the notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. If transportation for our coal becomes unavailable or uneconomic for our customers, our ability to sell coal could suffer. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customers purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy or could make some of our operations less competitive than other sources of coal. Certain coal supply agreements, which account for less than 5% of our tons sold, permit the customer to terminate the contract if the cost of transportation increases by an amount ranging from 10% to 20% in any given 12 month period. Coal producers depend upon rail, barge, trucking, overland conveyor, pipeline and ocean going vessels to deliver coal to markets. While our coal customers typically arrange and pay for transportation of coal from the mine or port to the point of use, disruption of these transportation services because of weather related problems, strikes, lock outs, transportation delays or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to our customers and thus could adversely affect our results of operations. For 59 Table of Contents example, the high volume of coal shipped from all Powder River Basin mines could create temporary congestion on the rail systems servicing that region. Continued increases in coal demand, combined with many customers inventories that are lower than historical averages, created periodic regional rail and port congestion in 2004. To the extent rail or port congestion constrains our operations ability to successfully ship coal to our customers, our operating results will be reduced. Risks inherent to mining could increase the cost of operating our business. Our mining operations are subject to conditions beyond our control that can delay coal deliveries or increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time. These conditions include weather and natural disasters, unexpected maintenance problems, key equipment failures, variations in coal seam thickness, variations in the amount of rock and soil overlying the coal deposit, variations in rock and other natural materials and variations in geologic conditions. Our mining operations are extensively regulated, which imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal. Federal, state and local authorities regulate the coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. In addition, significant legislation mandating specified benefits for retired coal miners affects our industry. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment. The costs, liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production. The possibility exists that new legislation and or regulations and orders may be adopted that may materially adversely affect our mining operations, our cost structure and or our customers ability to use coal. New legislation or administrative regulations (or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations), including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs. The majority of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchasers plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use. These factors and legislation, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the United States and over 160 other nations are signatories to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is intended to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. In December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, the signatories to the convention established a binding set of emission targets for developed nations, which took effect in February 2005. Although the specific emission targets vary from country to country, the United States would be required to reduce emissions to 93% of 1990 levels over a five year budget period from 2008 through 2012. Although the United States has not ratified the emission targets and no comprehensive regulations focusing on greenhouse gas emissions are in place, these restrictions, whether through ratification of the emission targets or other efforts to stabilize or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, could adversely affect the price and demand for coal. According to the Department of Energys Energy Information Administration Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2003, coal accounts for 31% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions could result in reduced use of coal if electricity generators switch to lower carbon sources of fuel. Further developments in connection with regulations or other limits on carbon dioxide emissions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 60 Table of Contents Our expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. We provide postretirement health and life insurance benefits to eligible union and non union employees. We calculated the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, which we estimate had a present value of $1,020.8 million as of December 31, 2004, $81.3 million of which was a current liability. We have estimated these unfunded obligations based on assumptions described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially higher. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligations to provide these or additional benefits. We are party to an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or the PBGC, and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make specified contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States). As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries participate in two defined benefit multi employer pension funds that were established as a result of collective bargaining with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) pursuant to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement as periodically negotiated. The UMWA 1950 Pension Plan provides pension and disability pension benefits to qualifying represented employees retiring from a participating employer where the employee last worked prior to January 1, 1976. This is a closed group of beneficiaries with no new entrants. The UMWA 1974 Pension Plan provides pension and disability pension benefits to qualifying represented employees retiring from a participating employer where the employee last worked after December 31, 1975. Contributions to these funds could increase as a result of future collective bargaining with the United Mine Workers of America, a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency of other coal companies who currently contribute to these funds, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets, higher medical and drug costs or other funding deficiencies. The United Mine Workers of America Combined Fund was created by federal law in 1992. This multi employer fund provides health care benefits to a closed group of our retired former employees who last worked prior to 1976, as well as orphaned beneficiaries of out of business companies who were receiving benefits as orphans prior to the 1992 law; no new retirees will be added to this group. The liability is subject to increases or decreases in per capita health care costs, offset by the mortality curve in this aging population of beneficiaries. Another fund, the 1992 Benefit Plan also created by the same federal law in 1992 provides benefits to qualifying retired former employees of companies who have gone out of business and have defaulted in providing their former employees with retiree medical benefits. Beneficiaries continue to be added to this fund as employers go out of business, but the overall exposure for new beneficiaries into this fund is limited to retirees covered under their employers plan who retired prior to October 1, 1994. Another fund, the 1993 Benefit Fund was established through collective bargaining and provides retiree medical benefits to qualifying retired former employees who retired after September 30, 1994 of certain signatory companies who have gone out of business and have defaulted in providing their former employees with retiree medical benefits. Beneficiaries continue to be added to this fund as employers go out of business. 61 Table of Contents Based upon the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, we assumed future cash savings which allowed us to reduce our projected post retirement benefit obligations and related expense. Failure to achieve these assumed future savings under all benefit plans could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Our future success depends upon our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves that are economically recoverable. Our recoverable reserves decline as we produce coal. We have not yet applied for the permits required or developed the mines necessary to use all of our reserves. Furthermore, we may not be able to mine all of our reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations. Our future success depends upon our conducting successful exploration and development activities or acquiring properties containing economically recoverable reserves. Our current strategy includes increasing our reserves through acquisitions of government and other leases and producing properties and continuing to use our existing properties. The federal government also leases natural gas and coalbed methane reserves in the West, including in the Powder River Basin. Some of these natural gas and coalbed methane reserves are located on, or adjacent to, some of our Powder River Basin reserves, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and lessees of those interests. Other lessees rights relating to these mineral interests could prevent, delay or increase the cost of developing our coal reserves. These lessees may also seek damages from us based on claims that our coal mining operations impair their interests. Additionally, the federal government limits the amount of federal land that may be leased by any company to 150,000 acres nationwide. As of December 31, 2004, we leased a total of 60,140 acres from the federal government and added an additional 17,598 through February 2005. The limit could restrict our ability to lease additional federal lands. For additional discussion of our federal leases see Item 2. Properties of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Our planned mine development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have continuing success developing additional mines. Most of our mining operations are conducted on properties owned or leased by us. Because title to most of our leased properties and mineral rights are not thoroughly verified until a permit to mine the property is obtained, our right to mine some of our reserves may be materially adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist. In addition, in order to develop our reserves, we must receive various governmental permits. We cannot predict whether we will continue to receive the permits necessary for us to operate profitably in the future. We may not be able to negotiate new leases from the government or from private parties or obtain mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interest in properties on which mining operations are not commenced during the term of the lease. From time to time, we have experienced litigation with lessors of our coal properties and with royalty holders. A decrease in the production of our metallurgical coal (or other high margin products) or a decrease in the price of metallurgical coal (or other high margin products) could decrease our anticipated profitability. We more than doubled our sales of metallurgical coal in 2004, primarily as a result of the acquisition of coal operations in Australia in April 2004. Our current annual capacity for metallurgical coal production is approximately 12 to 14 million tons. Prices for metallurgical coal in late 2004 and early 2005 have reached historically high levels. We have committed 90% of our projected 2005 metallurgical coal production at significantly higher prices than in the past. As a result, our projected margins from these sales have increased significantly, and will represent a larger percentage of our overall revenues and profits in 2005. To the extent we experience either production or transportation difficulties that impair our ability to ship metallurgical coal to our customers at anticipated levels, our profitability will be reduced in 2005. After 2005, we have metallurgical coal production that has not yet been priced. As a result, a decrease in metallurgical coal prices could decrease our profitability beyond 2005. 62 Table of Contents An inability of contract miner or brokerage sources to fulfill the delivery terms of their contracts with us could reduce our profitability. In conducting our trading, brokerage and mining operations, we utilize third party sources of coal production, including contract miners and brokerage sources, to fulfill deliveries under our coal supply agreements. Our profitability or exposure to loss on transactions or relationships such as these is dependent upon the reliability (including financial viability) and price of the third party supply, our obligation to supply coal to customers in the event that adverse geologic mining conditions restrict deliveries from our suppliers, our willingness to participate in temporary cost increases experienced by our third party coal suppliers, our ability to pass on temporary cost increases to our customers, the ability to substitute, when economical, third party coal sources with internal production or coal purchased in the market, and other factors. If the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future, our profitability could be impaired. During the mid 1970s and early 1980s, a growing coal market and increased demand for coal attracted new investors to the coal industry, spurred the development of new mines and resulted in added production capacity throughout the industry, all of which led to increased competition and lower coal prices. Similarly, continued increases in future coal prices could encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers. Any overcapacity could reduce coal prices in the future. We could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations. As of December 31, 2004, we and our subsidiaries had approximately 7,900 employees. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 40% of our hourly employees were represented by unions and they generated 21% of our 2004 coal production. Relations with our employees, and where applicable, organized labor, are important to our success. United States The United Mine Workers of America represented approximately 30% of our hourly employees, who generated 16% of our production during the year ended December 31, 2004. An additional 6% of our hourly employees are represented by labor unions other than the United Mine Workers of America. These employees generated 2% of our production during the year ended December 31, 2004. Hourly workers at our mines in Arizona and one of our mines in Colorado are represented by the United Mine Workers of America under the Western Surface Agreement, which was ratified in 2000 and is effective through September 1, 2005. Our union labor east of the Mississippi River is primarily represented by the United Mine Workers of America and the majority of union mines are subject to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement. The current five year labor agreement was ratified in December 2001 and is effective through December 31, 2006. Australia The Australian coal mining industry is highly unionized and the majority of workers employed at our Australian Mining Operations are members of trade unions. These employees are represented by three unions: the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), which represents the production employees, and two unions that represent the other staff. Our Australian employees are approximately 4% of our entire workforce and generated 3% of our total production in the year ended December 31, 2004. The miners at Wilkie Creek operate under a labor agreement that expires in June 2006. The miners at Burton operate under a labor agreement that is currently under negotiation. The miners at North Goonyella operate under a labor agreement which expires in March 2008. The miners at Eaglefield operate under a labor agreement that expires in May 2007. 63 Table of Contents Because of the higher labor costs and the increased risk of strikes and other work related stoppages that may be associated with union operations in the coal industry, our competitors who operate without union labor may have a competitive advantage in areas where they compete with our unionized operations. If some or all of our current non union operations were to become unionized, we could incur an increased risk of work stoppages, reduced productivity and higher labor costs. The 10 month United Mine Workers of America strike in 1993 had a material adverse effect on us. Our operations could be adversely affected if we fail to appropriately secure our obligations. U.S. federal and state laws and Australian laws require us to secure certain of our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers compensation, to secure coal lease obligations and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. The primary method for us to meet those obligations is to post a corporate guarantee (i.e. self bond) or to provide a third party surety bond. As of December 31, 2004, we had $653.3 million of self bonds in place for our reclamation obligations. As of December 31, 2004, we also had outstanding surety bonds with third parties for post mining reclamation totaling $294.5 million. We had an additional $91.7 million of surety bonds in place for workers compensation obligations and $134.3 million of surety bonds securing coal leases. All other bonding, including performance and infrastructure bonds, totaled $27.6 million. These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis. It has become increasingly difficult for us to secure new surety bonds or renew bonds without the posting of partial collateral. Surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals. Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or to provide a suitable alternatives would have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including the following: lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds; restrictions on the availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of our indenture or new credit facility; and the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety. Our ability to self bond reduces our costs of providing financial assurances. To the extent we are unable to maintain our current level of self bonding, due to legislative or regulatory changes or changes in our financial condition, our costs would increase. Our ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or fail to attract qualified personnel. We manage our business with a number of key personnel, the loss of a number of whom could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, as our business develops and expands, we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. We do not have key person life insurance to cover our executive officers. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks and threats, escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is affected by general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending, and market liquidity, which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control, such as terrorist attacks and acts of war. Future terrorist attacks against U.S. targets, rumors or threats of war, actual conflicts involving the United States or its allies, or military or trade disruptions affecting our customers may materially adversely affect our operations. As a result, there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to 64 Table of Contents our customers, decreased sales of our coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from our customers. Strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the United States. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government imposed price controls. It is possible that any, or a combination, of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness deteriorates. Our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. Our customer base is changing with deregulation as utilities sell their power plants to their non regulated affiliates or third parties. These new power plant owners or other customers may have credit ratings that are below investment grade. If deterioration of the creditworthiness of our customers occurs, our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected. Our certificate of incorporation and by laws include provisions that may discourage a takeover attempt. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our by laws and certificate of incorporation impose various procedural and other requirements that could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, a change of control of our company may be delayed or deterred as a result of the stockholders rights plan adopted by our board of directors. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal trading, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes, and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options, and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps at December 31, 2004 and included forwards, futures and options at December 31, 2003. Our policy for accounting for coal trading activities is described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation 65 Table of Contents period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both option and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.5 million, $6.1 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.4 million, $3.2 million, and $1.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, one hundred percent of the value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2005. We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. In the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2005 involves hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2004, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flows hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling $515.0 million of which $285.0 million, $170.0 million and $60.0 million will expire in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Our current expectation for 2005 non capital, Australian dollar denominated cash expenditures is approximately $600 million. A change in the Australian dollar/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of US$0.01 66 Table of Contents (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of $6.0 million per year. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2004, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $872.9 million of fixed rate borrowings and $552.1 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $5.5 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $60.7 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2004 and 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we had sales commitments for over 95% of our 2005 production, leaving 5 to 10 million tons unpriced. Also as of December 31, 2005, we had 65 to 75 million tons and 130 to 140 million tons of expected production available for sale or repricing at market prices for 2006 and 2007, respectively. We have an annual metallurgical coal production capacity of 12 to 14 million tons, all of which is priced for 2005 and none of which is priced beyond March 2006. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. In addition, we utilize derivative contracts to hedge our commodity price exposure. As of December 31, 2004, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel. Notional amounts outstanding under these contracts, scheduled to expire through 2007, were 76.7 million gallons of heating oil and 28.7 million gallons of crude oil. Overall, we have fixed prices for approximately 90% of our anticipated diesel fuel requirements in 2005. We expect to consume approximately 95 million gallons of fuel per year. Based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of approximately $1 million per year.
