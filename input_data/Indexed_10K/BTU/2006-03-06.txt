Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Stock Split On February 22, 2006, we effected a two for one stock split on all shares of our common stock. Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2006, received a dividend of one share of stock for every share held. The stock began trading ex split on February 23, 2006. On March 30, 2005, we effected a two for one stock split on all shares of our common stock. Shareholders of record at the close of business on March 16, 2005 received a dividend of one share of stock for every share held. The stock 46 Table of Contents began trading ex split on March 31, 2005. All share and per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form 10 K reflect both two for one stock splits. Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected financial and other data about us for the most recent five fiscal years. The following table and the discussion of our results of operations in 2005 and 2004 in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. On April 15, 2004, we acquired three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the results of operations of the two mines in Queensland, Australia and the results of operations of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado from the April 15, 2004 purchase date. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 include early debt extinguishment costs of $53.5 million pursuant to our debt refinancing in the first half of 2003. In addition, results included expense relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of EITF No. 98 10. These accounting changes are further discussed in Note 7 to our financial statements. In July 2001, we changed our fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31. The change was first effective with respect to the nine months ended December 31, 2001. In anticipation of the sale of Citizens Power, which occurred in August 2000, we classified Citizens Power as a discontinued operation as of March 31, 2000. Results in 2004 include a $2.8 million loss, net of taxes, from discontinued operations related to the settlement of a Citizens Power indemnification claim. Citizens Power is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. We have derived the selected historical financial data for the years ended and as of December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and the nine months ended and as of December 31, 2001 from our audited financial statements. All share and per share amounts included in the following consolidated financial data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the two for one stock splits, effective February 22, 2006, and March 30, 2005. You should read the following table in conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 47 Table of Contents The results of operations for the historical periods included in the following table are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 34 active coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions and internationally in Australia. In 2005, we sold 239.9 million tons of coal that accounted for an estimated 21.5% of all U.S. coal sales, and were more than 69% greater than the sales of our closest domestic competitor and 49% more than our closest international competitor. Based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, demand for coal in the United States was more than 1.1 billion tons in 2005. Domestic consumption of coal is expected to grow at a rate of 1.7% per year through 2030 when U.S. coal demand is forecasted to be 1.8 billion tons. The EIA expects demand for coal use at coal to liquids (CTL) plants to grow to 190 million tons by 2030. Coal fueled generation is used in most cases to meet baseload electricity requirements, and coal use generally grows at the approximate rate of electricity growth, which is expected to average 1.6% annually through 2025. Coal production from west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth as Western production increases to a 63% share of total production in 2030. In 2004, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 51%, a share that the EIA projects will grow to 57% by 2030. Our primary customers are U.S. utilities, which accounted for 87% of our sales in 2005. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2005, approximately 90% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2005, our unpriced volumes for 2006 were 15 to 25 million tons on expected production of 230 to 240 million tons and total sales of 255 to 265 million tons. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risks Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity 49 Table of Contents generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Eastern U.S. Mining, Western U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Appalachia and Midwest operations, and our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. The principal business of the Western U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. The principal business of the Eastern U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities, as well as the mining of some metallurgical coal, sold to steel and coke producers. Geologically, Eastern operations mine bituminous and Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Our Australian Mining operations consist of our North Goonyella underground mine and our Wilkie Creek, Burton and Eaglefield surface mines. Eaglefield is a surface operation adjacent to, and fulfilling contract tonnages in conjunction with, the North Goonyella underground mine. In the first quarter of 2006, we will begin production at the 0.6 million ton per year Baralaba Mine, of which we own a 62.5% interest. The Baralaba Mine will produce PCI, a substitute for metallurgical coal, and steam coal. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining low sulfur, high Btu coal sold to an international customer base. Primarily, metallurgical coal is produced from our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 5% of our total sales volume and approximately 2% of U.S. sales volume. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 6 to 8 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. Each of our mining operations is described in Item 1 of this report. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 85% of revenues in 2005, we also generate revenues from brokering and trading coal (15% of revenues), and by creating value from our vast natural resource position by selling non core land holdings and mineral interests to generate additional cash flows as well as other ventures described below. We continue to pursue the development of coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. The projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to equity partner, contract miner or coal lessor. The projects we are currently pursuing are as follows: the 1,500 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in Washington County, Illinois; the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky; and the 300 megawatt Mustang Energy Project near Grants, New Mexico. The plants, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. The first of these plants would not be operational earlier than mid 2010. In February 2005, a group of Midwest rural electric cooperatives and municipal joint action agencies entered into definitive agreements to acquire 47% of the Prairie State Energy Campus project. After an initial appeal, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency reissued the air permit on April 28, 2005. The same parties who filed the earlier permit challenge filed a new appeal on June 8, 2005. We believe the permit was appropriately issued and expect to prevail in the appeal process. Various other required permits 50 Table of Contents are in process and may also be subject to challenge. If successfully completed, the Prairie State Energy Campus project would utilize approximately six million tons of coal each year. During 2005, we engaged in several BTU conversion projects which are designed to expand the uses of coal through various technologies. We are a founding member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non profit company that is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy to facilitate the design, construction and operation of the worlds first near zero emission coal fueled power plant. FutureGen will demonstrate advanced coal based technologies to generate electricity and also produce hydrogen to power fuel cells for transportation and other energy needs. The technology also will integrate the capture of carbon emissions with carbon sequestration, helping to address the issue of climate change as energy demand continues to grow worldwide. We also entered into an agreement to acquire a 30% interest in Econo Power International Corporation (EPICtm), which owns and markets modular coal gasifiers for industrial applications. The EPIC Clean Coal Gasification Systemtm uses air blown gasifiers to convert coal into a synthetic gas that is ideal for industrial applications. In late 2005, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC to advance project development of a commercial scale coal gasification project in Illinois that would transform coal into pipeline quality synthetic natural gas. The initial project would be designed with ConocoPhillips E Gastm Technology. When completed, the plant would be one of the largest coal to natural gas plants in the United States and would require at least three million tons of Illinois Basin coal per year to fuel two gasifier trains that could produce more than 35 billion cubic feet of synthetic natural gas. Effective January 1, 2006, Gregory H. Boyce became our President and Chief Executive Officer after we completed an orderly succession planning process. Irl F. Engelhardt, our former Chief Executive Officer, remains employed as Chairman of the Board. Effective March 1, 2005, Mr. Boyce was also elected to the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board. Effective March 30, 2005, we implemented a two for one stock split on all shares of our common stock. Subsequently, on February 22, 2006, we implemented another two for one stock split on all shares of our then outstanding common stock. All share and per share amounts in this annual report on Form 10 K reflect both stock splits. During July 2005, we increased our quarterly dividend 27% to $0.0475 per share and our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. On January 23, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 26% increase in our dividend, to $0.06 per share, to shareholders of record on February 7, 2006. In July 2005, the Board of Directors elected John F. Turner as an independent director who serves on the Boards Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Turner is former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) within the State Department and is the past President and Chief Executive Officer of the Conservation Fund, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to public private partnerships to protect land and water resources. He has also served as the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with responsibility for increasing wetland protection and establishing 55 National Wildlife Refuges, the most of any administration in the nations history. Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations in 2005 and 2004 below includes references to, and analysis of, our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable 51 Table of Contents measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 27 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Summary Our 2005 revenues of $4.64 billion increased 27.9% over the prior year. Revenues were driven higher by improved pricing in all of our mining operations and another year of industry record sales volume with 239.9 million tons sold compared to 227.2 million tons in 2004. For the year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion was a 39.5% increase over the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in the current year due to increases in sales volumes and prices at our U.S. and Australian Mining Operations. Results in our Western U.S. Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado. Results in our Australian Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Burton and North Goonyella Mines as well as the opening of the Eaglefield Mine adjacent to the North Goonyella Mine in the fourth quarter of 2004. Our Corporate and Other segment includes results from our December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. In addition, higher gains on property transactions contributed to higher year over year results. Net income was $422.7 million in 2005, or $1.58 per share, an increase of 141.0% over 2004 net income of $175.4 million, or $0.69 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended Increase December 31, (Decrease) 2005 2004 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 154.3 142.2 12.1 8.5 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 52.5 51.7 0.8 1.5 % Australian Mining Operations 8.3 6.1 2.2 36.1 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 24.8 27.2 (2.4 ) (8.8 )% Total 239.9 227.2 12.7 5.6 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Increase Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 4,545,323 $ 3,545,027 $ 1,000,296 28.2 % Other revenues 99,130 86,555 12,575 14.5 % Total revenues $ 4,644,453 $ 3,631,582 $ 1,012,871 27.9 % Our revenues increased by $1.01 billion, or 27.9%, to $4.64 billion compared to prior year. The three mines we acquired in the second quarter of 2004 contributed $365.2 million of revenue growth due to the additional 105 days of operations in 2005 compared to the prior year. The remaining $647.7 million 52 Table of Contents of revenue growth was driven by higher sales prices and volumes across all mining segments and improved volumes in our brokerage operations. Sales increased 28.2% to $4.55 billion in 2005, reflecting increases in every operating segment. Western U.S. Mining sales increased $222.2 million, Eastern U.S. Mining sales were $224.0 million higher, sales in Australia Mining improved $328.0 million and sales from our brokerage operations increased $226.0 million. Sales in every segment increased on improved pricing, and volumes were higher in every segment other than Trading and Brokerage. Our average sales price per ton increased 17.4% during 2005 due to increased demand for all of our coal products, which drove pricing higher, particularly in the regions where we produce metallurgical coal. Prices for metallurgical coal and our ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal have been the subject of increasing demand. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. We sell ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal from our Western U.S. Mining operations. The sales mix also improved due to an increase in sales from our Australian Mining segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets due primarily to a higher proportion of metallurgical coal production in the Australian segment sales mix. The increase in Eastern U.S. Mining operations sales was primarily due to improved pricing for both steam and metallurgical coal from the region. Sales in Appalachia increased $118.6 million, or 17.1% and sales in the Midwest increased $105.4 million, or 13.6%. On average, prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased 14.1% to $33.10 per ton. Production increases in the Midwest were partially offset by lower production in Appalachia compared to the prior year. Most of the decrease in production in Appalachia occurred during the fourth quarter as our largest metallurgical coal mine worked to develop a new section and relocate its longwall. Sales increased in our Western U.S. Mining operations due to higher demand driven volumes and prices. Overall, prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased 6.6% to $10.45 per ton. In the West, sales increased the most in the Powder River Basin, which improved $149.8 million due to increased sales prices and volumes. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of increasingly strong demand for the mines low sulfur product, which continues to expand its market area geographically. Powder River Basin operations were able to ship record volumes during 2005 by overcoming train derailments and weather and track maintenance disruptions on the main shipping line out of the basin. Our Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, helped our Colorado operations contribute an additional $67.3 million to sales compared to prior year due to an additional four months of ownership, higher prices and increased mine productivity. Sales from our Southwestern operations, where the Black Mesa Mine closed at the end of 2005, were comparable to prior year. Sales from our Australian Mining operations were $328.0 million, or 122.1%, higher than in 2004. The increase in Australian sales was due primarily to a 63.3% increase in per ton sales prices largely due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, an increase in volumes which included the opening of our Eaglefield surface mine at the end of 2004, and $197.6 million of incremental sales from the two mines we acquired in April 2004 due to 105 additional days of operations in 2005 compared to 2004. Our Trading and Brokerage operations sales increased $226.0 million in 2005 compared to prior year due to an increase in average per ton prices and higher eastern U.S. and international brokerage volumes. Other revenues increased $12.6 million, or 14.5%, compared to prior year primarily due to proceeds from a purchase contract restructuring and higher synthetic fuel revenues in the Midwest. 53 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion for 2005 was $305.5 million higher than 2004 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million, and was composed of the following: Increase to Segment Year Ended Year Ended Adjusted EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 459,039 $ 402,052 $ 56,987 14.2 % Eastern U.S. Mining 374,628 280,357 94,271 33.6 % Australian Mining 202,582 50,372 152,210 302.2 % Trading and Brokerage 43,058 41,039 2,019 4.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $57.0 million during 2005 due to a margin per ton increase of $0.15, or 5.3%, and a sales volume increase of 12.1 million tons. The Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, contributed $25.4 million more to Adjusted EBITDA in 2005 than in 2004, due to four months of incremental ownership and a 22.2% increase in per ton margin. The remaining increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by our Powder River Basin operations, which improved by $53.5 million and earned 12.3% higher per ton margins while increasing volumes 8.5% in response to greater demand for our low sulfur products. Improved revenues overcame increased unit costs that resulted from higher fuel costs, lower than anticipated volume due to rail difficulties and an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes. Improvements in the Powder River Basin and Colorado overcame a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $13.5 million for our Southwest operations primarily due to lower volume and higher fuel costs. Pricing improvements in the Powder River Basin generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $94.3 million, or 33.6%, compared to prior year primarily due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.71, or 31.5%. Our Appalachia operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $44.2 million, or 29.8%, as a result of sales price increases, partially offset by lower production at two of our mines and higher costs related to geologic issues, contract mining and roof support. Results in our Midwest operations were improved $50.1 million, or 37.9%, compared to prior year as benefits of higher volumes and prices were partially offset by higher costs due to higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs and the impact of heavy rainfall on surface operations early in the year. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $152.2 million in the current year, a 302.2% increase compared to prior year due to an increase of $16.23, or 197.4%, in margin per ton and 2.2 million additional tons shipped. Our Australian operations produce mostly (75% to 85%) high margin metallurgical coal. The two mines we acquired in April 2004 added $87.4 million to Adjusted EBITDA compared to eight months of ownership in 2004. The remaining increase of $64.8 million was primarily due to an increase in volume, including tonnage from our surface operation opened at the end of the prior year, and an increase of 63.3% in average per ton sale price. While current year margins benefited from strong sales prices, margin growth was limited by the impact of port congestion, related demurrage costs and higher costs due to geological problems at the underground mine. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.0 million from the prior year primarily due to higher brokerage results. Results in 2005 included a net charge of $4.0 million, primarily related to the breach of a coal supply contract by a producer (see Note 3). 54 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (208,909 ) (214,576 ) 5,667 2.6 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (316,114 ) (270,159 ) (45,955 ) (17.0 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (35,901 ) (42,387 ) 6,486 15.3 % Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) 1,751 n/a Interest expense (102,939 ) (96,793 ) (6,146 ) (6.3 )% Interest income 10,641 4,917 5,724 116.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interest of $426.1 million for the current year is $273.0 million, or 178.4%, higher than prior year primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Increases in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense offset improvements in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, asset retirement obligation expense, debt extinguishment costs and interest income. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our Venezuelan joint venture, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. The $5.7 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2005 compared to 2004 included: net gains on asset sales that were $77.7 million higher than prior year primarily due to a $37.4 million gain from a property exchange related to settlement of a contract dispute with a third party coal supplier (see Note 3), sales of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P. (PVR) units ($31.1 million) (see Note 11), resource sales involving non strategic coal assets and properties ($12.5 million), and an asset exchange in which we acquired Illinois Basin coal reserves ($6.2 million). The gain from PVR unit sales in 2005 was from the sale of all of our remaining 0.838 million units compared to a gain of $15.8 million on the sale of 0.775 million units in two separate transactions during 2004. All other gains on asset disposals in 2005 and 2004 were $14.3 million and $8.0 million, respectively; higher equity income of $18.7 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guassare (acquired in December 2004), which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela, and; lower net expenses related to generation development of $5.1 million, primarily due to reimbursements from the Prairie State Energy Campus partnership group. These improvements were partially offset by: a $36.0 million increase in past mining obligations expense, primarily related to higher retiree health care costs. The increase in retiree health care costs was actuarially driven by higher trend rates, and lower interest discount assumptions and higher amortization of actuarial losses in 2005, and; an increase of $46.8 million in selling and administrative expenses primarily related to accruals for higher short term and long term performance based incentive plans ($32.2 million). These incentives are principally long term plans that are driven by total shareholder returns. Our share price increased 104% during 2005, significantly outperforming industrial benchmarks and our coal 55 Table of Contents peer group average. The remaining increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to higher personnel and outside services costs needed to advance our growth initiatives in areas such as China and BTU conversion, acquisitions and regulatory costs (e.g. Sarbanes Oxley), and an increase in advertising costs related to an industry awareness campaign launched in late 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $46.0 million during 2005. Approximately 56% of the increase was due to acquisitions completed during 2004 and the remainder was from increased volumes at existing mines and operations opened during 2005. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased $6.5 million in 2005 due to additional expenses incurred in 2004 to accelerate the planned reclamation of certain closed mine sites. Interest expense increased $6.1 million primarily related to a full year of interest in 2005 on $250 million of 5.875% Senior Notes issued in late March of 2004 and increases in the cost of floating rate debt due to higher interest rates. Interest income improved $5.7 million due to higher yields on short term interest rates and an increase in invested balances due to improved cash flows during 2005. Net Income Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended Year Ended Income December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4 % Income tax benefit (provision) (960 ) 26,437 (27,397 ) (103.6 )% Minority interests (2,472 ) (1,282 ) (1,190 ) (92.8 )% Income from continuing operations 422,653 178,226 244,427 137.1 % Loss from discontinued operations (2,839 ) 2,839 n/a Net income $ 422,653 $ 175,387 $ 247,266 141.0 % Net income increased $247.3 million, or 141.0%, compared to the prior year due to the increase in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, partially offset by increases in our income tax provision. The income tax benefit in 2004 included a $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) and alternative minimum tax credits. The income tax provision in 2005 was higher based on the increase in pretax income which was partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion and the partial benefit of tax loss from a deemed liquidation of a subsidiary arising as an indirect consequence of a comprehensive and strategic internal restructuring we completed during 2005. This restructuring resulted from efforts to better align corporate ownership of subsidiaries on a geographic and functional basis. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Summary In 2004, our revenues increased to $3.63 billion, 29.0% higher than 2003, led by improved pricing and an industry record sales volume of 227.2 million tons. Mines acquired in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of sales and 11.0 million tons to our 2004 results. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for 2004 totaled $773.8 million, a 28.1% increase over $603.9 million in the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in 2004 due to increased sales volumes and prices. Net income in 2004 was $175.4 million, or $0.69 per share, an increase of 459.5% over 2003 net income of $31.3 million, or $0.14 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved operating results and acquisitions in 2004, and the impact in 2003 of $53.5 million in pretax early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes. 56 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2004 2003 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 142.2 129.6 12.6 9.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 51.7 46.3 5.4 11.7 % Australian Mining Operations 6.1 1.3 4.8 369.2 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 27.2 26.0 1.2 4.6 % Total 227.2 203.2 24.0 11.8 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Increase to Year Ended Year Ended Revenues December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 3,545,027 $ 2,729,323 $ 815,704 29.9 % Other revenues 86,555 85,973 582 0.7 % Total revenues $ 3,631,582 $ 2,815,296 $ 816,286 29.0 % Revenues increased by 29.0%, or $816.3 million, over 2003. The acquisition of three mines in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of total revenue and 11.0 million tons during the year. Excluding revenues from acquisitions during 2004, U.S. Mining revenues increased $375.4 million, and revenues from our brokerage operations increased $110.9 million on higher pricing and volume worldwide. Our average sales price per ton increased 14.6% during 2004 due to increased overall demand, which has driven pricing higher, most notably in Appalachia, and a change in sales mix. The sales mix has benefited from the increase in sales from the Australian segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets. In addition to geographic mix changes, our 2004 revenues included a greater proportion of higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Pricing of metallurgical coal responded to increased international demand for the product. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. Other revenues were relatively unchanged from 2003. In our Eastern U.S. Mining operations, revenues increased $302.8 million, or 25.3%, as a result of higher pricing and volumes from strong steam and metallurgical coal demand. Production increases at most eastern mines more than offset lower than expected production at certain of our mines and from contract sources as a result of geologic difficulties and from congestion related shipping delays and hurricane related production disruptions and delays to rail and export shipments. Appalachian revenues led the Eastern U.S. increase, benefiting the most from price increases while also increasing production and sales volumes. Revenues in Appalachia increased $188.1 million, or 37.0%, while in the Midwest, revenues increased by $114.7 million, or 16.6%. Revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $171.6 million, or 14.0%, on both increased volumes and prices. However, the primary driver of increased revenues in the West was a 12.6 million ton increase in sales volume. Growth in volumes were primarily in the Powder River Basin operations, where revenues were up $58.6 million, or 7.5%, and from the addition of the Twentymile Mine in April 2004, which added $99.0 million to sales. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of stronger demand for the mines low sulfur product, which overcame difficulties with rail service, downtime at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine to upgrade the loading facility and poor weather, which impaired production early in the year. Revenues in our Australian 57 Table of Contents Mining operations increased $241.5 million compared to 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of two operating mines during 2004 and benefiting from higher overall pricing for our products there. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million for 2004 was $169.9 million higher than 2003 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $603.9 million, and was composed of the following: Increase (Decrease) to Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 402,052 $ 356,898 $ 45,154 12.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining 280,357 198,964 81,393 40.9 % Australian Mining 50,372 2,225 48,147 2163.9 % Trading and Brokerage 41,039 45,828 (4,789 ) (10.4 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,820 $ 603,915 $ 169,905 28.1 % Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.2 million during 2004, margin per ton increased $0.07, or 2.5%, while sales volume increased 12.6 million tons. The April 2004 acquisition of the Twentymile Mine contributed to $31.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA increase and sales volume, adding 6.2 million tons of the volume increase in 2004. An increase of $20.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA in the Powder River Basin, due primarily to increases in sales volume, contributed most of the remaining improvement in the West. Our Powder River Basin operations continued to benefit from strong demand, leading to record shipping levels which overcame the effects of a planned outage earlier in the year to increase throughput at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine, rail service problems throughout the year and the shutdown of our Big Sky Mine at the end of 2003. Results in the Southwest approximated 2003 levels. Pricing improvements generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased $81.4 million, or 40.9%, compared to 2003 due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.11, or 25.8%, and an increase in volume by 5.4 million, or 11.7%. Improved pricing led to increased margins in our Eastern operations, despite higher processing costs incurred to upgrade from steam to metallurgical quality, the cost of substitute coal purchases to enable production to be sold in higher value metallurgical coal markets, hurricane related transportation and production interruption and increased fuel and steel costs. Appalachia operations drove the improvement in the East with a $101.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Appalachia region benefited from strong demand driven pricing and volume and increased higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Our operations in Appalachia also benefited during the current year from $21.0 million in insurance recoveries, more than offsetting higher costs due to equipment and geologic difficulties at a mine in Kentucky and a $9.6 million increase in earnings from our equity interest in a joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA in the Midwest was $20.1 million less than 2003 as increased production and sales, as well as higher overall sales prices, did not overcome poor geologic conditions at certain mines, higher equipment repair costs and higher fuel and steel costs. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $48.1 million in 2004. Our acquisition of two mines in April 2004 added 4.8 million tons and increased overall sales volume to 6.1 million tons. Most of the increase in sales tonnage was in higher margin metallurgical coal sales, driving a margin per ton increase of $6.55, or nearly 400%. The acquisitions in 2004 contributed $43.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA to results for the year. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.8 million from 2003 primarily due to higher brokerage results in 2003. Adjusted EBITDA from trading activities increased over 2003 due to improved pricing on our long position, and pure brokerage results improved on higher pricing and volumes, particularly in international brokerage. 58 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,820 $ 603,915 $ 169,905 28.1 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (214,576 ) (193,637 ) (20,939 ) (10.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (270,159 ) (234,336 ) (35,823 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (42,387 ) (31,156 ) (11,231 ) (36.0 )% Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) (53,513 ) 51,762 96.7 % Interest expense (96,793 ) (98,540 ) 1,747 1.8 % Interest income 4,917 4,086 831 20.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ 153,071 $ (3,181 ) $ 156,252 n/a Total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million for 2004 is compared with $603.9 million from 2003 in the discussion above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, resource management and our Venezuelan mining operations. The increase in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to: net gains on asset sales were $8.8 million higher in 2003, which included gains of $18.8 million on the sale of land, coal reserves and oil and gas rights, $6.4 million of other asset disposals, and $7.6 million from the sale of 1.15 million units of PVR, while 2004 included gains of only $8.0 million from other asset disposals and a $15.8 million gain from the sale of a total of 0.775 million units of PVR in two separate transactions; increased costs in 2004 for generation development ($5.3 million) related to the further development of the Prairie State and Thoroughbred Energy campuses; higher selling and administrative expenses of $34.5 million, primarily associated with higher long term incentive costs ($17.8 million), pensions, an increase in outside services costs (including costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the impact of acquisitions during 2004; and a $2.9 million increase in our accrual for future environmental obligations. These increased costs compared to 2003 were partially offset by the gain on sale of PVR units discussed above and: lower costs ($29.0 million) in 2004 associated with past mining obligations, primarily lower retiree health care costs from the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and lower closed and suspended mine spending; contributions ($1.2 million) to Adjusted EBITDA from the December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $35.8 million during 2004 due to higher volume and acquisitions. Asset retirement obligation expense increased $11.2 million during 2004 due to increased or accelerated reclamation work at certain closed mine sites and the acquisition of additional mining operations. 59 Table of Contents Debt extinguishment costs were $51.8 million higher in 2003 due to the significant prepayment premiums associated with the March 2003 refinancing, discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.

The tax benefit recorded in 2004 differs from the benefit in 2003 primarily as a result of significantly higher pre tax income, partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion. The 2004 tax benefit also included a net $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on those NOLs and alternative minimum tax credits. We evaluated and assessed the expected near term utilization of NOLs, book and taxable income trends, available tax strategies and the overall deferred tax position to determine the amount and timing of valuation allowance adjustments; a $2.8 million loss, net of tax, from discontinued operations in 2004 due to costs to resolve a contract indemnification claim related to our former Citizens Power subsidiary; lower minority interests during 2004 due to the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the recession of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook Events Impacting Near Term Operations Despite setting new industry records, shipments from our Powder River mines were lower than expected during 2005 due to a remedial maintenance program undertaken by the two railroad companies serving the Powder River Basin. The maintenance and repairs are expected to continue into 2006. We 60 Table of Contents expect these repairs may restrict shipments from our Powder River operations during 2006, but continue to anticipate higher shipment levels than 2005. Metallurgical coal production from our Appalachia operations is expected to be lower than prior year periods through the first quarter of 2006 as a metallurgical coal mine in our Appalachia segment continues development work and moves to new reserves. The longwall at the existing mine has depleted the final panel of available reserves in its current location and is relocating to a reserve extension in the first half of 2006. Following the longwall move, production of domestic metallurgical coal is expected to improve and finish the year with production equal to, or greater than, that of 2005. Our North Goonyella Mine in Australia has experienced difficult geologic conditions in 2005 and experienced a roof fall that interrupted production for portions of the third and fourth quarters. In the first quarter of 2006, we plan to install new longwall equipment to maximize operating performance under these adverse geologic conditions. We plan to meet our shipping commitments from this mine by supplementing its output with production from our newly opened, adjacent surface operation. In May 2005, we were notified of a reduced port allocation that is aimed at improving the loading of vessels and reducing demurrage at the main port for our Australian coal operations. Although port congestion has been reduced, high demurrage costs and unpredictable timing of vessel loading could continue to impact future results. Outlook Overview Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as growth continues in the U.S., Asia and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the third quarter of 2005 as reported by the U.S. Commerce Department, and Chinas economy grew 9.4% as published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Strong demand for coal and coal based electricity generation in the U.S. is being driven by the growing economy, low customer stockpiles, favorable weather, capacity constraints of nuclear generation and high prices of natural gas and oil. The high price of natural gas is leading some coal fueled generating plants to operate at increased levels. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that the high price of oil will lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including coal to liquids (CTL), and that coal will begin to displace natural gas fired generation of electricity, including the addition of CTL plants. At year end, U.S. electricity generator coal inventories were at the lowest level in the past five years. Demand for Powder River Basin coal is increasing, particularly for our ultra low sulfur products. The Powder River Basin represents more than half of our production, and the published reference price for high Btu, ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal has increased substantially, tripling during 2005. We control approximately 3.5 billion tons of proven and probable reserves in the Southern Powder River Basin and sold 125.7 million tons of coal from this region during the year ended December 31, 2005. Customers have indicated that demand for Powder River Basin coal could increase by 15% or more during 2006, although the railroads expect that they will be able to accommodate only about half of the expected increase in demand. Metallurgical coal continues to sell at a significant premium to steam coal and metallurgical markets remain strong as global steel production grew 6% to 7% in 2005. We expect to capitalize on the strong global market for metallurgical coal primarily through production and sales of metallurgical coal from our Appalachia operations and our Australian operations. We are targeting 2006 production of 230 million to 240 million tons and total sales volume of 255 million to 265 million tons, including 12 to 14 million tons of metallurgical coal. As of December 31, 2005, our unpriced volumes for produced tonnage for 2006 were 15 to 25 million tons. Management expects strong market conditions and operating performance to overcome external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs. In addition, historically low long term interest 61 Table of Contents rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities Our subsidiaries have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs, workers compensation obligations and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 16, 17 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, for these liabilities totaled $193.8 million, while payments were $147.1 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate (dollars in thousands): One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 8,789 $ (6,961 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 161,903 $ (135,501 ) 62 Table of Contents Discount rate (dollars in thousands): One Half One Half Percentage Point Percentage Point Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 1,183 $ (1,563 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (68,900 ) $ 75,878 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.99 years at December 31, 2005. Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $35.9 million, and payments totaled $33.6 million. See detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest, as considered appropriate by management. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Additional details regarding the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in Note 13. 63 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 98% of our revenue in 2005 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these agreements, risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessels, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal in over the counter markets. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal and emission allowance positions. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Ninety nine percent of the contracts in our trading portfolio as of December 31, 2005 were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials, and one percent of our contracts were valued based on similar market transactions. As of December 31, 2005, 76% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2006. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statement for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable through our securitization program. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as planned acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends, among other things, are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. We typically fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations, and during 2005 and 2004 we had no borrowings outstanding under our $900.0 million revolving line of credit, which we use primarily for standby letters of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities was $702.8 million in 2005, an increase of $419.0 million, or 147.6%, from 2004. The increase was primarily driven by stronger operational performance in 2005, as net income increased $247.3 million from the prior year. Also contributing to the increase was lower funding of pension plans in 2005, as we voluntarily pre funded $50.0 million in the prior year. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher working capital cash flows of $85.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $584.2 million during 2005 compared to $705.0 million used in 2004. Total capital expenditures were $643.9 million in 2005, an increase of $377.3 million over prior year. In 2005, we purchased mining and related assets of $141.2 million, which included $56.5 million for 64 Table of Contents the acquisition of coal reserves in Illinois and Indiana along with surface property and equipment and $84.7 million for the acquisition of mining and transportation infrastructure in the Powder River Basin. Our $118.4 million in federal coal lease expenditures in 2005 were similar to the 2004 expenditures. Other capital expenditures of $384.3 million were $232.4 million higher than the prior year. The 2005 other capital expenditures included the longwall equipment and mine development at our Australian mines, longwall replacement at our Twentymile mine, the opening of new mines and upgrading of existing mines in the Midwest and Appalachia, and expansion equipment. In 2005, we were able to make several acquisitions of strategic coal reserves and mining assets due to the strong operating results that we experienced in 2005. Proceeds from the disposal of assets increased $36.9 million primarily due to higher proceeds in 2005 from the sale of PVR units and non strategic property, reserves and equipment. In 2004, we acquired the Twentymile mine in Colorado and two mines in Australia for $421.3 million and made a $5.0 million earn out payment related to our April 2003 acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Black Beauty Coal Company. In December 2004, we acquired a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and manages the Paso Diablo mine in Venezuela, for a net purchase price of $32.5 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $4.9 million in 2005 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $693.4 million in the prior year, with the decrease primarily related to the 2004 issuance of 35.3 million shares of common stock at $11.25 per share, netting proceeds of $383.1 million; issuance of $250 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due in 2016; and the payment of debt issuance costs of $12.9 million in connection with the acquisition of the three mines discussed above. During 2004, we also completed a repricing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of an amended $450.0 million Term Loan and the $900 million Revolving Credit Facility. During 2005 and 2004, we made scheduled payments on our long term debt of $20.2 and $36.3 million, respectively. Securitized interest in accounts receivable increased by $25.0 million in 2005 compared to an increase of $110.0 million in 2004. We paid dividends of $44.5 million and $32.6 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, we issued $11.5 million in notes payable as part of an asset exchange in which we acquired additional Illinois Basin coal reserves. A detailed discussion of our debt instruments is included in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our total indebtedness consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2005 2004 Term Loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility $ 442,500 $ 448,750 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 239,525 239,525 Fair value of interest rate swaps 6.875% Senior Notes (8,879 ) 5,189 5.0% Subordinated Note 66,693 73,621 Other 15,667 7,880 Total $ 1,405,506 $ 1,424,965 On May 9, 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC, which was declared effective in June 2005. The universal shelf registration statement permits us to offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate maximum of $3 billion of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Related proceeds could be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of other debt, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions and any other purposes that may be stated in any prospectus supplement. As of December 31, 2005, no securities had been issued under the universal shelf registration statement, which remains effective. As of December 31, 2005, we had letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility of $406.7 million, leaving $493.3 million available for borrowing. This provides us with available borrowing capacity under the line of credit to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs. We were in 65 Table of Contents compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes and the 5.875% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2005. In May 2003, we entered into and designated four interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $100.0 million as a fair value hedge of our 6.875% Senior Notes. Under the swaps, we pay a floating rate that resets each March 15 and September 15, based upon the six month LIBOR rate, for a period of ten years ending March 15, 2013, and receives a fixed rate of 6.875%. The average applicable floating rate of the four swaps was 7.09% as of December 31, 2005. In September 2003, we entered into two $400.0 million interest rate swaps. One $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2010, was designated as a hedge of changes in expected cash flows on the term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under this swap we pay a fixed rate of 6.764% and receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% (6.99% at December 31, 2005) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate. Another $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2013, was designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Under this swap, we pay a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.97% (6.46% at December 31, 2005) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The swaps will lower our overall borrowing costs on $400.0 million of debt principal by 0.64% over the term of the floating to fixed swap. This results in annualized interest savings of $2.6 million over the term of the fixed to floating swap. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Year Within After 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 108,189 $ 252,518 $ 538,730 $ 1,048,169 Capital lease obligations 790 763 Operating leases obligations 84,031 139,905 75,435 103,506 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 129,522 8,993 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 203,840 398,423 149,996 44,094 Other long term liabilities(2) 168,775 327,754 370,093 961,997 Total contractual cash obligations $ 695,147 $ 1,128,356 $ 1,134,254 $ 2,157,766 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We had $138.5 million of purchase obligations related to future capital expenditures at December 31, 2005. Commitments for coal reserve related capital expenditures, including Federal Coal Leases, are included in Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations in the table above. Total capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to range from $450 million to $525 million, excluding Federal Coal Lease payments. Approximately 60% of projected 2006 capital expenditures relates to replacement, improvement, or expansion of existing mines, particularly in Appalachia and the Midwest. The remainder of the expenditures relate to growth initiatives such as increasing capacity in the Powder 66 Table of Contents River Basin. We anticipate funding these capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related and reclamation liabilities included above are expected to be funded from operating cash flow, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases and coal reserves. We believe the risk of generating lower than anticipated operating cash flow in 2006 is reduced by our high level of sales commitments, improved pricing and ongoing efforts to improve our operating cost structure. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions): Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total Self Bonding $ 671.8 $ $ $ $ 2.9 $ 674.7 Surety Bonds 335.6 258.8 19.2 28.4 642.0 Letters of Credit 0.1 22.7 144.6 120.1 119.7 407.2 $ 1,007.5 $ 281.5 $ 163.8 $ 120.1 $ 151.0 $ 1,723.9 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and collateral for surety companies. We have guaranteed $9.8 million of debt of an affiliate in which we have a 49% equity investment. We have also provided guarantees to small coal mining companies in order to facilitate their efforts to obtain bonding or financing. These guarantees arose as part of exclusive sales representation agreements with the small coal mining companies and totaled $5.5 million as of December 31, 2005. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of guarantees and indemnifications. In March 2000, we established an accounts receivable securitization program. Under the program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We used proceeds from the sale of the accounts receivable to repay long term debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The securitization program is scheduled to expire in September 2009, and the maximum amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable that may be sold to the Conduit is $225.0 million. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheet. The funding cost of the securitization program was $2.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the third quarter of 2005, we renegotiated certain terms of the program, including lowering the program pricing, removing a minimum balance requirement and adding the ability to issue letters of credit under the program. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $225.0 million and $200.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A detailed description of our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. 67 Table of Contents The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 900,000 $ 900,000 Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented In March 2005, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 04 6, Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry, which states that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. Advance stripping costs include those costs necessary to remove overburden above an unmined coal seam as part of the surface mining process, and are included as the work in process component of Inventories in the consolidated balance sheets ($245.5 million and $197.2 million as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively see Note 10). This is consistent with the concepts embodied in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins, which provides that the term inventory embraces goods awaiting sale. . ., goods in the course of production (work in process), and goods to be consumed directly or indirectly in production. . . . At the June 15 16, 2005 EITF meeting, the Task Force clarified that the intended meaning of inventory produced is inventory extracted. Based on this clarification, stripping costs incurred during a period will be attributed only to the inventory costs of the coal that is extracted during that same period. Due to physical loadout constraints and potential combustion issues, coal in most of our operations is not removed from the open pit until it is ready to ship; therefore, we will have little inventory on our balance sheet after implementing this interpretation. We expect this accounting treatment will introduce volatility in our earnings as costs associated with preparing coal for sale may be expensed before the coal is sold, and likewise, sales may be made with little to no cost matched to the sale. EITF Issue No. 04 6 is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 (January 1, 2006 for us). At the June 2005 EITF meeting, the Task Force modified the transition provisions of EITF Issue No. 04 6, indicating that companies that adopt in periods beginning after June 29, 2005 may utilize a cumulative effect adjustment approach where the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded directly to retained earnings in the year of adoption. If we had implemented the cumulative effect adjustment approach at December 31, 2005, the reduction to retained earnings, net of tax, would have been $150.6 million. We adopted EITF Issue No. 04 6 on January 1, 2006. On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 1239(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Income tax benefits from stock options exercised will be included in financing activities in the statement of cash flows rather than operating activities. In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission deferred the adoption date of SFAS No. 123(R) to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2006, and used the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. Based on stock 68 Table of Contents option grants made in 2005 (and years prior) and currently anticipated for 2006, we estimate we will recognize stock option expense for the year ending December 31, 2006, of $5.6 million, net of taxes. We began utilizing restricted stock as part of our equity based compensation strategy in January 2005. Based on the restricted stock grants made in 2005 and years prior, we recognized expense related to restricted stock of $1.0 million, net of taxes, in 2005. Accounting for restricted stock awards is not affected by the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal trading, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes, and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards at December 31, 2005, and included forwards and swaps at December 31, 2004. Our policy for accounting for coal trading activities is described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both option and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the actual low, high and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $1.2 million, $3.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. During the year ended 69 Table of Contents December 31, 2004, the actual low, high and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.5 million, $6.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Percentage Year of Expiration of Portfolio 2006 76 % 2007 23 % 2008 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. In the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2006 involves hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2005, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling A$915.8 million of which A$434.8 million, A$300.0 million and A$181.0 million will expire in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Our current expectation for 2006 non capital, Australian dollar denominated cash expenditures is approximately $633 million. A change in the Australian dollar/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of US$0.01 (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of $6.3 million per year. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $860.7 million of fixed rate borrowings and $544.8 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $5.4 million on our variable rate 70 Table of Contents borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $52.1 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2005 and 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had 15 to 25 million tons, 90 to 100 million tons and 155 to 165 million tons for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, of expected production (including steam and metallurgical coal production) available for sale or repricing at market prices. We have an annual metallurgical coal production capacity of 12 to 14 million tons. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. In addition, we utilize derivative contracts to hedge our commodity price exposure. As of December 31, 2005, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel. Notional amounts outstanding under these contracts, scheduled to expire through 2007, were 44.5 million gallons of heating oil and 24.4 million gallons of crude oil. Overall, we have fixed prices for approximately 50% of our anticipated diesel fuel requirements in 2006. We expect to consume 95 to 100 million gallons of fuel per year. On a per gallon basis, based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our operating costs of approximately $1 million per year. Alternatively, a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $2.3 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. On April 15, 2004, we acquired three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the results of operations of the two mines in Queensland, Australia and the results of operations of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado from the April 15, 2004 purchase date. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 include early debt extinguishment costs of $53.5 million pursuant to our debt refinancing in the first half of 2003. In addition, results included expense relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of EITF No. 98 10. These accounting changes are further discussed in Note 7 to our financial statements. In July 2001, we changed our fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31. The change was first effective with respect to the nine months ended December 31, 2001. In anticipation of the sale of Citizens Power, which occurred in August 2000, we classified Citizens Power as a discontinued operation as of March 31, 2000. Results in 2004 include a $2.8 million loss, net of taxes, from discontinued operations related to the settlement of a Citizens Power indemnification claim. Citizens Power is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. We have derived the selected historical financial data for the years ended and as of December 31, 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002 and the nine months ended and as of December 31, 2001 from our audited financial statements. All share and per share amounts included in the following consolidated financial data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the two for one stock splits, effective February 22, 2006, and March 30, 2005. You should read the following table in conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 34 active coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions and internationally in Australia. In 2005, we sold 239.9 million tons of coal that accounted for an estimated 21.5% of all U.S. coal sales, and were more than 69% greater than the sales of our closest domestic competitor and 49% more than our closest international competitor. Based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, demand for coal in the United States was more than 1.1 billion tons in 2005. Domestic consumption of coal is expected to grow at a rate of 1.7% per year through 2030 when U.S. coal demand is forecasted to be 1.8 billion tons. The EIA expects demand for coal use at coal to liquids (CTL) plants to grow to 190 million tons by 2030. Coal fueled generation is used in most cases to meet baseload electricity requirements, and coal use generally grows at the approximate rate of electricity growth, which is expected to average 1.6% annually through 2025. Coal production from west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth as Western production increases to a 63% share of total production in 2030. In 2004, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 51%, a share that the EIA projects will grow to 57% by 2030. Our primary customers are U.S. utilities, which accounted for 87% of our sales in 2005. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2005, approximately 90% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2005, our unpriced volumes for 2006 were 15 to 25 million tons on expected production of 230 to 240 million tons and total sales of 255 to 265 million tons. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risks Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity 49 Table of Contents generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Eastern U.S. Mining, Western U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Appalachia and Midwest operations, and our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. The principal business of the Western U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. The principal business of the Eastern U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities, as well as the mining of some metallurgical coal, sold to steel and coke producers. Geologically, Eastern operations mine bituminous and Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Our Australian Mining operations consist of our North Goonyella underground mine and our Wilkie Creek, Burton and Eaglefield surface mines. Eaglefield is a surface operation adjacent to, and fulfilling contract tonnages in conjunction with, the North Goonyella underground mine. In the first quarter of 2006, we will begin production at the 0.6 million ton per year Baralaba Mine, of which we own a 62.5% interest. The Baralaba Mine will produce PCI, a substitute for metallurgical coal, and steam coal. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining low sulfur, high Btu coal sold to an international customer base. Primarily, metallurgical coal is produced from our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 5% of our total sales volume and approximately 2% of U.S. sales volume. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 6 to 8 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. Each of our mining operations is described in Item 1 of this report. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 85% of revenues in 2005, we also generate revenues from brokering and trading coal (15% of revenues), and by creating value from our vast natural resource position by selling non core land holdings and mineral interests to generate additional cash flows as well as other ventures described below. We continue to pursue the development of coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. The projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to equity partner, contract miner or coal lessor. The projects we are currently pursuing are as follows: the 1,500 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in Washington County, Illinois; the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky; and the 300 megawatt Mustang Energy Project near Grants, New Mexico. The plants, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. The first of these plants would not be operational earlier than mid 2010. In February 2005, a group of Midwest rural electric cooperatives and municipal joint action agencies entered into definitive agreements to acquire 47% of the Prairie State Energy Campus project. After an initial appeal, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency reissued the air permit on April 28, 2005. The same parties who filed the earlier permit challenge filed a new appeal on June 8, 2005. We believe the permit was appropriately issued and expect to prevail in the appeal process. Various other required permits 50 Table of Contents are in process and may also be subject to challenge. If successfully completed, the Prairie State Energy Campus project would utilize approximately six million tons of coal each year. During 2005, we engaged in several BTU conversion projects which are designed to expand the uses of coal through various technologies. We are a founding member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non profit company that is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy to facilitate the design, construction and operation of the worlds first near zero emission coal fueled power plant. FutureGen will demonstrate advanced coal based technologies to generate electricity and also produce hydrogen to power fuel cells for transportation and other energy needs. The technology also will integrate the capture of carbon emissions with carbon sequestration, helping to address the issue of climate change as energy demand continues to grow worldwide. We also entered into an agreement to acquire a 30% interest in Econo Power International Corporation (EPICtm), which owns and markets modular coal gasifiers for industrial applications. The EPIC Clean Coal Gasification Systemtm uses air blown gasifiers to convert coal into a synthetic gas that is ideal for industrial applications. In late 2005, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC to advance project development of a commercial scale coal gasification project in Illinois that would transform coal into pipeline quality synthetic natural gas. The initial project would be designed with ConocoPhillips E Gastm Technology. When completed, the plant would be one of the largest coal to natural gas plants in the United States and would require at least three million tons of Illinois Basin coal per year to fuel two gasifier trains that could produce more than 35 billion cubic feet of synthetic natural gas. Effective January 1, 2006, Gregory H. Boyce became our President and Chief Executive Officer after we completed an orderly succession planning process. Irl F. Engelhardt, our former Chief Executive Officer, remains employed as Chairman of the Board. Effective March 1, 2005, Mr. Boyce was also elected to the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board. Effective March 30, 2005, we implemented a two for one stock split on all shares of our common stock. Subsequently, on February 22, 2006, we implemented another two for one stock split on all shares of our then outstanding common stock. All share and per share amounts in this annual report on Form 10 K reflect both stock splits. During July 2005, we increased our quarterly dividend 27% to $0.0475 per share and our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. On January 23, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 26% increase in our dividend, to $0.06 per share, to shareholders of record on February 7, 2006. In July 2005, the Board of Directors elected John F. Turner as an independent director who serves on the Boards Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Turner is former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) within the State Department and is the past President and Chief Executive Officer of the Conservation Fund, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to public private partnerships to protect land and water resources. He has also served as the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with responsibility for increasing wetland protection and establishing 55 National Wildlife Refuges, the most of any administration in the nations history. Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations in 2005 and 2004 below includes references to, and analysis of, our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable 51 Table of Contents measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 27 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Summary Our 2005 revenues of $4.64 billion increased 27.9% over the prior year. Revenues were driven higher by improved pricing in all of our mining operations and another year of industry record sales volume with 239.9 million tons sold compared to 227.2 million tons in 2004. For the year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion was a 39.5% increase over the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in the current year due to increases in sales volumes and prices at our U.S. and Australian Mining Operations. Results in our Western U.S. Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado. Results in our Australian Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Burton and North Goonyella Mines as well as the opening of the Eaglefield Mine adjacent to the North Goonyella Mine in the fourth quarter of 2004. Our Corporate and Other segment includes results from our December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. In addition, higher gains on property transactions contributed to higher year over year results. Net income was $422.7 million in 2005, or $1.58 per share, an increase of 141.0% over 2004 net income of $175.4 million, or $0.69 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended Increase December 31, (Decrease) 2005 2004 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 154.3 142.2 12.1 8.5 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 52.5 51.7 0.8 1.5 % Australian Mining Operations 8.3 6.1 2.2 36.1 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 24.8 27.2 (2.4 ) (8.8 )% Total 239.9 227.2 12.7 5.6 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Increase Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 4,545,323 $ 3,545,027 $ 1,000,296 28.2 % Other revenues 99,130 86,555 12,575 14.5 % Total revenues $ 4,644,453 $ 3,631,582 $ 1,012,871 27.9 % Our revenues increased by $1.01 billion, or 27.9%, to $4.64 billion compared to prior year. The three mines we acquired in the second quarter of 2004 contributed $365.2 million of revenue growth due to the additional 105 days of operations in 2005 compared to the prior year. The remaining $647.7 million 52 Table of Contents of revenue growth was driven by higher sales prices and volumes across all mining segments and improved volumes in our brokerage operations. Sales increased 28.2% to $4.55 billion in 2005, reflecting increases in every operating segment. Western U.S. Mining sales increased $222.2 million, Eastern U.S. Mining sales were $224.0 million higher, sales in Australia Mining improved $328.0 million and sales from our brokerage operations increased $226.0 million. Sales in every segment increased on improved pricing, and volumes were higher in every segment other than Trading and Brokerage. Our average sales price per ton increased 17.4% during 2005 due to increased demand for all of our coal products, which drove pricing higher, particularly in the regions where we produce metallurgical coal. Prices for metallurgical coal and our ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal have been the subject of increasing demand. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. We sell ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal from our Western U.S. Mining operations. The sales mix also improved due to an increase in sales from our Australian Mining segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets due primarily to a higher proportion of metallurgical coal production in the Australian segment sales mix. The increase in Eastern U.S. Mining operations sales was primarily due to improved pricing for both steam and metallurgical coal from the region. Sales in Appalachia increased $118.6 million, or 17.1% and sales in the Midwest increased $105.4 million, or 13.6%. On average, prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased 14.1% to $33.10 per ton. Production increases in the Midwest were partially offset by lower production in Appalachia compared to the prior year. Most of the decrease in production in Appalachia occurred during the fourth quarter as our largest metallurgical coal mine worked to develop a new section and relocate its longwall. Sales increased in our Western U.S. Mining operations due to higher demand driven volumes and prices. Overall, prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased 6.6% to $10.45 per ton. In the West, sales increased the most in the Powder River Basin, which improved $149.8 million due to increased sales prices and volumes. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of increasingly strong demand for the mines low sulfur product, which continues to expand its market area geographically. Powder River Basin operations were able to ship record volumes during 2005 by overcoming train derailments and weather and track maintenance disruptions on the main shipping line out of the basin. Our Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, helped our Colorado operations contribute an additional $67.3 million to sales compared to prior year due to an additional four months of ownership, higher prices and increased mine productivity. Sales from our Southwestern operations, where the Black Mesa Mine closed at the end of 2005, were comparable to prior year. Sales from our Australian Mining operations were $328.0 million, or 122.1%, higher than in 2004. The increase in Australian sales was due primarily to a 63.3% increase in per ton sales prices largely due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, an increase in volumes which included the opening of our Eaglefield surface mine at the end of 2004, and $197.6 million of incremental sales from the two mines we acquired in April 2004 due to 105 additional days of operations in 2005 compared to 2004. Our Trading and Brokerage operations sales increased $226.0 million in 2005 compared to prior year due to an increase in average per ton prices and higher eastern U.S. and international brokerage volumes. Other revenues increased $12.6 million, or 14.5%, compared to prior year primarily due to proceeds from a purchase contract restructuring and higher synthetic fuel revenues in the Midwest. 53 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion for 2005 was $305.5 million higher than 2004 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million, and was composed of the following: Increase to Segment Year Ended Year Ended Adjusted EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 459,039 $ 402,052 $ 56,987 14.2 % Eastern U.S. Mining 374,628 280,357 94,271 33.6 % Australian Mining 202,582 50,372 152,210 302.2 % Trading and Brokerage 43,058 41,039 2,019 4.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $57.0 million during 2005 due to a margin per ton increase of $0.15, or 5.3%, and a sales volume increase of 12.1 million tons. The Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, contributed $25.4 million more to Adjusted EBITDA in 2005 than in 2004, due to four months of incremental ownership and a 22.2% increase in per ton margin. The remaining increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by our Powder River Basin operations, which improved by $53.5 million and earned 12.3% higher per ton margins while increasing volumes 8.5% in response to greater demand for our low sulfur products. Improved revenues overcame increased unit costs that resulted from higher fuel costs, lower than anticipated volume due to rail difficulties and an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes. Improvements in the Powder River Basin and Colorado overcame a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $13.5 million for our Southwest operations primarily due to lower volume and higher fuel costs. Pricing improvements in the Powder River Basin generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $94.3 million, or 33.6%, compared to prior year primarily due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.71, or 31.5%. Our Appalachia operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $44.2 million, or 29.8%, as a result of sales price increases, partially offset by lower production at two of our mines and higher costs related to geologic issues, contract mining and roof support. Results in our Midwest operations were improved $50.1 million, or 37.9%, compared to prior year as benefits of higher volumes and prices were partially offset by higher costs due to higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs and the impact of heavy rainfall on surface operations early in the year. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $152.2 million in the current year, a 302.2% increase compared to prior year due to an increase of $16.23, or 197.4%, in margin per ton and 2.2 million additional tons shipped. Our Australian operations produce mostly (75% to 85%) high margin metallurgical coal. The two mines we acquired in April 2004 added $87.4 million to Adjusted EBITDA compared to eight months of ownership in 2004. The remaining increase of $64.8 million was primarily due to an increase in volume, including tonnage from our surface operation opened at the end of the prior year, and an increase of 63.3% in average per ton sale price. While current year margins benefited from strong sales prices, margin growth was limited by the impact of port congestion, related demurrage costs and higher costs due to geological problems at the underground mine. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.0 million from the prior year primarily due to higher brokerage results. Results in 2005 included a net charge of $4.0 million, primarily related to the breach of a coal supply contract by a producer (see Note 3). 54 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (208,909 ) (214,576 ) 5,667 2.6 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (316,114 ) (270,159 ) (45,955 ) (17.0 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (35,901 ) (42,387 ) 6,486 15.3 % Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) 1,751 n/a Interest expense (102,939 ) (96,793 ) (6,146 ) (6.3 )% Interest income 10,641 4,917 5,724 116.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interest of $426.1 million for the current year is $273.0 million, or 178.4%, higher than prior year primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Increases in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense offset improvements in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, asset retirement obligation expense, debt extinguishment costs and interest income. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our Venezuelan joint venture, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. The $5.7 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2005 compared to 2004 included: net gains on asset sales that were $77.7 million higher than prior year primarily due to a $37.4 million gain from a property exchange related to settlement of a contract dispute with a third party coal supplier (see Note 3), sales of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P. (PVR) units ($31.1 million) (see Note 11), resource sales involving non strategic coal assets and properties ($12.5 million), and an asset exchange in which we acquired Illinois Basin coal reserves ($6.2 million). The gain from PVR unit sales in 2005 was from the sale of all of our remaining 0.838 million units compared to a gain of $15.8 million on the sale of 0.775 million units in two separate transactions during 2004. All other gains on asset disposals in 2005 and 2004 were $14.3 million and $8.0 million, respectively; higher equity income of $18.7 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guassare (acquired in December 2004), which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela, and; lower net expenses related to generation development of $5.1 million, primarily due to reimbursements from the Prairie State Energy Campus partnership group. These improvements were partially offset by: a $36.0 million increase in past mining obligations expense, primarily related to higher retiree health care costs. The increase in retiree health care costs was actuarially driven by higher trend rates, and lower interest discount assumptions and higher amortization of actuarial losses in 2005, and; an increase of $46.8 million in selling and administrative expenses primarily related to accruals for higher short term and long term performance based incentive plans ($32.2 million). These incentives are principally long term plans that are driven by total shareholder returns. Our share price increased 104% during 2005, significantly outperforming industrial benchmarks and our coal 55 Table of Contents peer group average. The remaining increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to higher personnel and outside services costs needed to advance our growth initiatives in areas such as China and BTU conversion, acquisitions and regulatory costs (e.g. Sarbanes Oxley), and an increase in advertising costs related to an industry awareness campaign launched in late 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $46.0 million during 2005. Approximately 56% of the increase was due to acquisitions completed during 2004 and the remainder was from increased volumes at existing mines and operations opened during 2005. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased $6.5 million in 2005 due to additional expenses incurred in 2004 to accelerate the planned reclamation of certain closed mine sites. Interest expense increased $6.1 million primarily related to a full year of interest in 2005 on $250 million of 5.875% Senior Notes issued in late March of 2004 and increases in the cost of floating rate debt due to higher interest rates. Interest income improved $5.7 million due to higher yields on short term interest rates and an increase in invested balances due to improved cash flows during 2005. Net Income Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended Year Ended Income December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4 % Income tax benefit (provision) (960 ) 26,437 (27,397 ) (103.6 )% Minority interests (2,472 ) (1,282 ) (1,190 ) (92.8 )% Income from continuing operations 422,653 178,226 244,427 137.1 % Loss from discontinued operations (2,839 ) 2,839 n/a Net income $ 422,653 $ 175,387 $ 247,266 141.0 % Net income increased $247.3 million, or 141.0%, compared to the prior year due to the increase in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, partially offset by increases in our income tax provision. The income tax benefit in 2004 included a $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) and alternative minimum tax credits. The income tax provision in 2005 was higher based on the increase in pretax income which was partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion and the partial benefit of tax loss from a deemed liquidation of a subsidiary arising as an indirect consequence of a comprehensive and strategic internal restructuring we completed during 2005. This restructuring resulted from efforts to better align corporate ownership of subsidiaries on a geographic and functional basis. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Summary In 2004, our revenues increased to $3.63 billion, 29.0% higher than 2003, led by improved pricing and an industry record sales volume of 227.2 million tons. Mines acquired in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of sales and 11.0 million tons to our 2004 results. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for 2004 totaled $773.8 million, a 28.1% increase over $603.9 million in the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in 2004 due to increased sales volumes and prices. Net income in 2004 was $175.4 million, or $0.69 per share, an increase of 459.5% over 2003 net income of $31.3 million, or $0.14 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved operating results and acquisitions in 2004, and the impact in 2003 of $53.5 million in pretax early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes. 56 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2004 2003 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 142.2 129.6 12.6 9.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 51.7 46.3 5.4 11.7 % Australian Mining Operations 6.1 1.3 4.8 369.2 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 27.2 26.0 1.2 4.6 % Total 227.2 203.2 24.0 11.8 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Increase to Year Ended Year Ended Revenues December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 3,545,027 $ 2,729,323 $ 815,704 29.9 % Other revenues 86,555 85,973 582 0.7 % Total revenues $ 3,631,582 $ 2,815,296 $ 816,286 29.0 % Revenues increased by 29.0%, or $816.3 million, over 2003. The acquisition of three mines in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of total revenue and 11.0 million tons during the year. Excluding revenues from acquisitions during 2004, U.S. Mining revenues increased $375.4 million, and revenues from our brokerage operations increased $110.9 million on higher pricing and volume worldwide. Our average sales price per ton increased 14.6% during 2004 due to increased overall demand, which has driven pricing higher, most notably in Appalachia, and a change in sales mix. The sales mix has benefited from the increase in sales from the Australian segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets. In addition to geographic mix changes, our 2004 revenues included a greater proportion of higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Pricing of metallurgical coal responded to increased international demand for the product. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. Other revenues were relatively unchanged from 2003. In our Eastern U.S. Mining operations, revenues increased $302.8 million, or 25.3%, as a result of higher pricing and volumes from strong steam and metallurgical coal demand. Production increases at most eastern mines more than offset lower than expected production at certain of our mines and from contract sources as a result of geologic difficulties and from congestion related shipping delays and hurricane related production disruptions and delays to rail and export shipments. Appalachian revenues led the Eastern U.S. increase, benefiting the most from price increases while also increasing production and sales volumes. Revenues in Appalachia increased $188.1 million, or 37.0%, while in the Midwest, revenues increased by $114.7 million, or 16.6%. Revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $171.6 million, or 14.0%, on both increased volumes and prices. However, the primary driver of increased revenues in the West was a 12.6 million ton increase in sales volume. Growth in volumes were primarily in the Powder River Basin operations, where revenues were up $58.6 million, or 7.5%, and from the addition of the Twentymile Mine in April 2004, which added $99.0 million to sales. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of stronger demand for the mines low sulfur product, which overcame difficulties with rail service, downtime at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine to upgrade the loading facility and poor weather, which impaired production early in the year. Revenues in our Australian 57 Table of Contents Mining operations increased $241.5 million compared to 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of two operating mines during 2004 and benefiting from higher overall pricing for our products there. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million for 2004 was $169.9 million higher than 2003 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $603.9 million, and was composed of the following: Increase (Decrease) to Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 402,052 $ 356,898 $ 45,154 12.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining 280,357 198,964 81,393 40.9 % Australian Mining 50,372 2,225 48,147 2163.9 % Trading and Brokerage 41,039 45,828 (4,789 ) (10.4 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,820 $ 603,915 $ 169,905 28.1 % Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.2 million during 2004, margin per ton increased $0.07, or 2.5%, while sales volume increased 12.6 million tons. The April 2004 acquisition of the Twentymile Mine contributed to $31.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA increase and sales volume, adding 6.2 million tons of the volume increase in 2004. An increase of $20.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA in the Powder River Basin, due primarily to increases in sales volume, contributed most of the remaining improvement in the West. Our Powder River Basin operations continued to benefit from strong demand, leading to record shipping levels which overcame the effects of a planned outage earlier in the year to increase throughput at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine, rail service problems throughout the year and the shutdown of our Big Sky Mine at the end of 2003. Results in the Southwest approximated 2003 levels. Pricing improvements generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased $81.4 million, or 40.9%, compared to 2003 due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.11, or 25.8%, and an increase in volume by 5.4 million, or 11.7%. Improved pricing led to increased margins in our Eastern operations, despite higher processing costs incurred to upgrade from steam to metallurgical quality, the cost of substitute coal purchases to enable production to be sold in higher value metallurgical coal markets, hurricane related transportation and production interruption and increased fuel and steel costs. Appalachia operations drove the improvement in the East with a $101.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Appalachia region benefited from strong demand driven pricing and volume and increased higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Our operations in Appalachia also benefited during the current year from $21.0 million in insurance recoveries, more than offsetting higher costs due to equipment and geologic difficulties at a mine in Kentucky and a $9.6 million increase in earnings from our equity interest in a joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA in the Midwest was $20.1 million less than 2003 as increased production and sales, as well as higher overall sales prices, did not overcome poor geologic conditions at certain mines, higher equipment repair costs and higher fuel and steel costs. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $48.1 million in 2004. Our acquisition of two mines in April 2004 added 4.8 million tons and increased overall sales volume to 6.1 million tons. Most of the increase in sales tonnage was in higher margin metallurgical coal sales, driving a margin per ton increase of $6.55, or nearly 400%. The acquisitions in 2004 contributed $43.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA to results for the year. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.8 million from 2003 primarily due to higher brokerage results in 2003. Adjusted EBITDA from trading activities increased over 2003 due to improved pricing on our long position, and pure brokerage results improved on higher pricing and volumes, particularly in international brokerage. 58 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,820 $ 603,915 $ 169,905 28.1 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (214,576 ) (193,637 ) (20,939 ) (10.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (270,159 ) (234,336 ) (35,823 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (42,387 ) (31,156 ) (11,231 ) (36.0 )% Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) (53,513 ) 51,762 96.7 % Interest expense (96,793 ) (98,540 ) 1,747 1.8 % Interest income 4,917 4,086 831 20.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ 153,071 $ (3,181 ) $ 156,252 n/a Total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million for 2004 is compared with $603.9 million from 2003 in the discussion above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, resource management and our Venezuelan mining operations. The increase in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to: net gains on asset sales were $8.8 million higher in 2003, which included gains of $18.8 million on the sale of land, coal reserves and oil and gas rights, $6.4 million of other asset disposals, and $7.6 million from the sale of 1.15 million units of PVR, while 2004 included gains of only $8.0 million from other asset disposals and a $15.8 million gain from the sale of a total of 0.775 million units of PVR in two separate transactions; increased costs in 2004 for generation development ($5.3 million) related to the further development of the Prairie State and Thoroughbred Energy campuses; higher selling and administrative expenses of $34.5 million, primarily associated with higher long term incentive costs ($17.8 million), pensions, an increase in outside services costs (including costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the impact of acquisitions during 2004; and a $2.9 million increase in our accrual for future environmental obligations. These increased costs compared to 2003 were partially offset by the gain on sale of PVR units discussed above and: lower costs ($29.0 million) in 2004 associated with past mining obligations, primarily lower retiree health care costs from the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and lower closed and suspended mine spending; contributions ($1.2 million) to Adjusted EBITDA from the December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $35.8 million during 2004 due to higher volume and acquisitions. Asset retirement obligation expense increased $11.2 million during 2004 due to increased or accelerated reclamation work at certain closed mine sites and the acquisition of additional mining operations. 59 Table of Contents Debt extinguishment costs were $51.8 million higher in 2003 due to the significant prepayment premiums associated with the March 2003 refinancing, discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.

The tax benefit recorded in 2004 differs from the benefit in 2003 primarily as a result of significantly higher pre tax income, partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion. The 2004 tax benefit also included a net $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on those NOLs and alternative minimum tax credits. We evaluated and assessed the expected near term utilization of NOLs, book and taxable income trends, available tax strategies and the overall deferred tax position to determine the amount and timing of valuation allowance adjustments; a $2.8 million loss, net of tax, from discontinued operations in 2004 due to costs to resolve a contract indemnification claim related to our former Citizens Power subsidiary; lower minority interests during 2004 due to the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the recession of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook Events Impacting Near Term Operations Despite setting new industry records, shipments from our Powder River mines were lower than expected during 2005 due to a remedial maintenance program undertaken by the two railroad companies serving the Powder River Basin. The maintenance and repairs are expected to continue into 2006. We 60 Table of Contents expect these repairs may restrict shipments from our Powder River operations during 2006, but continue to anticipate higher shipment levels than 2005. Metallurgical coal production from our Appalachia operations is expected to be lower than prior year periods through the first quarter of 2006 as a metallurgical coal mine in our Appalachia segment continues development work and moves to new reserves. The longwall at the existing mine has depleted the final panel of available reserves in its current location and is relocating to a reserve extension in the first half of 2006. Following the longwall move, production of domestic metallurgical coal is expected to improve and finish the year with production equal to, or greater than, that of 2005. Our North Goonyella Mine in Australia has experienced difficult geologic conditions in 2005 and experienced a roof fall that interrupted production for portions of the third and fourth quarters. In the first quarter of 2006, we plan to install new longwall equipment to maximize operating performance under these adverse geologic conditions. We plan to meet our shipping commitments from this mine by supplementing its output with production from our newly opened, adjacent surface operation. In May 2005, we were notified of a reduced port allocation that is aimed at improving the loading of vessels and reducing demurrage at the main port for our Australian coal operations. Although port congestion has been reduced, high demurrage costs and unpredictable timing of vessel loading could continue to impact future results. Outlook Overview Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as growth continues in the U.S., Asia and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the third quarter of 2005 as reported by the U.S. Commerce Department, and Chinas economy grew 9.4% as published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Strong demand for coal and coal based electricity generation in the U.S. is being driven by the growing economy, low customer stockpiles, favorable weather, capacity constraints of nuclear generation and high prices of natural gas and oil. The high price of natural gas is leading some coal fueled generating plants to operate at increased levels. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that the high price of oil will lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including coal to liquids (CTL), and that coal will begin to displace natural gas fired generation of electricity, including the addition of CTL plants. At year end, U.S. electricity generator coal inventories were at the lowest level in the past five years. Demand for Powder River Basin coal is increasing, particularly for our ultra low sulfur products. The Powder River Basin represents more than half of our production, and the published reference price for high Btu, ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal has increased substantially, tripling during 2005. We control approximately 3.5 billion tons of proven and probable reserves in the Southern Powder River Basin and sold 125.7 million tons of coal from this region during the year ended December 31, 2005. Customers have indicated that demand for Powder River Basin coal could increase by 15% or more during 2006, although the railroads expect that they will be able to accommodate only about half of the expected increase in demand. Metallurgical coal continues to sell at a significant premium to steam coal and metallurgical markets remain strong as global steel production grew 6% to 7% in 2005. We expect to capitalize on the strong global market for metallurgical coal primarily through production and sales of metallurgical coal from our Appalachia operations and our Australian operations. We are targeting 2006 production of 230 million to 240 million tons and total sales volume of 255 million to 265 million tons, including 12 to 14 million tons of metallurgical coal. As of December 31, 2005, our unpriced volumes for produced tonnage for 2006 were 15 to 25 million tons. Management expects strong market conditions and operating performance to overcome external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs. In addition, historically low long term interest 61 Table of Contents rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities Our subsidiaries have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs, workers compensation obligations and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 16, 17 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, for these liabilities totaled $193.8 million, while payments were $147.1 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate (dollars in thousands): One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 8,789 $ (6,961 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 161,903 $ (135,501 ) 62 Table of Contents Discount rate (dollars in thousands): One Half One Half Percentage Point Percentage Point Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 1,183 $ (1,563 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (68,900 ) $ 75,878 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.99 years at December 31, 2005. Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $35.9 million, and payments totaled $33.6 million. See detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest, as considered appropriate by management. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Additional details regarding the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in Note 13. 63 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 98% of our revenue in 2005 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these agreements, risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessels, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal in over the counter markets. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal and emission allowance positions. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Ninety nine percent of the contracts in our trading portfolio as of December 31, 2005 were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials, and one percent of our contracts were valued based on similar market transactions. As of December 31, 2005, 76% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2006. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statement for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable through our securitization program. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as planned acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends, among other things, are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. We typically fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations, and during 2005 and 2004 we had no borrowings outstanding under our $900.0 million revolving line of credit, which we use primarily for standby letters of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities was $702.8 million in 2005, an increase of $419.0 million, or 147.6%, from 2004. The increase was primarily driven by stronger operational performance in 2005, as net income increased $247.3 million from the prior year. Also contributing to the increase was lower funding of pension plans in 2005, as we voluntarily pre funded $50.0 million in the prior year. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher working capital cash flows of $85.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $584.2 million during 2005 compared to $705.0 million used in 2004. Total capital expenditures were $643.9 million in 2005, an increase of $377.3 million over prior year. In 2005, we purchased mining and related assets of $141.2 million, which included $56.5 million for 64 Table of Contents the acquisition of coal reserves in Illinois and Indiana along with surface property and equipment and $84.7 million for the acquisition of mining and transportation infrastructure in the Powder River Basin. Our $118.4 million in federal coal lease expenditures in 2005 were similar to the 2004 expenditures. Other capital expenditures of $384.3 million were $232.4 million higher than the prior year. The 2005 other capital expenditures included the longwall equipment and mine development at our Australian mines, longwall replacement at our Twentymile mine, the opening of new mines and upgrading of existing mines in the Midwest and Appalachia, and expansion equipment. In 2005, we were able to make several acquisitions of strategic coal reserves and mining assets due to the strong operating results that we experienced in 2005. Proceeds from the disposal of assets increased $36.9 million primarily due to higher proceeds in 2005 from the sale of PVR units and non strategic property, reserves and equipment. In 2004, we acquired the Twentymile mine in Colorado and two mines in Australia for $421.3 million and made a $5.0 million earn out payment related to our April 2003 acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Black Beauty Coal Company. In December 2004, we acquired a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and manages the Paso Diablo mine in Venezuela, for a net purchase price of $32.5 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $4.9 million in 2005 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $693.4 million in the prior year, with the decrease primarily related to the 2004 issuance of 35.3 million shares of common stock at $11.25 per share, netting proceeds of $383.1 million; issuance of $250 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due in 2016; and the payment of debt issuance costs of $12.9 million in connection with the acquisition of the three mines discussed above. During 2004, we also completed a repricing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of an amended $450.0 million Term Loan and the $900 million Revolving Credit Facility. During 2005 and 2004, we made scheduled payments on our long term debt of $20.2 and $36.3 million, respectively. Securitized interest in accounts receivable increased by $25.0 million in 2005 compared to an increase of $110.0 million in 2004. We paid dividends of $44.5 million and $32.6 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, we issued $11.5 million in notes payable as part of an asset exchange in which we acquired additional Illinois Basin coal reserves. A detailed discussion of our debt instruments is included in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our total indebtedness consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2005 2004 Term Loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility $ 442,500 $ 448,750 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 239,525 239,525 Fair value of interest rate swaps 6.875% Senior Notes (8,879 ) 5,189 5.0% Subordinated Note 66,693 73,621 Other 15,667 7,880 Total $ 1,405,506 $ 1,424,965 On May 9, 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC, which was declared effective in June 2005. The universal shelf registration statement permits us to offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate maximum of $3 billion of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Related proceeds could be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of other debt, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions and any other purposes that may be stated in any prospectus supplement. As of December 31, 2005, no securities had been issued under the universal shelf registration statement, which remains effective. As of December 31, 2005, we had letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility of $406.7 million, leaving $493.3 million available for borrowing. This provides us with available borrowing capacity under the line of credit to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs. We were in 65 Table of Contents compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes and the 5.875% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2005. In May 2003, we entered into and designated four interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $100.0 million as a fair value hedge of our 6.875% Senior Notes. Under the swaps, we pay a floating rate that resets each March 15 and September 15, based upon the six month LIBOR rate, for a period of ten years ending March 15, 2013, and receives a fixed rate of 6.875%. The average applicable floating rate of the four swaps was 7.09% as of December 31, 2005. In September 2003, we entered into two $400.0 million interest rate swaps. One $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2010, was designated as a hedge of changes in expected cash flows on the term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under this swap we pay a fixed rate of 6.764% and receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% (6.99% at December 31, 2005) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate. Another $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2013, was designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Under this swap, we pay a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.97% (6.46% at December 31, 2005) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The swaps will lower our overall borrowing costs on $400.0 million of debt principal by 0.64% over the term of the floating to fixed swap. This results in annualized interest savings of $2.6 million over the term of the fixed to floating swap. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Year Within After 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 108,189 $ 252,518 $ 538,730 $ 1,048,169 Capital lease obligations 790 763 Operating leases obligations 84,031 139,905 75,435 103,506 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 129,522 8,993 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 203,840 398,423 149,996 44,094 Other long term liabilities(2) 168,775 327,754 370,093 961,997 Total contractual cash obligations $ 695,147 $ 1,128,356 $ 1,134,254 $ 2,157,766 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We had $138.5 million of purchase obligations related to future capital expenditures at December 31, 2005. Commitments for coal reserve related capital expenditures, including Federal Coal Leases, are included in Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations in the table above. Total capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to range from $450 million to $525 million, excluding Federal Coal Lease payments. Approximately 60% of projected 2006 capital expenditures relates to replacement, improvement, or expansion of existing mines, particularly in Appalachia and the Midwest. The remainder of the expenditures relate to growth initiatives such as increasing capacity in the Powder 66 Table of Contents River Basin. We anticipate funding these capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related and reclamation liabilities included above are expected to be funded from operating cash flow, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases and coal reserves. We believe the risk of generating lower than anticipated operating cash flow in 2006 is reduced by our high level of sales commitments, improved pricing and ongoing efforts to improve our operating cost structure. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions): Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total Self Bonding $ 671.8 $ $ $ $ 2.9 $ 674.7 Surety Bonds 335.6 258.8 19.2 28.4 642.0 Letters of Credit 0.1 22.7 144.6 120.1 119.7 407.2 $ 1,007.5 $ 281.5 $ 163.8 $ 120.1 $ 151.0 $ 1,723.9 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and collateral for surety companies. We have guaranteed $9.8 million of debt of an affiliate in which we have a 49% equity investment. We have also provided guarantees to small coal mining companies in order to facilitate their efforts to obtain bonding or financing. These guarantees arose as part of exclusive sales representation agreements with the small coal mining companies and totaled $5.5 million as of December 31, 2005. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of guarantees and indemnifications. In March 2000, we established an accounts receivable securitization program. Under the program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We used proceeds from the sale of the accounts receivable to repay long term debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The securitization program is scheduled to expire in September 2009, and the maximum amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable that may be sold to the Conduit is $225.0 million. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheet. The funding cost of the securitization program was $2.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the third quarter of 2005, we renegotiated certain terms of the program, including lowering the program pricing, removing a minimum balance requirement and adding the ability to issue letters of credit under the program. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $225.0 million and $200.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A detailed description of our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. 67 Table of Contents The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 900,000 $ 900,000 Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented In March 2005, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 04 6, Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry, which states that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. Advance stripping costs include those costs necessary to remove overburden above an unmined coal seam as part of the surface mining process, and are included as the work in process component of Inventories in the consolidated balance sheets ($245.5 million and $197.2 million as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively see Note 10). This is consistent with the concepts embodied in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins, which provides that the term inventory embraces goods awaiting sale. . ., goods in the course of production (work in process), and goods to be consumed directly or indirectly in production. . . . At the June 15 16, 2005 EITF meeting, the Task Force clarified that the intended meaning of inventory produced is inventory extracted. Based on this clarification, stripping costs incurred during a period will be attributed only to the inventory costs of the coal that is extracted during that same period. Due to physical loadout constraints and potential combustion issues, coal in most of our operations is not removed from the open pit until it is ready to ship; therefore, we will have little inventory on our balance sheet after implementing this interpretation. We expect this accounting treatment will introduce volatility in our earnings as costs associated with preparing coal for sale may be expensed before the coal is sold, and likewise, sales may be made with little to no cost matched to the sale. EITF Issue No. 04 6 is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 (January 1, 2006 for us). At the June 2005 EITF meeting, the Task Force modified the transition provisions of EITF Issue No. 04 6, indicating that companies that adopt in periods beginning after June 29, 2005 may utilize a cumulative effect adjustment approach where the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded directly to retained earnings in the year of adoption. If we had implemented the cumulative effect adjustment approach at December 31, 2005, the reduction to retained earnings, net of tax, would have been $150.6 million. We adopted EITF Issue No. 04 6 on January 1, 2006. On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 1239(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Income tax benefits from stock options exercised will be included in financing activities in the statement of cash flows rather than operating activities. In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission deferred the adoption date of SFAS No. 123(R) to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2006, and used the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. Based on stock 68 Table of Contents option grants made in 2005 (and years prior) and currently anticipated for 2006, we estimate we will recognize stock option expense for the year ending December 31, 2006, of $5.6 million, net of taxes. We began utilizing restricted stock as part of our equity based compensation strategy in January 2005. Based on the restricted stock grants made in 2005 and years prior, we recognized expense related to restricted stock of $1.0 million, net of taxes, in 2005. Accounting for restricted stock awards is not affected by the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal trading, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes, and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards at December 31, 2005, and included forwards and swaps at December 31, 2004. Our policy for accounting for coal trading activities is described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both option and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the actual low, high and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $1.2 million, $3.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. During the year ended 69 Table of Contents December 31, 2004, the actual low, high and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.5 million, $6.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Percentage Year of Expiration of Portfolio 2006 76 % 2007 23 % 2008 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. In the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2006 involves hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2005, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling A$915.8 million of which A$434.8 million, A$300.0 million and A$181.0 million will expire in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Our current expectation for 2006 non capital, Australian dollar denominated cash expenditures is approximately $633 million. A change in the Australian dollar/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of US$0.01 (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of $6.3 million per year. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $860.7 million of fixed rate borrowings and $544.8 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $5.4 million on our variable rate 70 Table of Contents borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $52.1 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2005 and 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had 15 to 25 million tons, 90 to 100 million tons and 155 to 165 million tons for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, of expected production (including steam and metallurgical coal production) available for sale or repricing at market prices. We have an annual metallurgical coal production capacity of 12 to 14 million tons. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. In addition, we utilize derivative contracts to hedge our commodity price exposure. As of December 31, 2005, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel. Notional amounts outstanding under these contracts, scheduled to expire through 2007, were 44.5 million gallons of heating oil and 24.4 million gallons of crude oil. Overall, we have fixed prices for approximately 50% of our anticipated diesel fuel requirements in 2006. We expect to consume 95 to 100 million gallons of fuel per year. On a per gallon basis, based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our operating costs of approximately $1 million per year. Alternatively, a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $2.3 million. 
 
Item 7.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 34 active coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions and internationally in Australia. In 2005, we sold 239.9 million tons of coal that accounted for an estimated 21.5% of all U.S. coal sales, and were more than 69% greater than the sales of our closest domestic competitor and 49% more than our closest international competitor. Based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, demand for coal in the United States was more than 1.1 billion tons in 2005. Domestic consumption of coal is expected to grow at a rate of 1.7% per year through 2030 when U.S. coal demand is forecasted to be 1.8 billion tons. The EIA expects demand for coal use at coal to liquids (CTL) plants to grow to 190 million tons by 2030. Coal fueled generation is used in most cases to meet baseload electricity requirements, and coal use generally grows at the approximate rate of electricity growth, which is expected to average 1.6% annually through 2025. Coal production from west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth as Western production increases to a 63% share of total production in 2030. In 2004, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 51%, a share that the EIA projects will grow to 57% by 2030. Our primary customers are U.S. utilities, which accounted for 87% of our sales in 2005. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2005, approximately 90% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2005, our unpriced volumes for 2006 were 15 to 25 million tons on expected production of 230 to 240 million tons and total sales of 255 to 265 million tons. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risks Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity 49 Table of Contents generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Eastern U.S. Mining, Western U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Appalachia and Midwest operations, and our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. The principal business of the Western U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. The principal business of the Eastern U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities, as well as the mining of some metallurgical coal, sold to steel and coke producers. Geologically, Eastern operations mine bituminous and Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Our Australian Mining operations consist of our North Goonyella underground mine and our Wilkie Creek, Burton and Eaglefield surface mines. Eaglefield is a surface operation adjacent to, and fulfilling contract tonnages in conjunction with, the North Goonyella underground mine. In the first quarter of 2006, we will begin production at the 0.6 million ton per year Baralaba Mine, of which we own a 62.5% interest. The Baralaba Mine will produce PCI, a substitute for metallurgical coal, and steam coal. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining low sulfur, high Btu coal sold to an international customer base. Primarily, metallurgical coal is produced from our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 5% of our total sales volume and approximately 2% of U.S. sales volume. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 6 to 8 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. Each of our mining operations is described in Item 1 of this report. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 85% of revenues in 2005, we also generate revenues from brokering and trading coal (15% of revenues), and by creating value from our vast natural resource position by selling non core land holdings and mineral interests to generate additional cash flows as well as other ventures described below. We continue to pursue the development of coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. The projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to equity partner, contract miner or coal lessor. The projects we are currently pursuing are as follows: the 1,500 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in Washington County, Illinois; the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky; and the 300 megawatt Mustang Energy Project near Grants, New Mexico. The plants, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. The first of these plants would not be operational earlier than mid 2010. In February 2005, a group of Midwest rural electric cooperatives and municipal joint action agencies entered into definitive agreements to acquire 47% of the Prairie State Energy Campus project. After an initial appeal, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency reissued the air permit on April 28, 2005. The same parties who filed the earlier permit challenge filed a new appeal on June 8, 2005. We believe the permit was appropriately issued and expect to prevail in the appeal process. Various other required permits 50 Table of Contents are in process and may also be subject to challenge. If successfully completed, the Prairie State Energy Campus project would utilize approximately six million tons of coal each year. During 2005, we engaged in several BTU conversion projects which are designed to expand the uses of coal through various technologies. We are a founding member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non profit company that is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy to facilitate the design, construction and operation of the worlds first near zero emission coal fueled power plant. FutureGen will demonstrate advanced coal based technologies to generate electricity and also produce hydrogen to power fuel cells for transportation and other energy needs. The technology also will integrate the capture of carbon emissions with carbon sequestration, helping to address the issue of climate change as energy demand continues to grow worldwide. We also entered into an agreement to acquire a 30% interest in Econo Power International Corporation (EPICtm), which owns and markets modular coal gasifiers for industrial applications. The EPIC Clean Coal Gasification Systemtm uses air blown gasifiers to convert coal into a synthetic gas that is ideal for industrial applications. In late 2005, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC to advance project development of a commercial scale coal gasification project in Illinois that would transform coal into pipeline quality synthetic natural gas. The initial project would be designed with ConocoPhillips E Gastm Technology. When completed, the plant would be one of the largest coal to natural gas plants in the United States and would require at least three million tons of Illinois Basin coal per year to fuel two gasifier trains that could produce more than 35 billion cubic feet of synthetic natural gas. Effective January 1, 2006, Gregory H. Boyce became our President and Chief Executive Officer after we completed an orderly succession planning process. Irl F. Engelhardt, our former Chief Executive Officer, remains employed as Chairman of the Board. Effective March 1, 2005, Mr. Boyce was also elected to the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board. Effective March 30, 2005, we implemented a two for one stock split on all shares of our common stock. Subsequently, on February 22, 2006, we implemented another two for one stock split on all shares of our then outstanding common stock. All share and per share amounts in this annual report on Form 10 K reflect both stock splits. During July 2005, we increased our quarterly dividend 27% to $0.0475 per share and our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. On January 23, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 26% increase in our dividend, to $0.06 per share, to shareholders of record on February 7, 2006. In July 2005, the Board of Directors elected John F. Turner as an independent director who serves on the Boards Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Turner is former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) within the State Department and is the past President and Chief Executive Officer of the Conservation Fund, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to public private partnerships to protect land and water resources. He has also served as the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with responsibility for increasing wetland protection and establishing 55 National Wildlife Refuges, the most of any administration in the nations history. Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations in 2005 and 2004 below includes references to, and analysis of, our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable 51 Table of Contents measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 27 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Summary Our 2005 revenues of $4.64 billion increased 27.9% over the prior year. Revenues were driven higher by improved pricing in all of our mining operations and another year of industry record sales volume with 239.9 million tons sold compared to 227.2 million tons in 2004. For the year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion was a 39.5% increase over the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in the current year due to increases in sales volumes and prices at our U.S. and Australian Mining Operations. Results in our Western U.S. Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado. Results in our Australian Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Burton and North Goonyella Mines as well as the opening of the Eaglefield Mine adjacent to the North Goonyella Mine in the fourth quarter of 2004. Our Corporate and Other segment includes results from our December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. In addition, higher gains on property transactions contributed to higher year over year results. Net income was $422.7 million in 2005, or $1.58 per share, an increase of 141.0% over 2004 net income of $175.4 million, or $0.69 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended Increase December 31, (Decrease) 2005 2004 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 154.3 142.2 12.1 8.5 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 52.5 51.7 0.8 1.5 % Australian Mining Operations 8.3 6.1 2.2 36.1 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 24.8 27.2 (2.4 ) (8.8 )% Total 239.9 227.2 12.7 5.6 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Increase Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 4,545,323 $ 3,545,027 $ 1,000,296 28.2 % Other revenues 99,130 86,555 12,575 14.5 % Total revenues $ 4,644,453 $ 3,631,582 $ 1,012,871 27.9 % Our revenues increased by $1.01 billion, or 27.9%, to $4.64 billion compared to prior year. The three mines we acquired in the second quarter of 2004 contributed $365.2 million of revenue growth due to the additional 105 days of operations in 2005 compared to the prior year. The remaining $647.7 million 52 Table of Contents of revenue growth was driven by higher sales prices and volumes across all mining segments and improved volumes in our brokerage operations. Sales increased 28.2% to $4.55 billion in 2005, reflecting increases in every operating segment. Western U.S. Mining sales increased $222.2 million, Eastern U.S. Mining sales were $224.0 million higher, sales in Australia Mining improved $328.0 million and sales from our brokerage operations increased $226.0 million. Sales in every segment increased on improved pricing, and volumes were higher in every segment other than Trading and Brokerage. Our average sales price per ton increased 17.4% during 2005 due to increased demand for all of our coal products, which drove pricing higher, particularly in the regions where we produce metallurgical coal. Prices for metallurgical coal and our ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal have been the subject of increasing demand. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. We sell ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal from our Western U.S. Mining operations. The sales mix also improved due to an increase in sales from our Australian Mining segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets due primarily to a higher proportion of metallurgical coal production in the Australian segment sales mix. The increase in Eastern U.S. Mining operations sales was primarily due to improved pricing for both steam and metallurgical coal from the region. Sales in Appalachia increased $118.6 million, or 17.1% and sales in the Midwest increased $105.4 million, or 13.6%. On average, prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased 14.1% to $33.10 per ton. Production increases in the Midwest were partially offset by lower production in Appalachia compared to the prior year. Most of the decrease in production in Appalachia occurred during the fourth quarter as our largest metallurgical coal mine worked to develop a new section and relocate its longwall. Sales increased in our Western U.S. Mining operations due to higher demand driven volumes and prices. Overall, prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased 6.6% to $10.45 per ton. In the West, sales increased the most in the Powder River Basin, which improved $149.8 million due to increased sales prices and volumes. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of increasingly strong demand for the mines low sulfur product, which continues to expand its market area geographically. Powder River Basin operations were able to ship record volumes during 2005 by overcoming train derailments and weather and track maintenance disruptions on the main shipping line out of the basin. Our Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, helped our Colorado operations contribute an additional $67.3 million to sales compared to prior year due to an additional four months of ownership, higher prices and increased mine productivity. Sales from our Southwestern operations, where the Black Mesa Mine closed at the end of 2005, were comparable to prior year. Sales from our Australian Mining operations were $328.0 million, or 122.1%, higher than in 2004. The increase in Australian sales was due primarily to a 63.3% increase in per ton sales prices largely due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, an increase in volumes which included the opening of our Eaglefield surface mine at the end of 2004, and $197.6 million of incremental sales from the two mines we acquired in April 2004 due to 105 additional days of operations in 2005 compared to 2004. Our Trading and Brokerage operations sales increased $226.0 million in 2005 compared to prior year due to an increase in average per ton prices and higher eastern U.S. and international brokerage volumes. Other revenues increased $12.6 million, or 14.5%, compared to prior year primarily due to proceeds from a purchase contract restructuring and higher synthetic fuel revenues in the Midwest. 53 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion for 2005 was $305.5 million higher than 2004 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million, and was composed of the following: Increase to Segment Year Ended Year Ended Adjusted EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 459,039 $ 402,052 $ 56,987 14.2 % Eastern U.S. Mining 374,628 280,357 94,271 33.6 % Australian Mining 202,582 50,372 152,210 302.2 % Trading and Brokerage 43,058 41,039 2,019 4.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $57.0 million during 2005 due to a margin per ton increase of $0.15, or 5.3%, and a sales volume increase of 12.1 million tons. The Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, contributed $25.4 million more to Adjusted EBITDA in 2005 than in 2004, due to four months of incremental ownership and a 22.2% increase in per ton margin. The remaining increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by our Powder River Basin operations, which improved by $53.5 million and earned 12.3% higher per ton margins while increasing volumes 8.5% in response to greater demand for our low sulfur products. Improved revenues overcame increased unit costs that resulted from higher fuel costs, lower than anticipated volume due to rail difficulties and an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes. Improvements in the Powder River Basin and Colorado overcame a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $13.5 million for our Southwest operations primarily due to lower volume and higher fuel costs. Pricing improvements in the Powder River Basin generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $94.3 million, or 33.6%, compared to prior year primarily due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.71, or 31.5%. Our Appalachia operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $44.2 million, or 29.8%, as a result of sales price increases, partially offset by lower production at two of our mines and higher costs related to geologic issues, contract mining and roof support. Results in our Midwest operations were improved $50.1 million, or 37.9%, compared to prior year as benefits of higher volumes and prices were partially offset by higher costs due to higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs and the impact of heavy rainfall on surface operations early in the year. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $152.2 million in the current year, a 302.2% increase compared to prior year due to an increase of $16.23, or 197.4%, in margin per ton and 2.2 million additional tons shipped. Our Australian operations produce mostly (75% to 85%) high margin metallurgical coal. The two mines we acquired in April 2004 added $87.4 million to Adjusted EBITDA compared to eight months of ownership in 2004. The remaining increase of $64.8 million was primarily due to an increase in volume, including tonnage from our surface operation opened at the end of the prior year, and an increase of 63.3% in average per ton sale price. While current year margins benefited from strong sales prices, margin growth was limited by the impact of port congestion, related demurrage costs and higher costs due to geological problems at the underground mine. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.0 million from the prior year primarily due to higher brokerage results. Results in 2005 included a net charge of $4.0 million, primarily related to the breach of a coal supply contract by a producer (see Note 3). 54 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (208,909 ) (214,576 ) 5,667 2.6 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (316,114 ) (270,159 ) (45,955 ) (17.0 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (35,901 ) (42,387 ) 6,486 15.3 % Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) 1,751 n/a Interest expense (102,939 ) (96,793 ) (6,146 ) (6.3 )% Interest income 10,641 4,917 5,724 116.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interest of $426.1 million for the current year is $273.0 million, or 178.4%, higher than prior year primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Increases in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense offset improvements in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, asset retirement obligation expense, debt extinguishment costs and interest income. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our Venezuelan joint venture, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. The $5.7 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2005 compared to 2004 included: net gains on asset sales that were $77.7 million higher than prior year primarily due to a $37.4 million gain from a property exchange related to settlement of a contract dispute with a third party coal supplier (see Note 3), sales of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P. (PVR) units ($31.1 million) (see Note 11), resource sales involving non strategic coal assets and properties ($12.5 million), and an asset exchange in which we acquired Illinois Basin coal reserves ($6.2 million). The gain from PVR unit sales in 2005 was from the sale of all of our remaining 0.838 million units compared to a gain of $15.8 million on the sale of 0.775 million units in two separate transactions during 2004. All other gains on asset disposals in 2005 and 2004 were $14.3 million and $8.0 million, respectively; higher equity income of $18.7 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guassare (acquired in December 2004), which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela, and; lower net expenses related to generation development of $5.1 million, primarily due to reimbursements from the Prairie State Energy Campus partnership group. These improvements were partially offset by: a $36.0 million increase in past mining obligations expense, primarily related to higher retiree health care costs. The increase in retiree health care costs was actuarially driven by higher trend rates, and lower interest discount assumptions and higher amortization of actuarial losses in 2005, and; an increase of $46.8 million in selling and administrative expenses primarily related to accruals for higher short term and long term performance based incentive plans ($32.2 million). These incentives are principally long term plans that are driven by total shareholder returns. Our share price increased 104% during 2005, significantly outperforming industrial benchmarks and our coal 55 Table of Contents peer group average. The remaining increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to higher personnel and outside services costs needed to advance our growth initiatives in areas such as China and BTU conversion, acquisitions and regulatory costs (e.g. Sarbanes Oxley), and an increase in advertising costs related to an industry awareness campaign launched in late 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $46.0 million during 2005. Approximately 56% of the increase was due to acquisitions completed during 2004 and the remainder was from increased volumes at existing mines and operations opened during 2005. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased $6.5 million in 2005 due to additional expenses incurred in 2004 to accelerate the planned reclamation of certain closed mine sites. Interest expense increased $6.1 million primarily related to a full year of interest in 2005 on $250 million of 5.875% Senior Notes issued in late March of 2004 and increases in the cost of floating rate debt due to higher interest rates. Interest income improved $5.7 million due to higher yields on short term interest rates and an increase in invested balances due to improved cash flows during 2005. Net Income Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended Year Ended Income December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4 % Income tax benefit (provision) (960 ) 26,437 (27,397 ) (103.6 )% Minority interests (2,472 ) (1,282 ) (1,190 ) (92.8 )% Income from continuing operations 422,653 178,226 244,427 137.1 % Loss from discontinued operations (2,839 ) 2,839 n/a Net income $ 422,653 $ 175,387 $ 247,266 141.0 % Net income increased $247.3 million, or 141.0%, compared to the prior year due to the increase in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, partially offset by increases in our income tax provision. The income tax benefit in 2004 included a $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) and alternative minimum tax credits. The income tax provision in 2005 was higher based on the increase in pretax income which was partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion and the partial benefit of tax loss from a deemed liquidation of a subsidiary arising as an indirect consequence of a comprehensive and strategic internal restructuring we completed during 2005. This restructuring resulted from efforts to better align corporate ownership of subsidiaries on a geographic and functional basis. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Summary In 2004, our revenues increased to $3.63 billion, 29.0% higher than 2003, led by improved pricing and an industry record sales volume of 227.2 million tons. Mines acquired in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of sales and 11.0 million tons to our 2004 results. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for 2004 totaled $773.8 million, a 28.1% increase over $603.9 million in the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in 2004 due to increased sales volumes and prices. Net income in 2004 was $175.4 million, or $0.69 per share, an increase of 459.5% over 2003 net income of $31.3 million, or $0.14 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved operating results and acquisitions in 2004, and the impact in 2003 of $53.5 million in pretax early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes. 56 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2004 2003 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 142.2 129.6 12.6 9.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 51.7 46.3 5.4 11.7 % Australian Mining Operations 6.1 1.3 4.8 369.2 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 27.2 26.0 1.2 4.6 % Total 227.2 203.2 24.0 11.8 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Increase to Year Ended Year Ended Revenues December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 3,545,027 $ 2,729,323 $ 815,704 29.9 % Other revenues 86,555 85,973 582 0.7 % Total revenues $ 3,631,582 $ 2,815,296 $ 816,286 29.0 % Revenues increased by 29.0%, or $816.3 million, over 2003. The acquisition of three mines in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of total revenue and 11.0 million tons during the year. Excluding revenues from acquisitions during 2004, U.S. Mining revenues increased $375.4 million, and revenues from our brokerage operations increased $110.9 million on higher pricing and volume worldwide. Our average sales price per ton increased 14.6% during 2004 due to increased overall demand, which has driven pricing higher, most notably in Appalachia, and a change in sales mix. The sales mix has benefited from the increase in sales from the Australian segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets. In addition to geographic mix changes, our 2004 revenues included a greater proportion of higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Pricing of metallurgical coal responded to increased international demand for the product. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. Other revenues were relatively unchanged from 2003. In our Eastern U.S. Mining operations, revenues increased $302.8 million, or 25.3%, as a result of higher pricing and volumes from strong steam and metallurgical coal demand. Production increases at most eastern mines more than offset lower than expected production at certain of our mines and from contract sources as a result of geologic difficulties and from congestion related shipping delays and hurricane related production disruptions and delays to rail and export shipments. Appalachian revenues led the Eastern U.S. increase, benefiting the most from price increases while also increasing production and sales volumes. Revenues in Appalachia increased $188.1 million, or 37.0%, while in the Midwest, revenues increased by $114.7 million, or 16.6%. Revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $171.6 million, or 14.0%, on both increased volumes and prices. However, the primary driver of increased revenues in the West was a 12.6 million ton increase in sales volume. Growth in volumes were primarily in the Powder River Basin operations, where revenues were up $58.6 million, or 7.5%, and from the addition of the Twentymile Mine in April 2004, which added $99.0 million to sales. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of stronger demand for the mines low sulfur product, which overcame difficulties with rail service, downtime at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine to upgrade the loading facility and poor weather, which impaired production early in the year. Revenues in our Australian 57 Table of Contents Mining operations increased $241.5 million compared to 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of two operating mines during 2004 and benefiting from higher overall pricing for our products there. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million for 2004 was $169.9 million higher than 2003 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $603.9 million, and was composed of the following: Increase (Decrease) to Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 402,052 $ 356,898 $ 45,154 12.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining 280,357 198,964 81,393 40.9 % Australian Mining 50,372 2,225 48,147 2163.9 % Trading and Brokerage 41,039 45,828 (4,789 ) (10.4 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,820 $ 603,915 $ 169,905 28.1 % Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.2 million during 2004, margin per ton increased $0.07, or 2.5%, while sales volume increased 12.6 million tons. The April 2004 acquisition of the Twentymile Mine contributed to $31.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA increase and sales volume, adding 6.2 million tons of the volume increase in 2004. An increase of $20.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA in the Powder River Basin, due primarily to increases in sales volume, contributed most of the remaining improvement in the West. Our Powder River Basin operations continued to benefit from strong demand, leading to record shipping levels which overcame the effects of a planned outage earlier in the year to increase throughput at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine, rail service problems throughout the year and the shutdown of our Big Sky Mine at the end of 2003. Results in the Southwest approximated 2003 levels. Pricing improvements generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased $81.4 million, or 40.9%, compared to 2003 due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.11, or 25.8%, and an increase in volume by 5.4 million, or 11.7%. Improved pricing led to increased margins in our Eastern operations, despite higher processing costs incurred to upgrade from steam to metallurgical quality, the cost of substitute coal purchases to enable production to be sold in higher value metallurgical coal markets, hurricane related transportation and production interruption and increased fuel and steel costs. Appalachia operations drove the improvement in the East with a $101.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Appalachia region benefited from strong demand driven pricing and volume and increased higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Our operations in Appalachia also benefited during the current year from $21.0 million in insurance recoveries, more than offsetting higher costs due to equipment and geologic difficulties at a mine in Kentucky and a $9.6 million increase in earnings from our equity interest in a joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA in the Midwest was $20.1 million less than 2003 as increased production and sales, as well as higher overall sales prices, did not overcome poor geologic conditions at certain mines, higher equipment repair costs and higher fuel and steel costs. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $48.1 million in 2004. Our acquisition of two mines in April 2004 added 4.8 million tons and increased overall sales volume to 6.1 million tons. Most of the increase in sales tonnage was in higher margin metallurgical coal sales, driving a margin per ton increase of $6.55, or nearly 400%. The acquisitions in 2004 contributed $43.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA to results for the year. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.8 million from 2003 primarily due to higher brokerage results in 2003. Adjusted EBITDA from trading activities increased over 2003 due to improved pricing on our long position, and pure brokerage results improved on higher pricing and volumes, particularly in international brokerage. 58 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,820 $ 603,915 $ 169,905 28.1 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (214,576 ) (193,637 ) (20,939 ) (10.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (270,159 ) (234,336 ) (35,823 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (42,387 ) (31,156 ) (11,231 ) (36.0 )% Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) (53,513 ) 51,762 96.7 % Interest expense (96,793 ) (98,540 ) 1,747 1.8 % Interest income 4,917 4,086 831 20.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ 153,071 $ (3,181 ) $ 156,252 n/a Total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million for 2004 is compared with $603.9 million from 2003 in the discussion above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, resource management and our Venezuelan mining operations. The increase in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to: net gains on asset sales were $8.8 million higher in 2003, which included gains of $18.8 million on the sale of land, coal reserves and oil and gas rights, $6.4 million of other asset disposals, and $7.6 million from the sale of 1.15 million units of PVR, while 2004 included gains of only $8.0 million from other asset disposals and a $15.8 million gain from the sale of a total of 0.775 million units of PVR in two separate transactions; increased costs in 2004 for generation development ($5.3 million) related to the further development of the Prairie State and Thoroughbred Energy campuses; higher selling and administrative expenses of $34.5 million, primarily associated with higher long term incentive costs ($17.8 million), pensions, an increase in outside services costs (including costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the impact of acquisitions during 2004; and a $2.9 million increase in our accrual for future environmental obligations. These increased costs compared to 2003 were partially offset by the gain on sale of PVR units discussed above and: lower costs ($29.0 million) in 2004 associated with past mining obligations, primarily lower retiree health care costs from the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and lower closed and suspended mine spending; contributions ($1.2 million) to Adjusted EBITDA from the December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $35.8 million during 2004 due to higher volume and acquisitions. Asset retirement obligation expense increased $11.2 million during 2004 due to increased or accelerated reclamation work at certain closed mine sites and the acquisition of additional mining operations. 59 Table of Contents Debt extinguishment costs were $51.8 million higher in 2003 due to the significant prepayment premiums associated with the March 2003 refinancing, discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.

The tax benefit recorded in 2004 differs from the benefit in 2003 primarily as a result of significantly higher pre tax income, partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion. The 2004 tax benefit also included a net $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on those NOLs and alternative minimum tax credits. We evaluated and assessed the expected near term utilization of NOLs, book and taxable income trends, available tax strategies and the overall deferred tax position to determine the amount and timing of valuation allowance adjustments; a $2.8 million loss, net of tax, from discontinued operations in 2004 due to costs to resolve a contract indemnification claim related to our former Citizens Power subsidiary; lower minority interests during 2004 due to the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the recession of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook Events Impacting Near Term Operations Despite setting new industry records, shipments from our Powder River mines were lower than expected during 2005 due to a remedial maintenance program undertaken by the two railroad companies serving the Powder River Basin. The maintenance and repairs are expected to continue into 2006. We 60 Table of Contents expect these repairs may restrict shipments from our Powder River operations during 2006, but continue to anticipate higher shipment levels than 2005. Metallurgical coal production from our Appalachia operations is expected to be lower than prior year periods through the first quarter of 2006 as a metallurgical coal mine in our Appalachia segment continues development work and moves to new reserves. The longwall at the existing mine has depleted the final panel of available reserves in its current location and is relocating to a reserve extension in the first half of 2006. Following the longwall move, production of domestic metallurgical coal is expected to improve and finish the year with production equal to, or greater than, that of 2005. Our North Goonyella Mine in Australia has experienced difficult geologic conditions in 2005 and experienced a roof fall that interrupted production for portions of the third and fourth quarters. In the first quarter of 2006, we plan to install new longwall equipment to maximize operating performance under these adverse geologic conditions. We plan to meet our shipping commitments from this mine by supplementing its output with production from our newly opened, adjacent surface operation. In May 2005, we were notified of a reduced port allocation that is aimed at improving the loading of vessels and reducing demurrage at the main port for our Australian coal operations. Although port congestion has been reduced, high demurrage costs and unpredictable timing of vessel loading could continue to impact future results. Outlook Overview Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as growth continues in the U.S., Asia and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the third quarter of 2005 as reported by the U.S. Commerce Department, and Chinas economy grew 9.4% as published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Strong demand for coal and coal based electricity generation in the U.S. is being driven by the growing economy, low customer stockpiles, favorable weather, capacity constraints of nuclear generation and high prices of natural gas and oil. The high price of natural gas is leading some coal fueled generating plants to operate at increased levels. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that the high price of oil will lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including coal to liquids (CTL), and that coal will begin to displace natural gas fired generation of electricity, including the addition of CTL plants. At year end, U.S. electricity generator coal inventories were at the lowest level in the past five years. Demand for Powder River Basin coal is increasing, particularly for our ultra low sulfur products. The Powder River Basin represents more than half of our production, and the published reference price for high Btu, ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal has increased substantially, tripling during 2005. We control approximately 3.5 billion tons of proven and probable reserves in the Southern Powder River Basin and sold 125.7 million tons of coal from this region during the year ended December 31, 2005. Customers have indicated that demand for Powder River Basin coal could increase by 15% or more during 2006, although the railroads expect that they will be able to accommodate only about half of the expected increase in demand. Metallurgical coal continues to sell at a significant premium to steam coal and metallurgical markets remain strong as global steel production grew 6% to 7% in 2005. We expect to capitalize on the strong global market for metallurgical coal primarily through production and sales of metallurgical coal from our Appalachia operations and our Australian operations. We are targeting 2006 production of 230 million to 240 million tons and total sales volume of 255 million to 265 million tons, including 12 to 14 million tons of metallurgical coal. As of December 31, 2005, our unpriced volumes for produced tonnage for 2006 were 15 to 25 million tons. Management expects strong market conditions and operating performance to overcome external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs. In addition, historically low long term interest 61 Table of Contents rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities Our subsidiaries have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs, workers compensation obligations and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 16, 17 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, for these liabilities totaled $193.8 million, while payments were $147.1 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate (dollars in thousands): One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 8,789 $ (6,961 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 161,903 $ (135,501 ) 62 Table of Contents Discount rate (dollars in thousands): One Half One Half Percentage Point Percentage Point Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 1,183 $ (1,563 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (68,900 ) $ 75,878 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.99 years at December 31, 2005. Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $35.9 million, and payments totaled $33.6 million. See detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest, as considered appropriate by management. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Additional details regarding the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in Note 13. 63 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 98% of our revenue in 2005 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these agreements, risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessels, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal in over the counter markets. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal and emission allowance positions. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Ninety nine percent of the contracts in our trading portfolio as of December 31, 2005 were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials, and one percent of our contracts were valued based on similar market transactions. As of December 31, 2005, 76% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2006. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statement for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable through our securitization program. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as planned acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends, among other things, are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. We typically fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations, and during 2005 and 2004 we had no borrowings outstanding under our $900.0 million revolving line of credit, which we use primarily for standby letters of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities was $702.8 million in 2005, an increase of $419.0 million, or 147.6%, from 2004. The increase was primarily driven by stronger operational performance in 2005, as net income increased $247.3 million from the prior year. Also contributing to the increase was lower funding of pension plans in 2005, as we voluntarily pre funded $50.0 million in the prior year. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher working capital cash flows of $85.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $584.2 million during 2005 compared to $705.0 million used in 2004. Total capital expenditures were $643.9 million in 2005, an increase of $377.3 million over prior year. In 2005, we purchased mining and related assets of $141.2 million, which included $56.5 million for 64 Table of Contents the acquisition of coal reserves in Illinois and Indiana along with surface property and equipment and $84.7 million for the acquisition of mining and transportation infrastructure in the Powder River Basin. Our $118.4 million in federal coal lease expenditures in 2005 were similar to the 2004 expenditures. Other capital expenditures of $384.3 million were $232.4 million higher than the prior year. The 2005 other capital expenditures included the longwall equipment and mine development at our Australian mines, longwall replacement at our Twentymile mine, the opening of new mines and upgrading of existing mines in the Midwest and Appalachia, and expansion equipment. In 2005, we were able to make several acquisitions of strategic coal reserves and mining assets due to the strong operating results that we experienced in 2005. Proceeds from the disposal of assets increased $36.9 million primarily due to higher proceeds in 2005 from the sale of PVR units and non strategic property, reserves and equipment. In 2004, we acquired the Twentymile mine in Colorado and two mines in Australia for $421.3 million and made a $5.0 million earn out payment related to our April 2003 acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Black Beauty Coal Company. In December 2004, we acquired a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and manages the Paso Diablo mine in Venezuela, for a net purchase price of $32.5 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $4.9 million in 2005 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $693.4 million in the prior year, with the decrease primarily related to the 2004 issuance of 35.3 million shares of common stock at $11.25 per share, netting proceeds of $383.1 million; issuance of $250 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due in 2016; and the payment of debt issuance costs of $12.9 million in connection with the acquisition of the three mines discussed above. During 2004, we also completed a repricing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of an amended $450.0 million Term Loan and the $900 million Revolving Credit Facility. During 2005 and 2004, we made scheduled payments on our long term debt of $20.2 and $36.3 million, respectively. Securitized interest in accounts receivable increased by $25.0 million in 2005 compared to an increase of $110.0 million in 2004. We paid dividends of $44.5 million and $32.6 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, we issued $11.5 million in notes payable as part of an asset exchange in which we acquired additional Illinois Basin coal reserves. A detailed discussion of our debt instruments is included in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our total indebtedness consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2005 2004 Term Loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility $ 442,500 $ 448,750 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 239,525 239,525 Fair value of interest rate swaps 6.875% Senior Notes (8,879 ) 5,189 5.0% Subordinated Note 66,693 73,621 Other 15,667 7,880 Total $ 1,405,506 $ 1,424,965 On May 9, 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC, which was declared effective in June 2005. The universal shelf registration statement permits us to offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate maximum of $3 billion of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Related proceeds could be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of other debt, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions and any other purposes that may be stated in any prospectus supplement. As of December 31, 2005, no securities had been issued under the universal shelf registration statement, which remains effective. As of December 31, 2005, we had letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility of $406.7 million, leaving $493.3 million available for borrowing. This provides us with available borrowing capacity under the line of credit to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs. We were in 65 Table of Contents compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes and the 5.875% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2005. In May 2003, we entered into and designated four interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $100.0 million as a fair value hedge of our 6.875% Senior Notes. Under the swaps, we pay a floating rate that resets each March 15 and September 15, based upon the six month LIBOR rate, for a period of ten years ending March 15, 2013, and receives a fixed rate of 6.875%. The average applicable floating rate of the four swaps was 7.09% as of December 31, 2005. In September 2003, we entered into two $400.0 million interest rate swaps. One $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2010, was designated as a hedge of changes in expected cash flows on the term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under this swap we pay a fixed rate of 6.764% and receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% (6.99% at December 31, 2005) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate. Another $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2013, was designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Under this swap, we pay a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.97% (6.46% at December 31, 2005) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The swaps will lower our overall borrowing costs on $400.0 million of debt principal by 0.64% over the term of the floating to fixed swap. This results in annualized interest savings of $2.6 million over the term of the fixed to floating swap. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Year Within After 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 108,189 $ 252,518 $ 538,730 $ 1,048,169 Capital lease obligations 790 763 Operating leases obligations 84,031 139,905 75,435 103,506 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 129,522 8,993 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 203,840 398,423 149,996 44,094 Other long term liabilities(2) 168,775 327,754 370,093 961,997 Total contractual cash obligations $ 695,147 $ 1,128,356 $ 1,134,254 $ 2,157,766 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We had $138.5 million of purchase obligations related to future capital expenditures at December 31, 2005. Commitments for coal reserve related capital expenditures, including Federal Coal Leases, are included in Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations in the table above. Total capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to range from $450 million to $525 million, excluding Federal Coal Lease payments. Approximately 60% of projected 2006 capital expenditures relates to replacement, improvement, or expansion of existing mines, particularly in Appalachia and the Midwest. The remainder of the expenditures relate to growth initiatives such as increasing capacity in the Powder 66 Table of Contents River Basin. We anticipate funding these capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related and reclamation liabilities included above are expected to be funded from operating cash flow, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases and coal reserves. We believe the risk of generating lower than anticipated operating cash flow in 2006 is reduced by our high level of sales commitments, improved pricing and ongoing efforts to improve our operating cost structure. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions): Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total Self Bonding $ 671.8 $ $ $ $ 2.9 $ 674.7 Surety Bonds 335.6 258.8 19.2 28.4 642.0 Letters of Credit 0.1 22.7 144.6 120.1 119.7 407.2 $ 1,007.5 $ 281.5 $ 163.8 $ 120.1 $ 151.0 $ 1,723.9 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and collateral for surety companies. We have guaranteed $9.8 million of debt of an affiliate in which we have a 49% equity investment. We have also provided guarantees to small coal mining companies in order to facilitate their efforts to obtain bonding or financing. These guarantees arose as part of exclusive sales representation agreements with the small coal mining companies and totaled $5.5 million as of December 31, 2005. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of guarantees and indemnifications. In March 2000, we established an accounts receivable securitization program. Under the program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We used proceeds from the sale of the accounts receivable to repay long term debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The securitization program is scheduled to expire in September 2009, and the maximum amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable that may be sold to the Conduit is $225.0 million. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheet. The funding cost of the securitization program was $2.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the third quarter of 2005, we renegotiated certain terms of the program, including lowering the program pricing, removing a minimum balance requirement and adding the ability to issue letters of credit under the program. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $225.0 million and $200.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A detailed description of our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. 67 Table of Contents The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 900,000 $ 900,000 Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented In March 2005, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 04 6, Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry, which states that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. Advance stripping costs include those costs necessary to remove overburden above an unmined coal seam as part of the surface mining process, and are included as the work in process component of Inventories in the consolidated balance sheets ($245.5 million and $197.2 million as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively see Note 10). This is consistent with the concepts embodied in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins, which provides that the term inventory embraces goods awaiting sale. . ., goods in the course of production (work in process), and goods to be consumed directly or indirectly in production. . . . At the June 15 16, 2005 EITF meeting, the Task Force clarified that the intended meaning of inventory produced is inventory extracted. Based on this clarification, stripping costs incurred during a period will be attributed only to the inventory costs of the coal that is extracted during that same period. Due to physical loadout constraints and potential combustion issues, coal in most of our operations is not removed from the open pit until it is ready to ship; therefore, we will have little inventory on our balance sheet after implementing this interpretation. We expect this accounting treatment will introduce volatility in our earnings as costs associated with preparing coal for sale may be expensed before the coal is sold, and likewise, sales may be made with little to no cost matched to the sale. EITF Issue No. 04 6 is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 (January 1, 2006 for us). At the June 2005 EITF meeting, the Task Force modified the transition provisions of EITF Issue No. 04 6, indicating that companies that adopt in periods beginning after June 29, 2005 may utilize a cumulative effect adjustment approach where the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded directly to retained earnings in the year of adoption. If we had implemented the cumulative effect adjustment approach at December 31, 2005, the reduction to retained earnings, net of tax, would have been $150.6 million. We adopted EITF Issue No. 04 6 on January 1, 2006. On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 1239(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Income tax benefits from stock options exercised will be included in financing activities in the statement of cash flows rather than operating activities. In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission deferred the adoption date of SFAS No. 123(R) to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2006, and used the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. Based on stock 68 Table of Contents option grants made in 2005 (and years prior) and currently anticipated for 2006, we estimate we will recognize stock option expense for the year ending December 31, 2006, of $5.6 million, net of taxes. We began utilizing restricted stock as part of our equity based compensation strategy in January 2005. Based on the restricted stock grants made in 2005 and years prior, we recognized expense related to restricted stock of $1.0 million, net of taxes, in 2005. Accounting for restricted stock awards is not affected by the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal trading, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes, and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards at December 31, 2005, and included forwards and swaps at December 31, 2004. Our policy for accounting for coal trading activities is described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both option and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the actual low, high and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $1.2 million, $3.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. During the year ended 69 Table of Contents December 31, 2004, the actual low, high and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.5 million, $6.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Percentage Year of Expiration of Portfolio 2006 76 % 2007 23 % 2008 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. In the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2006 involves hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2005, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling A$915.8 million of which A$434.8 million, A$300.0 million and A$181.0 million will expire in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Our current expectation for 2006 non capital, Australian dollar denominated cash expenditures is approximately $633 million. A change in the Australian dollar/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of US$0.01 (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of $6.3 million per year. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $860.7 million of fixed rate borrowings and $544.8 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $5.4 million on our variable rate 70 Table of Contents borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $52.1 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2005 and 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had 15 to 25 million tons, 90 to 100 million tons and 155 to 165 million tons for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, of expected production (including steam and metallurgical coal production) available for sale or repricing at market prices. We have an annual metallurgical coal production capacity of 12 to 14 million tons. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. In addition, we utilize derivative contracts to hedge our commodity price exposure. As of December 31, 2005, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel. Notional amounts outstanding under these contracts, scheduled to expire through 2007, were 44.5 million gallons of heating oil and 24.4 million gallons of crude oil. Overall, we have fixed prices for approximately 50% of our anticipated diesel fuel requirements in 2006. We expect to consume 95 to 100 million gallons of fuel per year. On a per gallon basis, based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our operating costs of approximately $1 million per year. Alternatively, a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $2.3 million. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 34 active coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions and internationally in Australia. In 2005, we sold 239.9 million tons of coal that accounted for an estimated 21.5% of all U.S. coal sales, and were more than 69% greater than the sales of our closest domestic competitor and 49% more than our closest international competitor. Based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, demand for coal in the United States was more than 1.1 billion tons in 2005. Domestic consumption of coal is expected to grow at a rate of 1.7% per year through 2030 when U.S. coal demand is forecasted to be 1.8 billion tons. The EIA expects demand for coal use at coal to liquids (CTL) plants to grow to 190 million tons by 2030. Coal fueled generation is used in most cases to meet baseload electricity requirements, and coal use generally grows at the approximate rate of electricity growth, which is expected to average 1.6% annually through 2025. Coal production from west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth as Western production increases to a 63% share of total production in 2030. In 2004, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 51%, a share that the EIA projects will grow to 57% by 2030. Our primary customers are U.S. utilities, which accounted for 87% of our sales in 2005. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2005, approximately 90% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2005, our unpriced volumes for 2006 were 15 to 25 million tons on expected production of 230 to 240 million tons and total sales of 255 to 265 million tons. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risks Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity 49 Table of Contents generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Eastern U.S. Mining, Western U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Appalachia and Midwest operations, and our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. The principal business of the Western U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. The principal business of the Eastern U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities, as well as the mining of some metallurgical coal, sold to steel and coke producers. Geologically, Eastern operations mine bituminous and Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Our Australian Mining operations consist of our North Goonyella underground mine and our Wilkie Creek, Burton and Eaglefield surface mines. Eaglefield is a surface operation adjacent to, and fulfilling contract tonnages in conjunction with, the North Goonyella underground mine. In the first quarter of 2006, we will begin production at the 0.6 million ton per year Baralaba Mine, of which we own a 62.5% interest. The Baralaba Mine will produce PCI, a substitute for metallurgical coal, and steam coal. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining low sulfur, high Btu coal sold to an international customer base. Primarily, metallurgical coal is produced from our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 5% of our total sales volume and approximately 2% of U.S. sales volume. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 6 to 8 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. Each of our mining operations is described in Item 1 of this report. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 85% of revenues in 2005, we also generate revenues from brokering and trading coal (15% of revenues), and by creating value from our vast natural resource position by selling non core land holdings and mineral interests to generate additional cash flows as well as other ventures described below. We continue to pursue the development of coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. The projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to equity partner, contract miner or coal lessor. The projects we are currently pursuing are as follows: the 1,500 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in Washington County, Illinois; the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky; and the 300 megawatt Mustang Energy Project near Grants, New Mexico. The plants, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. The first of these plants would not be operational earlier than mid 2010. In February 2005, a group of Midwest rural electric cooperatives and municipal joint action agencies entered into definitive agreements to acquire 47% of the Prairie State Energy Campus project. After an initial appeal, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency reissued the air permit on April 28, 2005. The same parties who filed the earlier permit challenge filed a new appeal on June 8, 2005. We believe the permit was appropriately issued and expect to prevail in the appeal process. Various other required permits 50 Table of Contents are in process and may also be subject to challenge. If successfully completed, the Prairie State Energy Campus project would utilize approximately six million tons of coal each year. During 2005, we engaged in several BTU conversion projects which are designed to expand the uses of coal through various technologies. We are a founding member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non profit company that is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy to facilitate the design, construction and operation of the worlds first near zero emission coal fueled power plant. FutureGen will demonstrate advanced coal based technologies to generate electricity and also produce hydrogen to power fuel cells for transportation and other energy needs. The technology also will integrate the capture of carbon emissions with carbon sequestration, helping to address the issue of climate change as energy demand continues to grow worldwide. We also entered into an agreement to acquire a 30% interest in Econo Power International Corporation (EPICtm), which owns and markets modular coal gasifiers for industrial applications. The EPIC Clean Coal Gasification Systemtm uses air blown gasifiers to convert coal into a synthetic gas that is ideal for industrial applications. In late 2005, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC to advance project development of a commercial scale coal gasification project in Illinois that would transform coal into pipeline quality synthetic natural gas. The initial project would be designed with ConocoPhillips E Gastm Technology. When completed, the plant would be one of the largest coal to natural gas plants in the United States and would require at least three million tons of Illinois Basin coal per year to fuel two gasifier trains that could produce more than 35 billion cubic feet of synthetic natural gas. Effective January 1, 2006, Gregory H. Boyce became our President and Chief Executive Officer after we completed an orderly succession planning process. Irl F. Engelhardt, our former Chief Executive Officer, remains employed as Chairman of the Board. Effective March 1, 2005, Mr. Boyce was also elected to the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board. Effective March 30, 2005, we implemented a two for one stock split on all shares of our common stock. Subsequently, on February 22, 2006, we implemented another two for one stock split on all shares of our then outstanding common stock. All share and per share amounts in this annual report on Form 10 K reflect both stock splits. During July 2005, we increased our quarterly dividend 27% to $0.0475 per share and our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. On January 23, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a 26% increase in our dividend, to $0.06 per share, to shareholders of record on February 7, 2006. In July 2005, the Board of Directors elected John F. Turner as an independent director who serves on the Boards Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Turner is former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) within the State Department and is the past President and Chief Executive Officer of the Conservation Fund, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to public private partnerships to protect land and water resources. He has also served as the Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with responsibility for increasing wetland protection and establishing 55 National Wildlife Refuges, the most of any administration in the nations history. Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations in 2005 and 2004 below includes references to, and analysis of, our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable 51 Table of Contents measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 27 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Summary Our 2005 revenues of $4.64 billion increased 27.9% over the prior year. Revenues were driven higher by improved pricing in all of our mining operations and another year of industry record sales volume with 239.9 million tons sold compared to 227.2 million tons in 2004. For the year, Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion was a 39.5% increase over the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in the current year due to increases in sales volumes and prices at our U.S. and Australian Mining Operations. Results in our Western U.S. Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado. Results in our Australian Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Burton and North Goonyella Mines as well as the opening of the Eaglefield Mine adjacent to the North Goonyella Mine in the fourth quarter of 2004. Our Corporate and Other segment includes results from our December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. In addition, higher gains on property transactions contributed to higher year over year results. Net income was $422.7 million in 2005, or $1.58 per share, an increase of 141.0% over 2004 net income of $175.4 million, or $0.69 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended Increase December 31, (Decrease) 2005 2004 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 154.3 142.2 12.1 8.5 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 52.5 51.7 0.8 1.5 % Australian Mining Operations 8.3 6.1 2.2 36.1 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 24.8 27.2 (2.4 ) (8.8 )% Total 239.9 227.2 12.7 5.6 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Increase Year Ended Year Ended to Revenues December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 4,545,323 $ 3,545,027 $ 1,000,296 28.2 % Other revenues 99,130 86,555 12,575 14.5 % Total revenues $ 4,644,453 $ 3,631,582 $ 1,012,871 27.9 % Our revenues increased by $1.01 billion, or 27.9%, to $4.64 billion compared to prior year. The three mines we acquired in the second quarter of 2004 contributed $365.2 million of revenue growth due to the additional 105 days of operations in 2005 compared to the prior year. The remaining $647.7 million 52 Table of Contents of revenue growth was driven by higher sales prices and volumes across all mining segments and improved volumes in our brokerage operations. Sales increased 28.2% to $4.55 billion in 2005, reflecting increases in every operating segment. Western U.S. Mining sales increased $222.2 million, Eastern U.S. Mining sales were $224.0 million higher, sales in Australia Mining improved $328.0 million and sales from our brokerage operations increased $226.0 million. Sales in every segment increased on improved pricing, and volumes were higher in every segment other than Trading and Brokerage. Our average sales price per ton increased 17.4% during 2005 due to increased demand for all of our coal products, which drove pricing higher, particularly in the regions where we produce metallurgical coal. Prices for metallurgical coal and our ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal have been the subject of increasing demand. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. We sell ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal from our Western U.S. Mining operations. The sales mix also improved due to an increase in sales from our Australian Mining segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets due primarily to a higher proportion of metallurgical coal production in the Australian segment sales mix. The increase in Eastern U.S. Mining operations sales was primarily due to improved pricing for both steam and metallurgical coal from the region. Sales in Appalachia increased $118.6 million, or 17.1% and sales in the Midwest increased $105.4 million, or 13.6%. On average, prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased 14.1% to $33.10 per ton. Production increases in the Midwest were partially offset by lower production in Appalachia compared to the prior year. Most of the decrease in production in Appalachia occurred during the fourth quarter as our largest metallurgical coal mine worked to develop a new section and relocate its longwall. Sales increased in our Western U.S. Mining operations due to higher demand driven volumes and prices. Overall, prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased 6.6% to $10.45 per ton. In the West, sales increased the most in the Powder River Basin, which improved $149.8 million due to increased sales prices and volumes. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of increasingly strong demand for the mines low sulfur product, which continues to expand its market area geographically. Powder River Basin operations were able to ship record volumes during 2005 by overcoming train derailments and weather and track maintenance disruptions on the main shipping line out of the basin. Our Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, helped our Colorado operations contribute an additional $67.3 million to sales compared to prior year due to an additional four months of ownership, higher prices and increased mine productivity. Sales from our Southwestern operations, where the Black Mesa Mine closed at the end of 2005, were comparable to prior year. Sales from our Australian Mining operations were $328.0 million, or 122.1%, higher than in 2004. The increase in Australian sales was due primarily to a 63.3% increase in per ton sales prices largely due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, an increase in volumes which included the opening of our Eaglefield surface mine at the end of 2004, and $197.6 million of incremental sales from the two mines we acquired in April 2004 due to 105 additional days of operations in 2005 compared to 2004. Our Trading and Brokerage operations sales increased $226.0 million in 2005 compared to prior year due to an increase in average per ton prices and higher eastern U.S. and international brokerage volumes. Other revenues increased $12.6 million, or 14.5%, compared to prior year primarily due to proceeds from a purchase contract restructuring and higher synthetic fuel revenues in the Midwest. 53 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion for 2005 was $305.5 million higher than 2004 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million, and was composed of the following: Increase to Segment Year Ended Year Ended Adjusted EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 459,039 $ 402,052 $ 56,987 14.2 % Eastern U.S. Mining 374,628 280,357 94,271 33.6 % Australian Mining 202,582 50,372 152,210 302.2 % Trading and Brokerage 43,058 41,039 2,019 4.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $57.0 million during 2005 due to a margin per ton increase of $0.15, or 5.3%, and a sales volume increase of 12.1 million tons. The Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, contributed $25.4 million more to Adjusted EBITDA in 2005 than in 2004, due to four months of incremental ownership and a 22.2% increase in per ton margin. The remaining increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by our Powder River Basin operations, which improved by $53.5 million and earned 12.3% higher per ton margins while increasing volumes 8.5% in response to greater demand for our low sulfur products. Improved revenues overcame increased unit costs that resulted from higher fuel costs, lower than anticipated volume due to rail difficulties and an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes. Improvements in the Powder River Basin and Colorado overcame a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $13.5 million for our Southwest operations primarily due to lower volume and higher fuel costs. Pricing improvements in the Powder River Basin generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $94.3 million, or 33.6%, compared to prior year primarily due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.71, or 31.5%. Our Appalachia operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $44.2 million, or 29.8%, as a result of sales price increases, partially offset by lower production at two of our mines and higher costs related to geologic issues, contract mining and roof support. Results in our Midwest operations were improved $50.1 million, or 37.9%, compared to prior year as benefits of higher volumes and prices were partially offset by higher costs due to higher fuel, repair and maintenance costs and the impact of heavy rainfall on surface operations early in the year. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $152.2 million in the current year, a 302.2% increase compared to prior year due to an increase of $16.23, or 197.4%, in margin per ton and 2.2 million additional tons shipped. Our Australian operations produce mostly (75% to 85%) high margin metallurgical coal. The two mines we acquired in April 2004 added $87.4 million to Adjusted EBITDA compared to eight months of ownership in 2004. The remaining increase of $64.8 million was primarily due to an increase in volume, including tonnage from our surface operation opened at the end of the prior year, and an increase of 63.3% in average per ton sale price. While current year margins benefited from strong sales prices, margin growth was limited by the impact of port congestion, related demurrage costs and higher costs due to geological problems at the underground mine. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.0 million from the prior year primarily due to higher brokerage results. Results in 2005 included a net charge of $4.0 million, primarily related to the breach of a coal supply contract by a producer (see Note 3). 54 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (208,909 ) (214,576 ) 5,667 2.6 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (316,114 ) (270,159 ) (45,955 ) (17.0 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (35,901 ) (42,387 ) 6,486 15.3 % Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) 1,751 n/a Interest expense (102,939 ) (96,793 ) (6,146 ) (6.3 )% Interest income 10,641 4,917 5,724 116.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interest of $426.1 million for the current year is $273.0 million, or 178.4%, higher than prior year primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Increases in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense offset improvements in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, asset retirement obligation expense, debt extinguishment costs and interest income. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our Venezuelan joint venture, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. The $5.7 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2005 compared to 2004 included: net gains on asset sales that were $77.7 million higher than prior year primarily due to a $37.4 million gain from a property exchange related to settlement of a contract dispute with a third party coal supplier (see Note 3), sales of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P. (PVR) units ($31.1 million) (see Note 11), resource sales involving non strategic coal assets and properties ($12.5 million), and an asset exchange in which we acquired Illinois Basin coal reserves ($6.2 million). The gain from PVR unit sales in 2005 was from the sale of all of our remaining 0.838 million units compared to a gain of $15.8 million on the sale of 0.775 million units in two separate transactions during 2004. All other gains on asset disposals in 2005 and 2004 were $14.3 million and $8.0 million, respectively; higher equity income of $18.7 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guassare (acquired in December 2004), which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela, and; lower net expenses related to generation development of $5.1 million, primarily due to reimbursements from the Prairie State Energy Campus partnership group. These improvements were partially offset by: a $36.0 million increase in past mining obligations expense, primarily related to higher retiree health care costs. The increase in retiree health care costs was actuarially driven by higher trend rates, and lower interest discount assumptions and higher amortization of actuarial losses in 2005, and; an increase of $46.8 million in selling and administrative expenses primarily related to accruals for higher short term and long term performance based incentive plans ($32.2 million). These incentives are principally long term plans that are driven by total shareholder returns. Our share price increased 104% during 2005, significantly outperforming industrial benchmarks and our coal 55 Table of Contents peer group average. The remaining increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to higher personnel and outside services costs needed to advance our growth initiatives in areas such as China and BTU conversion, acquisitions and regulatory costs (e.g. Sarbanes Oxley), and an increase in advertising costs related to an industry awareness campaign launched in late 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $46.0 million during 2005. Approximately 56% of the increase was due to acquisitions completed during 2004 and the remainder was from increased volumes at existing mines and operations opened during 2005. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased $6.5 million in 2005 due to additional expenses incurred in 2004 to accelerate the planned reclamation of certain closed mine sites. Interest expense increased $6.1 million primarily related to a full year of interest in 2005 on $250 million of 5.875% Senior Notes issued in late March of 2004 and increases in the cost of floating rate debt due to higher interest rates. Interest income improved $5.7 million due to higher yields on short term interest rates and an increase in invested balances due to improved cash flows during 2005. Net Income Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended Year Ended Income December 31, December 31, 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4 % Income tax benefit (provision) (960 ) 26,437 (27,397 ) (103.6 )% Minority interests (2,472 ) (1,282 ) (1,190 ) (92.8 )% Income from continuing operations 422,653 178,226 244,427 137.1 % Loss from discontinued operations (2,839 ) 2,839 n/a Net income $ 422,653 $ 175,387 $ 247,266 141.0 % Net income increased $247.3 million, or 141.0%, compared to the prior year due to the increase in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, partially offset by increases in our income tax provision. The income tax benefit in 2004 included a $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs) and alternative minimum tax credits. The income tax provision in 2005 was higher based on the increase in pretax income which was partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion and the partial benefit of tax loss from a deemed liquidation of a subsidiary arising as an indirect consequence of a comprehensive and strategic internal restructuring we completed during 2005. This restructuring resulted from efforts to better align corporate ownership of subsidiaries on a geographic and functional basis. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Summary In 2004, our revenues increased to $3.63 billion, 29.0% higher than 2003, led by improved pricing and an industry record sales volume of 227.2 million tons. Mines acquired in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of sales and 11.0 million tons to our 2004 results. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for 2004 totaled $773.8 million, a 28.1% increase over $603.9 million in the prior year. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was higher in 2004 due to increased sales volumes and prices. Net income in 2004 was $175.4 million, or $0.69 per share, an increase of 459.5% over 2003 net income of $31.3 million, or $0.14 per share. The increase in net income was primarily due to improved operating results and acquisitions in 2004, and the impact in 2003 of $53.5 million in pretax early debt extinguishment charges and a $10.1 million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting changes. 56 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2004 2003 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 142.2 129.6 12.6 9.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 51.7 46.3 5.4 11.7 % Australian Mining Operations 6.1 1.3 4.8 369.2 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 27.2 26.0 1.2 4.6 % Total 227.2 203.2 24.0 11.8 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Increase to Year Ended Year Ended Revenues December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 3,545,027 $ 2,729,323 $ 815,704 29.9 % Other revenues 86,555 85,973 582 0.7 % Total revenues $ 3,631,582 $ 2,815,296 $ 816,286 29.0 % Revenues increased by 29.0%, or $816.3 million, over 2003. The acquisition of three mines in April 2004 contributed $335.0 million of total revenue and 11.0 million tons during the year. Excluding revenues from acquisitions during 2004, U.S. Mining revenues increased $375.4 million, and revenues from our brokerage operations increased $110.9 million on higher pricing and volume worldwide. Our average sales price per ton increased 14.6% during 2004 due to increased overall demand, which has driven pricing higher, most notably in Appalachia, and a change in sales mix. The sales mix has benefited from the increase in sales from the Australian segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets. In addition to geographic mix changes, our 2004 revenues included a greater proportion of higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Pricing of metallurgical coal responded to increased international demand for the product. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. Other revenues were relatively unchanged from 2003. In our Eastern U.S. Mining operations, revenues increased $302.8 million, or 25.3%, as a result of higher pricing and volumes from strong steam and metallurgical coal demand. Production increases at most eastern mines more than offset lower than expected production at certain of our mines and from contract sources as a result of geologic difficulties and from congestion related shipping delays and hurricane related production disruptions and delays to rail and export shipments. Appalachian revenues led the Eastern U.S. increase, benefiting the most from price increases while also increasing production and sales volumes. Revenues in Appalachia increased $188.1 million, or 37.0%, while in the Midwest, revenues increased by $114.7 million, or 16.6%. Revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $171.6 million, or 14.0%, on both increased volumes and prices. However, the primary driver of increased revenues in the West was a 12.6 million ton increase in sales volume. Growth in volumes were primarily in the Powder River Basin operations, where revenues were up $58.6 million, or 7.5%, and from the addition of the Twentymile Mine in April 2004, which added $99.0 million to sales. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of stronger demand for the mines low sulfur product, which overcame difficulties with rail service, downtime at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine to upgrade the loading facility and poor weather, which impaired production early in the year. Revenues in our Australian 57 Table of Contents Mining operations increased $241.5 million compared to 2003 due primarily to the acquisition of two operating mines during 2004 and benefiting from higher overall pricing for our products there. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million for 2004 was $169.9 million higher than 2003 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $603.9 million, and was composed of the following: Increase (Decrease) to Segment Adjusted Year Ended Year Ended EBITDA December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining $ 402,052 $ 356,898 $ 45,154 12.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining 280,357 198,964 81,393 40.9 % Australian Mining 50,372 2,225 48,147 2163.9 % Trading and Brokerage 41,039 45,828 (4,789 ) (10.4 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,820 $ 603,915 $ 169,905 28.1 % Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $45.2 million during 2004, margin per ton increased $0.07, or 2.5%, while sales volume increased 12.6 million tons. The April 2004 acquisition of the Twentymile Mine contributed to $31.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA increase and sales volume, adding 6.2 million tons of the volume increase in 2004. An increase of $20.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA in the Powder River Basin, due primarily to increases in sales volume, contributed most of the remaining improvement in the West. Our Powder River Basin operations continued to benefit from strong demand, leading to record shipping levels which overcame the effects of a planned outage earlier in the year to increase throughput at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine, rail service problems throughout the year and the shutdown of our Big Sky Mine at the end of 2003. Results in the Southwest approximated 2003 levels. Pricing improvements generally offset higher costs for fuel and explosives. Adjusted EBITDA from our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased $81.4 million, or 40.9%, compared to 2003 due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.11, or 25.8%, and an increase in volume by 5.4 million, or 11.7%. Improved pricing led to increased margins in our Eastern operations, despite higher processing costs incurred to upgrade from steam to metallurgical quality, the cost of substitute coal purchases to enable production to be sold in higher value metallurgical coal markets, hurricane related transportation and production interruption and increased fuel and steel costs. Appalachia operations drove the improvement in the East with a $101.5 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Appalachia region benefited from strong demand driven pricing and volume and increased higher priced metallurgical coal sales. Our operations in Appalachia also benefited during the current year from $21.0 million in insurance recoveries, more than offsetting higher costs due to equipment and geologic difficulties at a mine in Kentucky and a $9.6 million increase in earnings from our equity interest in a joint venture. Adjusted EBITDA in the Midwest was $20.1 million less than 2003 as increased production and sales, as well as higher overall sales prices, did not overcome poor geologic conditions at certain mines, higher equipment repair costs and higher fuel and steel costs. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $48.1 million in 2004. Our acquisition of two mines in April 2004 added 4.8 million tons and increased overall sales volume to 6.1 million tons. Most of the increase in sales tonnage was in higher margin metallurgical coal sales, driving a margin per ton increase of $6.55, or nearly 400%. The acquisitions in 2004 contributed $43.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA to results for the year. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.8 million from 2003 primarily due to higher brokerage results in 2003. Adjusted EBITDA from trading activities increased over 2003 due to improved pricing on our long position, and pure brokerage results improved on higher pricing and volumes, particularly in international brokerage. 58 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended Year Ended to Income December 31, December 31, 2004 2003 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 773,820 $ 603,915 $ 169,905 28.1 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (214,576 ) (193,637 ) (20,939 ) (10.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (270,159 ) (234,336 ) (35,823 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (42,387 ) (31,156 ) (11,231 ) (36.0 )% Early debt extinguishment costs (1,751 ) (53,513 ) 51,762 96.7 % Interest expense (96,793 ) (98,540 ) 1,747 1.8 % Interest income 4,917 4,086 831 20.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes and minority interests $ 153,071 $ (3,181 ) $ 156,252 n/a Total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million for 2004 is compared with $603.9 million from 2003 in the discussion above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, resource management and our Venezuelan mining operations. The increase in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to: net gains on asset sales were $8.8 million higher in 2003, which included gains of $18.8 million on the sale of land, coal reserves and oil and gas rights, $6.4 million of other asset disposals, and $7.6 million from the sale of 1.15 million units of PVR, while 2004 included gains of only $8.0 million from other asset disposals and a $15.8 million gain from the sale of a total of 0.775 million units of PVR in two separate transactions; increased costs in 2004 for generation development ($5.3 million) related to the further development of the Prairie State and Thoroughbred Energy campuses; higher selling and administrative expenses of $34.5 million, primarily associated with higher long term incentive costs ($17.8 million), pensions, an increase in outside services costs (including costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act) and the impact of acquisitions during 2004; and a $2.9 million increase in our accrual for future environmental obligations. These increased costs compared to 2003 were partially offset by the gain on sale of PVR units discussed above and: lower costs ($29.0 million) in 2004 associated with past mining obligations, primarily lower retiree health care costs from the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and lower closed and suspended mine spending; contributions ($1.2 million) to Adjusted EBITDA from the December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $35.8 million during 2004 due to higher volume and acquisitions. Asset retirement obligation expense increased $11.2 million during 2004 due to increased or accelerated reclamation work at certain closed mine sites and the acquisition of additional mining operations. 59 Table of Contents Debt extinguishment costs were $51.8 million higher in 2003 due to the significant prepayment premiums associated with the March 2003 refinancing, discussed in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.

The tax benefit recorded in 2004 differs from the benefit in 2003 primarily as a result of significantly higher pre tax income, partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion. The 2004 tax benefit also included a net $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on those NOLs and alternative minimum tax credits. We evaluated and assessed the expected near term utilization of NOLs, book and taxable income trends, available tax strategies and the overall deferred tax position to determine the amount and timing of valuation allowance adjustments; a $2.8 million loss, net of tax, from discontinued operations in 2004 due to costs to resolve a contract indemnification claim related to our former Citizens Power subsidiary; lower minority interests during 2004 due to the acquisition in April 2003 of the remaining 18.3% of Black Beauty Coal Company; and a charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million, relating to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS No. 143), the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the recession of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, as discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Outlook Events Impacting Near Term Operations Despite setting new industry records, shipments from our Powder River mines were lower than expected during 2005 due to a remedial maintenance program undertaken by the two railroad companies serving the Powder River Basin. The maintenance and repairs are expected to continue into 2006. We 60 Table of Contents expect these repairs may restrict shipments from our Powder River operations during 2006, but continue to anticipate higher shipment levels than 2005. Metallurgical coal production from our Appalachia operations is expected to be lower than prior year periods through the first quarter of 2006 as a metallurgical coal mine in our Appalachia segment continues development work and moves to new reserves. The longwall at the existing mine has depleted the final panel of available reserves in its current location and is relocating to a reserve extension in the first half of 2006. Following the longwall move, production of domestic metallurgical coal is expected to improve and finish the year with production equal to, or greater than, that of 2005. Our North Goonyella Mine in Australia has experienced difficult geologic conditions in 2005 and experienced a roof fall that interrupted production for portions of the third and fourth quarters. In the first quarter of 2006, we plan to install new longwall equipment to maximize operating performance under these adverse geologic conditions. We plan to meet our shipping commitments from this mine by supplementing its output with production from our newly opened, adjacent surface operation. In May 2005, we were notified of a reduced port allocation that is aimed at improving the loading of vessels and reducing demurrage at the main port for our Australian coal operations. Although port congestion has been reduced, high demurrage costs and unpredictable timing of vessel loading could continue to impact future results. Outlook Overview Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as growth continues in the U.S., Asia and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% in the third quarter of 2005 as reported by the U.S. Commerce Department, and Chinas economy grew 9.4% as published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Strong demand for coal and coal based electricity generation in the U.S. is being driven by the growing economy, low customer stockpiles, favorable weather, capacity constraints of nuclear generation and high prices of natural gas and oil. The high price of natural gas is leading some coal fueled generating plants to operate at increased levels. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that the high price of oil will lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including coal to liquids (CTL), and that coal will begin to displace natural gas fired generation of electricity, including the addition of CTL plants. At year end, U.S. electricity generator coal inventories were at the lowest level in the past five years. Demand for Powder River Basin coal is increasing, particularly for our ultra low sulfur products. The Powder River Basin represents more than half of our production, and the published reference price for high Btu, ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal has increased substantially, tripling during 2005. We control approximately 3.5 billion tons of proven and probable reserves in the Southern Powder River Basin and sold 125.7 million tons of coal from this region during the year ended December 31, 2005. Customers have indicated that demand for Powder River Basin coal could increase by 15% or more during 2006, although the railroads expect that they will be able to accommodate only about half of the expected increase in demand. Metallurgical coal continues to sell at a significant premium to steam coal and metallurgical markets remain strong as global steel production grew 6% to 7% in 2005. We expect to capitalize on the strong global market for metallurgical coal primarily through production and sales of metallurgical coal from our Appalachia operations and our Australian operations. We are targeting 2006 production of 230 million to 240 million tons and total sales volume of 255 million to 265 million tons, including 12 to 14 million tons of metallurgical coal. As of December 31, 2005, our unpriced volumes for produced tonnage for 2006 were 15 to 25 million tons. Management expects strong market conditions and operating performance to overcome external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs. In addition, historically low long term interest 61 Table of Contents rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities Our subsidiaries have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs, workers compensation obligations and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 16, 17 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, for these liabilities totaled $193.8 million, while payments were $147.1 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate (dollars in thousands): One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 8,789 $ (6,961 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 161,903 $ (135,501 ) 62 Table of Contents Discount rate (dollars in thousands): One Half One Half Percentage Point Percentage Point Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 1,183 $ (1,563 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (68,900 ) $ 75,878 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.99 years at December 31, 2005. Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2005, was $35.9 million, and payments totaled $33.6 million. See detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest, as considered appropriate by management. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Additional details regarding the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in Note 13. 63 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 98% of our revenue in 2005 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these agreements, risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessels, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal in over the counter markets. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal and emission allowance positions. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Ninety nine percent of the contracts in our trading portfolio as of December 31, 2005 were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials, and one percent of our contracts were valued based on similar market transactions. As of December 31, 2005, 76% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2006. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statement for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable through our securitization program. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as planned acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends, among other things, are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. We typically fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations, and during 2005 and 2004 we had no borrowings outstanding under our $900.0 million revolving line of credit, which we use primarily for standby letters of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities was $702.8 million in 2005, an increase of $419.0 million, or 147.6%, from 2004. The increase was primarily driven by stronger operational performance in 2005, as net income increased $247.3 million from the prior year. Also contributing to the increase was lower funding of pension plans in 2005, as we voluntarily pre funded $50.0 million in the prior year. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher working capital cash flows of $85.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities was $584.2 million during 2005 compared to $705.0 million used in 2004. Total capital expenditures were $643.9 million in 2005, an increase of $377.3 million over prior year. In 2005, we purchased mining and related assets of $141.2 million, which included $56.5 million for 64 Table of Contents the acquisition of coal reserves in Illinois and Indiana along with surface property and equipment and $84.7 million for the acquisition of mining and transportation infrastructure in the Powder River Basin. Our $118.4 million in federal coal lease expenditures in 2005 were similar to the 2004 expenditures. Other capital expenditures of $384.3 million were $232.4 million higher than the prior year. The 2005 other capital expenditures included the longwall equipment and mine development at our Australian mines, longwall replacement at our Twentymile mine, the opening of new mines and upgrading of existing mines in the Midwest and Appalachia, and expansion equipment. In 2005, we were able to make several acquisitions of strategic coal reserves and mining assets due to the strong operating results that we experienced in 2005. Proceeds from the disposal of assets increased $36.9 million primarily due to higher proceeds in 2005 from the sale of PVR units and non strategic property, reserves and equipment. In 2004, we acquired the Twentymile mine in Colorado and two mines in Australia for $421.3 million and made a $5.0 million earn out payment related to our April 2003 acquisition of the remaining minority interest in Black Beauty Coal Company. In December 2004, we acquired a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and manages the Paso Diablo mine in Venezuela, for a net purchase price of $32.5 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $4.9 million in 2005 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $693.4 million in the prior year, with the decrease primarily related to the 2004 issuance of 35.3 million shares of common stock at $11.25 per share, netting proceeds of $383.1 million; issuance of $250 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due in 2016; and the payment of debt issuance costs of $12.9 million in connection with the acquisition of the three mines discussed above. During 2004, we also completed a repricing of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, consisting of an amended $450.0 million Term Loan and the $900 million Revolving Credit Facility. During 2005 and 2004, we made scheduled payments on our long term debt of $20.2 and $36.3 million, respectively. Securitized interest in accounts receivable increased by $25.0 million in 2005 compared to an increase of $110.0 million in 2004. We paid dividends of $44.5 million and $32.6 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, we issued $11.5 million in notes payable as part of an asset exchange in which we acquired additional Illinois Basin coal reserves. A detailed discussion of our debt instruments is included in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends are subject to limitations imposed by our 6.875% Senior Notes, 5.875% Senior Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility covenants. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our total indebtedness consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2005 2004 Term Loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility $ 442,500 $ 448,750 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 239,525 239,525 Fair value of interest rate swaps 6.875% Senior Notes (8,879 ) 5,189 5.0% Subordinated Note 66,693 73,621 Other 15,667 7,880 Total $ 1,405,506 $ 1,424,965 On May 9, 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC, which was declared effective in June 2005. The universal shelf registration statement permits us to offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate maximum of $3 billion of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Related proceeds could be used for general corporate purposes including repayment of other debt, capital expenditures, possible acquisitions and any other purposes that may be stated in any prospectus supplement. As of December 31, 2005, no securities had been issued under the universal shelf registration statement, which remains effective. As of December 31, 2005, we had letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility of $406.7 million, leaving $493.3 million available for borrowing. This provides us with available borrowing capacity under the line of credit to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs. We were in 65 Table of Contents compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes and the 5.875% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2005. In May 2003, we entered into and designated four interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $100.0 million as a fair value hedge of our 6.875% Senior Notes. Under the swaps, we pay a floating rate that resets each March 15 and September 15, based upon the six month LIBOR rate, for a period of ten years ending March 15, 2013, and receives a fixed rate of 6.875%. The average applicable floating rate of the four swaps was 7.09% as of December 31, 2005. In September 2003, we entered into two $400.0 million interest rate swaps. One $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2010, was designated as a hedge of changes in expected cash flows on the term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under this swap we pay a fixed rate of 6.764% and receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% (6.99% at December 31, 2005) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate. Another $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap, expiring March 15, 2013, was designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Under this swap, we pay a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.97% (6.46% at December 31, 2005) that resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate and receive a fixed rate of 6.875%. The swaps will lower our overall borrowing costs on $400.0 million of debt principal by 0.64% over the term of the floating to fixed swap. This results in annualized interest savings of $2.6 million over the term of the fixed to floating swap. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Payments Due by Year Within After 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 108,189 $ 252,518 $ 538,730 $ 1,048,169 Capital lease obligations 790 763 Operating leases obligations 84,031 139,905 75,435 103,506 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 129,522 8,993 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 203,840 398,423 149,996 44,094 Other long term liabilities(2) 168,775 327,754 370,093 961,997 Total contractual cash obligations $ 695,147 $ 1,128,356 $ 1,134,254 $ 2,157,766 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We had $138.5 million of purchase obligations related to future capital expenditures at December 31, 2005. Commitments for coal reserve related capital expenditures, including Federal Coal Leases, are included in Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations in the table above. Total capital expenditures for 2006 are expected to range from $450 million to $525 million, excluding Federal Coal Lease payments. Approximately 60% of projected 2006 capital expenditures relates to replacement, improvement, or expansion of existing mines, particularly in Appalachia and the Midwest. The remainder of the expenditures relate to growth initiatives such as increasing capacity in the Powder 66 Table of Contents River Basin. We anticipate funding these capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. In addition, cash requirements to fund employee related and reclamation liabilities included above are expected to be funded from operating cash flow, along with obligations related to long term debt, capital and operating leases and coal reserves. We believe the risk of generating lower than anticipated operating cash flow in 2006 is reduced by our high level of sales commitments, improved pricing and ongoing efforts to improve our operating cost structure. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions): Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total Self Bonding $ 671.8 $ $ $ $ 2.9 $ 674.7 Surety Bonds 335.6 258.8 19.2 28.4 642.0 Letters of Credit 0.1 22.7 144.6 120.1 119.7 407.2 $ 1,007.5 $ 281.5 $ 163.8 $ 120.1 $ 151.0 $ 1,723.9 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and collateral for surety companies. We have guaranteed $9.8 million of debt of an affiliate in which we have a 49% equity investment. We have also provided guarantees to small coal mining companies in order to facilitate their efforts to obtain bonding or financing. These guarantees arose as part of exclusive sales representation agreements with the small coal mining companies and totaled $5.5 million as of December 31, 2005. See Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of guarantees and indemnifications. In March 2000, we established an accounts receivable securitization program. Under the program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables that have been contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We used proceeds from the sale of the accounts receivable to repay long term debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The securitization program is scheduled to expire in September 2009, and the maximum amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable that may be sold to the Conduit is $225.0 million. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheet. The funding cost of the securitization program was $2.5 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In the third quarter of 2005, we renegotiated certain terms of the program, including lowering the program pricing, removing a minimum balance requirement and adding the ability to issue letters of credit under the program. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $225.0 million and $200.0 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A detailed description of our $225.0 million accounts receivable securitization is included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. 67 Table of Contents The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 900,000 $ 900,000 Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented In March 2005, the EITF issued EITF Issue No. 04 6, Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry, which states that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. Advance stripping costs include those costs necessary to remove overburden above an unmined coal seam as part of the surface mining process, and are included as the work in process component of Inventories in the consolidated balance sheets ($245.5 million and $197.2 million as of December 31, 2005, and December 31, 2004, respectively see Note 10). This is consistent with the concepts embodied in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins, which provides that the term inventory embraces goods awaiting sale. . ., goods in the course of production (work in process), and goods to be consumed directly or indirectly in production. . . . At the June 15 16, 2005 EITF meeting, the Task Force clarified that the intended meaning of inventory produced is inventory extracted. Based on this clarification, stripping costs incurred during a period will be attributed only to the inventory costs of the coal that is extracted during that same period. Due to physical loadout constraints and potential combustion issues, coal in most of our operations is not removed from the open pit until it is ready to ship; therefore, we will have little inventory on our balance sheet after implementing this interpretation. We expect this accounting treatment will introduce volatility in our earnings as costs associated with preparing coal for sale may be expensed before the coal is sold, and likewise, sales may be made with little to no cost matched to the sale. EITF Issue No. 04 6 is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 (January 1, 2006 for us). At the June 2005 EITF meeting, the Task Force modified the transition provisions of EITF Issue No. 04 6, indicating that companies that adopt in periods beginning after June 29, 2005 may utilize a cumulative effect adjustment approach where the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded directly to retained earnings in the year of adoption. If we had implemented the cumulative effect adjustment approach at December 31, 2005, the reduction to retained earnings, net of tax, would have been $150.6 million. We adopted EITF Issue No. 04 6 on January 1, 2006. On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 1239(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Income tax benefits from stock options exercised will be included in financing activities in the statement of cash flows rather than operating activities. In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission deferred the adoption date of SFAS No. 123(R) to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2006, and used the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. Based on stock 68 Table of Contents option grants made in 2005 (and years prior) and currently anticipated for 2006, we estimate we will recognize stock option expense for the year ending December 31, 2006, of $5.6 million, net of taxes. We began utilizing restricted stock as part of our equity based compensation strategy in January 2005. Based on the restricted stock grants made in 2005 and years prior, we recognized expense related to restricted stock of $1.0 million, net of taxes, in 2005. Accounting for restricted stock awards is not affected by the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal trading, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes, and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards at December 31, 2005, and included forwards and swaps at December 31, 2004. Our policy for accounting for coal trading activities is described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both option and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the actual low, high and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $1.2 million, $3.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. During the year ended 69 Table of Contents December 31, 2004, the actual low, high and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $0.5 million, $6.1 million and $2.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Percentage Year of Expiration of Portfolio 2006 76 % 2007 23 % 2008 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. In the event that we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2006 involves hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2005, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling A$915.8 million of which A$434.8 million, A$300.0 million and A$181.0 million will expire in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Our current expectation for 2006 non capital, Australian dollar denominated cash expenditures is approximately $633 million. A change in the Australian dollar/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of US$0.01 (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our Operating costs and expenses of $6.3 million per year. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $860.7 million of fixed rate borrowings and $544.8 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $5.4 million on our variable rate 70 Table of Contents borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $52.1 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2005 and 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had 15 to 25 million tons, 90 to 100 million tons and 155 to 165 million tons for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, of expected production (including steam and metallurgical coal production) available for sale or repricing at market prices. We have an annual metallurgical coal production capacity of 12 to 14 million tons. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. In addition, we utilize derivative contracts to hedge our commodity price exposure. As of December 31, 2005, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel. Notional amounts outstanding under these contracts, scheduled to expire through 2007, were 44.5 million gallons of heating oil and 24.4 million gallons of crude oil. Overall, we have fixed prices for approximately 50% of our anticipated diesel fuel requirements in 2006. We expect to consume 95 to 100 million gallons of fuel per year. On a per gallon basis, based on this usage, a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our operating costs of approximately $1 million per year. Alternatively, a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $2.3 million.
