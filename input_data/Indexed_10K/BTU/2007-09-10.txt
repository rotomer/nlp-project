Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 40 coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions and internationally in Australia and Venezuela. In 2006, we sold 247.6 million tons of coal, which was approximately 38% greater than the sales of our closest competitor. Our domestic sales represented 22% of all U.S. coal sales and was approximately 80% greater than the sales of our closest domestic competitor. Based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, demand for coal in the United States was approximately 1.1 billion tons in 2006. Domestic coal consumption is expected to grow at an average rate of 1.8% per year through 2030 when U.S. coal demand is forecasted to be 1.8 billion tons. The EIA expects demand for coal use at coal to liquids (CTL) plants to grow to 112 million tons by 2030. Coal fueled generation is used in most cases to meet baseload electricity requirements, and coal use generally grows at the approximate rate of electricity growth, which is expected to average 1.5% annually through 2030. Coal production located west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth as Western production increases to an estimated 68% share of total production in 2030. In 2005, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 50%, a share that the EIA projects will grow to 57% by 2030. Our primary customers are U.S. utilities, which accounted for 87% of our sales in 2006. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2006, approximately 90% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2006, production totaled 226.2 million tons and sales totaled 247.6 million tons. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Eastern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations, and our Eastern U.S. Mining operations 21 Table of Contents consist of our Appalachia and Midwest operations. The principal business of the Western U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. The principal business of the Eastern U.S. Mining segment is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities, as well as the mining of metallurgical coal, sold to steel and coke producers. Geologically, Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits and Eastern operations mine bituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as steam coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a small portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. In the second half of 2006, through two separate transactions, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel), an independent coal company in Australia for a total acquisition price of US$1.51 billion, net of cash received, plus approximately US$293.0 million in assumed debt. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for information on the financing of the Excel transaction. Assets acquired include three operating mines and three development stage mines, along with more than 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 6 to 8 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. During 2006, the Paso Diablo Mine contributed $28.0 million to segment Adjusted EBITDA in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and paid a dividend of $18.2 million. At December 31, 2006, our investment in Paso Diablo was $60.1 million. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from four of our Australian mines (two of which were acquired in the Excel transaction) and two of our U.S. mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 5% of our total sales volume and approximately 3% of U.S. sales volume. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 87% of revenues in 2006, our trading and brokerage operations (13% of revenues), transactions utilizing our vast natural resource position (selling non core land holdings and mineral interests) and other ventures generate revenues and additional cash flows. We continue to pursue the development of coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. The projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. The projects we are currently pursuing include the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in Washington County, Illinois and the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The plants, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. In October 2006, we entered an agreement with CMS Enterprises to share equally an expected 30% equity interest in the Prairie State Energy Campus and to oversee development and operation of the generating plant and coal mine. In the third quarter of 2006, the Prairie State Energy Campus received affirmation of the air quality permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and in the fourth quarter of 2006, parties that had previously challenged the permit filed a new appeal. The EIA projects that the high price of oil will lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including Btu conversion technologies, and that coal will increase its share as a fuel for generation of electricity. We are exploring several Btu conversion projects, which are designed to 22 Table of Contents expand the uses of coal through various technologies, and we are continuing to explore options particularly as they relate to Btu conversion technologies such as coal to liquids and coal gasification. Effective February 22, 2006, we implemented a two for one stock split on all shares of our common stock. All share and per share amounts in this annual report reflect this split. In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares for $99.8 million under this repurchase program. Results of Operations Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management primarily as a measure of our segments operating performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Summary Higher average sales prices and increased volumes in the Eastern U.S., Powder River Basin and Australian mining operations, including the October 2006 acquisition of three mines in Australia, contributed to a 13.2% increase in revenues to $5.26 billion compared to 2005. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.8% to $1.23 billion primarily on growth in international volumes and higher sales prices from our Australian mining operations and increased results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by operational challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from rail performance in the Powder River Basin and port congestion in Australia; geologic, equipment and third party supply issues as well as mine closures in our Western U.S. mining operations in late 2005. Net income was $600.7 million in 2006, or $2.23 per diluted share, an increase of 42.1% over 2005 net income of $422.7 million, or $1.58 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended Increase December 31, (Decrease) 2006 2005 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 160.5 154.3 6.2 4.0 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 54.7 52.5 2.2 4.2 % Australian Mining Operations 11.0 8.3 2.7 32.5 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 21.4 24.8 (3.4 ) (13.7 )% Total tons sold 247.6 239.9 7.7 3.2 % 23 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Increase to Year Ended December 31, Revenues 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 5,144,925 $ 4,545,323 $ 599,602 13.2 % Other revenues 111,390 99,130 12,260 12.4 % Total revenues $ 5,256,315 $ 4,644,453 $ 611,862 13.2 % In 2006, our total revenues were $5.26 billion, an increase of $611.9 million, or 13.2%, compared to prior year, which resulted from sales price increases in all regions, particularly in our Eastern and Australian operations and demand driven sales volume increases in the Powder River Basin, Midwest and Australian operations. Volumes related to the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 2.1 million tons of the increase to tons sold and approximately 43% of the increase to sales in Australia. Partially offsetting sales price increases were lower regional sales due to late 2005 mine closures in the Western U.S. Mining operations and lower brokerage volumes. Sales increased $599.6 million, or 13.2%, to $5.14 billion in 2006, which included increases of $91.9 million in Western U.S. Mining sales, $318.1 million in Eastern U.S. Mining sales and $245.1 million in Australian Mining sales, partially offset by a decrease of $55.5 million in our brokerage operations. Overall, prices and volumes in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased, mainly reflecting increases to sales prices of over $0.70 per ton and volumes of 12.7 million tons in the Powder River Basin. These increases at our Powder River Basin operations resulted from strong demand for the mines low sulfur products and improved rail conditions compared to 2005, when the region was dealing with major railroad maintenance. Despite rail performance improvements relative to 2005, constrained rail capacity continued to limit growth in the region in 2006. Offsetting this increase was lower production due to the cessation of mining operations at our Seneca and Black Mesa mines in late 2005 and unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues at our Twentymile Mine. On average, per ton sales prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased, driven by increases in metallurgical and steam coal prices. Sales volumes increased due to a newly developed mine, which began operation in late 2005, and the expansion of several existing mines, partially offset by lower production at one of our mines and at contract miner operations, as both managed geologic, equipment and, in certain locations, supplier issues. Sales from our Australian Mining operations were $245.1 million, or 41.0%, higher than in 2005, primarily due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, higher production at our underground mine following installation of a new longwall in the second quarter of 2006 and additional volumes from our newly acquired mines ($105.1 million). A higher per ton sales price reflected higher contract prices in 2006 for metallurgical coal as well as the slower realization of metallurgical coal price increases in 2005 when we operated under some lower priced carry over contracts from 2004 through most of the first nine months of 2005. Brokerage operations sales decreased $55.5 million in 2006 compared to prior year due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher sales prices. Other revenues increased $12.3 million, or 12.4%, compared to prior year. The increase includes proceeds of $28.2 million from settlement of commitments by a third party coal producer following a brokerage contract restructuring. Offsetting this increase were lower revenues related to synthetic fuel facilities as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants due to high crude oil prices. 24 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $1.23 billion for the year ended 2006, compared with $1.08 billion in the prior year. Details were as follows: Increase to Segment Year Ended December 31, Adjusted EBITDA 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 473,074 $ 459,039 $ 14,035 3.1 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 384,107 374,628 9,479 2.5 % Australian Mining Operations 278,411 202,582 75,829 37.4 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 92,604 43,058 49,546 115.1 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,228,196 $ 1,079,307 $ 148,889 13.8 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $14.0 million, or 3.1%, during 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in sales volumes of 12.7 million tons at our Powder River Basin operations, which resulted from continued strong demand and improved rail performance relative to 2005. Western U.S. Mining operations sales price per ton increased moderately due to mix changes resulting from ceasing operations at our Black Mesa and Seneca mines. Western U.S. Mining operations cost increases were driven by higher fuel costs, an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes, and the timing of major repairs. In addition, we experienced unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues related to the new longwall system at our Twentymile Mine; however, a recovery of certain costs associated with the equipment difficulties lessened the impact of these issues on our 2006 results. The Western U.S. Mining operations were also negatively impacted by the cessation of operations at the Black Mesa mine in late 2005. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $9.5 million, or 2.5%, compared to prior year primarily due to higher sales volumes partially offset by a decrease in margin per ton. Results improved compared to prior year as benefits of higher volumes, product mix and sales prices were partially offset by higher costs. The Eastern U.S. Mining operations experienced higher costs per ton due to fuel costs, revenue based royalties and production taxes as well as higher costs associated with equipment, geologic and contract miner issues. The 2006 results were also negatively impacted by lower revenues from synthetic fuel facilities of $10.1 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants. Also impacting Eastern U.S. Mining results was $8.9 million of income from a settlement related to customer billings regarding coal quality. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $75.8 million, or 37.4%, compared to prior year primarily due to increased sales volumes following increased production from the second quarter installation of a new longwall system at our underground mine, higher metallurgical coal sales prices, and a $19.7 million contribution from our newly acquired mines. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $49.5 million from the prior year, as 2006 results included proceeds from restructuring the brokerage contract mentioned above, improved brokerage margins and contribution from the newly established international operation, partially offset by lower domestic trading results. 25 Table of Contents Income Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,228,196 $ 1,079,307 $ 148,889 13.8 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (147,792 ) (208,909 ) 61,117 29.3 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (377,210 ) (316,114 ) (61,096 ) (19.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (40,112 ) (35,901 ) (4,211 ) (11.7 )% Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (144,846 ) (102,939 ) (41,907 ) (40.7 )% Interest income 12,726 10,641 2,085 19.6 % Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 530,962 $ 426,085 $ 104,877 24.6 % Income before income taxes and minority interests of $531.0 million for 2006 is $104.9 million, or 24.6%, higher than 2005 primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, Btu conversion and resource management. The $61.1 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2006 compared to 2005 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $30.7 million. The 2006 activity included sales with a combined gain of $66.3 million from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky and West Virginia, a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $26.7 million. In comparison, activity in 2005 included a $37.4 million gain on exchange of coal reserves as part of a dispute settlement with a third party supplier, a $31.1 million gain from sale of our remaining 0.838 million units of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P., a $12.5 million gain from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and properties, a $6.2 million gain on an asset exchange from which we received Illinois Basin coal and other gains on asset disposals of $14.3 million; Lower selling and administrative expenses of $13.9 million primarily associated with lower performance based incentive costs, partially offset by increases to share based compensation expense as a result of the new requirement to expense stock options, costs to support corporate and international growth initiatives and costs for the development and installation of a new enterprise resource planning system. The lower costs associated with the performance based incentive plan related to a long term, executive incentive plan that is driven by shareholder return and reflected lower stock price appreciation in 2006 than in the prior year; Higher equity income of $8.0 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela; and Lower net expenses of $4.7 million related to the development of the Prairie State Energy Campus due to a higher rate of cost reimbursement from the partners in 2006. 26 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $61.1 million in 2006 due to higher production volume, acquisitions and the impact of escalating costs and new capital, including two new longwall installations and new mine development. Also, 2005 depreciation, depletion and amortization was net of amortization of acquired contract liabilities. Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs increased $41.9 million primarily due to approximately $1.7 billion in new debt issuances in the second half of 2006 to finance the Excel acquisition. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more details of the debt issued. Net Income The following table presents net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 530,962 $ 426,085 $ 104,877 24.6 % Income tax benefit (provision) 81,515 (960 ) 82,475 n/a Minority interests (11,780 ) (2,472 ) (9,308 ) (376.5 )% Net income $ 600,697 $ 422,653 $ 178,044 42.1 % Net income increased $178.0 million in 2006 compared to prior year due to the increase in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and an income tax benefit compared to an income tax provision in 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended 2006 related primarily to a reduction in tax reserves no longer required due to the finalization of various federal and state returns and expiration of applicable statute of limitations, and a reduction in a portion of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards. The reduction to the valuation allowance resulted from an increase to estimated future taxable income primarily resulting from long term contracts signed in late 2006 which increased our ability to realize these benefits in the future. Minority interests increased primarily as a result of acquiring an additional interest in a joint venture near the end of the first quarter of 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Summary Our 2005 revenues of $4.64 billion increased 27.9% over the prior year. Revenues were driven higher by improved pricing in all of our mining operations and increased sales volume with 239.9 million tons sold compared to 227.2 million tons in 2004. Segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion was a 39.5% increase over the prior year due to increases in sales volumes and prices at our U.S. and Australian Mining Operations. Results in our Western U.S. Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado. Results in our Australian Mining Operations segment include amounts for our April 15, 2004, acquisition of the Burton and North Goonyella Mines as well as the opening of the Eaglefield Mine adjacent to the North Goonyella Mine in the fourth quarter of 2004. Our Corporate and Other segment includes results from our December 2004 acquisition of a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. In addition, higher gains on property transactions contributed to higher year over year results. Net income was $422.7 million in 2005, or $1.58 per diluted share, an increase of 141.0% over 2004 net income of $175.4 million, or $0.69 per diluted share. 27 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended Increase December 31, (Decrease) 2005 2004 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 154.3 142.2 12.1 8.5 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 52.5 51.7 0.8 1.5 % Australian Mining Operations 8.3 6.1 2.2 36.1 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 24.8 27.2 (2.4 ) (8.8 )% Total tons sold 239.9 227.2 12.7 5.6 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: Year Ended December 31, Increase to Revenues 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Sales $ 4,545,323 $ 3,545,027 $ 1,000,296 28.2 % Other revenues 99,130 86,555 12,575 14.5 % Total revenues $ 4,644,453 $ 3,631,582 $ 1,012,871 27.9 % Our revenues increased by $1.01 billion, or 27.9%, to $4.64 billion compared to prior year. The three mines we acquired in the second quarter of 2004 contributed $365.2 million of revenue growth due to the additional 105 days of operations in 2005 compared to the prior year. The remaining $647.7 million of revenue growth was driven by higher sales prices and volumes across all mining segments and improved volumes in our brokerage operations. Sales increased 28.2% to $4.55 billion in 2005, reflecting increases in every operating segment. Western U.S. Mining sales increased $222.2 million, Eastern U.S. Mining sales were $224.0 million higher, sales in Australia Mining improved $328.0 million and sales from our brokerage operations increased $226.0 million. Sales in every segment increased on improved pricing, and volumes were higher in every segment other than Trading and Brokerage. Our average sales price per ton increased 17.4% during 2005 due to increased demand for all of our coal products, which drove pricing higher, particularly in the regions where we produce metallurgical coal. Prices for metallurgical coal and our ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal have been the subject of increasing demand. We sell metallurgical coal from our Eastern U.S. and Australian Mining operations. We sell ultra low sulfur Powder River Basin coal from our Western U.S. Mining operations. The sales mix also improved due to an increase in sales from our Australian Mining segment, where per ton prices are higher than in domestic markets due primarily to a higher proportion of metallurgical coal production in the Australian segment sales mix. The increase in Eastern U.S. Mining operations sales was primarily due to improved pricing for both steam and metallurgical coal from the region. On average, prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased 14.1% to $33.10 per ton. Sales increased in our Western U.S. Mining operations due to higher demand driven volumes and prices, particularly in the Powder River Basin. Overall, prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased 6.6% to $10.45 per ton. Powder River Basin production and sales volumes were up as a result of increasingly strong demand for the mines low sulfur product, which continues to expand its market area geographically. Powder River Basin operations were able to ship record volumes during 2005 by overcoming train derailments, weather and track maintenance disruptions on the main shipping line out of the basin. Our Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, contributed to higher sales in 2005 due to an additional four months of ownership, higher prices and increased mine 28 Table of Contents productivity. Sales from our Australian Mining operations were $328.0 million, or 122.1%, higher than in 2004. The increase in Australian sales was due primarily to a 63.3% increase in per ton sales prices largely due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, an increase in volumes which included the opening of our Eaglefield surface mine at the end of 2004, and $197.6 million of incremental sales from the two mines we acquired in April 2004 due to 105 additional days of operations in 2005 compared to 2004. Our Trading and Brokerage operations sales increased $226.0 million in 2005 compared to prior year due to an increase in average per ton prices and higher eastern U.S. and international brokerage volumes. Other revenues increased $12.6 million, or 14.5%, compared to prior year primarily due to proceeds from a purchase contract restructuring and higher synthetic fuel revenues in the Midwest. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion for 2005 was $305.5 million higher than 2004 segment Adjusted EBITDA of $773.8 million, and was composed of the following: Increase to Segment Year Ended December 31, Adjusted EBITDA 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 459,039 $ 402,052 $ 56,987 14.2 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 374,628 280,357 94,271 33.6 % Australian Mining Operations 202,582 50,372 152,210 302.2 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 43,058 41,039 2,019 4.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $57.0 million during 2005 due to a margin per ton increase of $0.15, or 5.3%, and a sales volume increase of 12.1 million tons. Results in the Powder River Basin operations contributed to the increase in Western U.S. Mining operations as it earned 12.3% higher per ton margins while increasing volumes 8.5% in response to greater demand for our low sulfur products. Improved revenues overcame increased unit costs that resulted from higher fuel and explosives costs, lower than anticipated volume due to rail difficulties and an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes. The Twentymile Mine, acquired in April of 2004, contributed $25.4 million more to Adjusted EBITDA in 2005 than in 2004, due to four months of incremental ownership and a 22.2% increase in per ton margin. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $94.3 million, or 33.6%, compared to prior year primarily due to an increase in margin per ton of $1.71, or 31.5%. Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of sales price increases, partially offset by lower production at two of our mines and higher costs related to geologic issues, contract mining, fuel, repair and maintenance and the impact of heavy rainfall on surface operations early in the year. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $152.2 million in the current year, a 302.2% increase compared to prior year due to an increase of $16.23, or 197.4%, in margin per ton and 2.2 million additional tons shipped. Our Australian operations produce mostly (75% to 85%) high margin metallurgical coal. The two mines we acquired in April 2004 added $87.4 million to Adjusted EBITDA compared to eight months of ownership in 2004. The remaining increase of $64.8 million was primarily due to an increase in volume, including tonnage from our surface operation opened at the end of the prior year, and an increase of 63.3% in average per ton sale price. While current year margins benefited from strong sales prices, margin growth was limited by the impact of port congestion, related demurrage costs and higher costs due to geological problems at the underground mine. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.0 million from the prior year primarily due to higher brokerage results. Results in 2005 included a net charge of $4.0 million, primarily related to the breach of a coal supply contract by a producer. 29 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Income Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,079,307 $ 773,820 $ 305,487 39.5 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (208,909 ) (214,576 ) 5,667 2.6 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (316,114 ) (270,159 ) (45,955 ) (17.0 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (35,901 ) (42,387 ) 6,486 15.3 % Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (102,939 ) (98,544 ) (4,395 ) (4.5 )% Interest income 10,641 4,917 5,724 116.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4 % Income before income taxes and minority interest of $426.1 million for the current year is $273.0 million, or 178.4%, higher than prior year primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Increases in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense offset improvements in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, asset retirement obligation expense, debt extinguishment costs and interest income. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our Venezuelan joint venture, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development and resource management. The $5.7 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2005 compared to 2004 included: net gains on asset sales that were $77.7 million higher than prior year primarily due to a $37.4 million gain from a property exchange related to settlement of a contract dispute with a third party coal supplier (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements), sales of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P. (PVR) units ($31.1 million) (see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements), resource sales involving non strategic coal assets and properties ($12.5 million), and an asset exchange in which we acquired Illinois Basin coal reserves ($6.2 million). The gain from PVR unit sales in 2005 was from the sale of all of our remaining 0.838 million units compared to a gain of $15.8 million on the sale of 0.775 million units in two separate transactions during 2004. All other gains on asset disposals in 2005 and 2004 were $14.3 million and $8.0 million, respectively; higher equity income of $18.7 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (acquired in December 2004), which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela, and; lower net expenses related to generation development of $5.1 million, primarily due to reimbursements from the Prairie State Energy Campus partnership group. These improvements were partially offset by: a $36.0 million increase in past mining obligations expense, primarily related to higher retiree health care costs. The increase in retiree health care costs was actuarially driven by higher trend rates, and lower interest discount assumptions and higher amortization of actuarial losses in 2005, and; an increase of $46.8 million in selling and administrative expenses primarily related to accruals for higher short term and long term performance based incentive plans ($32.2 million). These incentives are principally long term plans that are driven by total shareholder returns. Our share price increased 104% during 2005, significantly outperforming industrial benchmarks and our coal 30 Table of Contents peer group average. The remaining increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to higher personnel and outside services costs needed to advance our growth initiatives in areas such as China and BTU conversion, acquisitions and regulatory costs (e.g. Sarbanes Oxley), and an increase in advertising costs related to an industry awareness campaign launched in late 2005. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $46.0 million during 2005. Approximately 56% of the increase was due to acquisitions completed during 2004 and the remainder was from increased volumes at existing mines and operations opened during 2005. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased $6.5 million in 2005 due to additional expenses incurred in 2004 to accelerate the planned reclamation of certain closed mine sites. Interest expense increased $6.1 million primarily related to a full year of interest in 2005 on $250 million of 5.875% Senior Notes issued in late March of 2004 and increases in the cost of floating rate debt due to higher interest rates. Interest income improved $5.7 million due to higher yields on short term interest rates and an increase in invested balances due to improved cash flows during 2005. Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2005 2004 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 426,085 $ 153,071 $ 273,014 178.4% Income tax benefit (provision) (960 ) 26,437 (27,397 ) (103.6 )% Minority interests (2,472 ) (1,282 ) (1,190 ) (92.8 )% Income from continuing operations 422,653 178,226 244,427 (137.1 )% Loss from discontinued operations (2,839 ) 2,839 n/a Net income $ 422,653 $ 175,387 $ 247,266 141.0% Net income increased $247.3 million, or 141.0%, compared to the prior year due to the increase in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above, partially offset by increases in our income tax provision. The income tax benefit in 2004 included a $25.9 million reduction in the valuation allowance on net operating loss carry forwards and alternative minimum tax credits. The income tax provision in 2005 was higher based on the increase in pretax income which was partially offset by the higher permanent benefit of percentage depletion and the partial benefit of tax loss from a deemed liquidation of a subsidiary arising as an indirect consequence of a comprehensive and strategic internal restructuring we completed during 2005. This restructuring resulted from efforts to better align corporate ownership of subsidiaries on a geographic and functional basis. Outlook Events Impacting Near Term Operations In October 2006, we acquired Excel Coal Limited, which included three operating mines, two late development stage mines and a development stage mine. These development stage mines are expected to begin shipments in 2007, and our 2007 results will be impacted to the extent we complete ramp up activities at these development stage mines on time and at expected capacity. Furthermore, our two primary Australian shipping points, Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and Port of Newcastle, are experiencing significant queues of vessels, which could result in delayed shipments and demurrage charges. Currently depressed Central Appalachian coal prices combined with escalating costs of our third party contractors could adversely impact our saleable production as it becomes uneconomic to mine. Although we expect that the Twentymile longwall system will allow for expanded capacity over the next several years, we continue to manage equipment and lower coal quality issues at our Twentymile mine. 31 Table of Contents Shipments from our Powder River Basin mines improved in 2006, but were still impacted by rail service disruptions. Rail carriers are expected to continue improvements in 2007. Although we currently expect to increase our shipment levels from our Powder River Basin operations in 2007 compared with 2006, our ability to reach these targeted shipment levels is dependent upon the performance of the rail carriers. Our union workforce east of the Mississippi River is primarily represented by the UMWA. The UMWA represented workers at one of our eastern mines operate under a contract that expires on December 31, 2007. The remainder of our UMWA represented workers in the east operate under a recently signed, five year labor agreement expiring December 31, 2011. The new contract mirrors the 2007 National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement and stipulates a $1.50 per hour increase to wages effective January 1, 2007 and a total wage increase of $4.00 per hour over the life of the agreement. The contract also calls for a $1,000 bonus for each of our UMWA represented employees. Long Term Outlook Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as growth continues in the U.S., Asia and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. Approximately 115 gigawatts of new coal fueled electricity generating capacity is scheduled to come on line around the world over the next three years, and the EIA projects an additional 156 gigawatts of new U.S. coal fueled generation by 2030, which by itself represents more than 500 million tons of additional coal demand. Global coal markets continued to grow, driven by increased demand from growing economies. The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5% based on fourth quarter 2006 data as reported by the U.S. Commerce Department, while Chinas economy grew 10.7% in 2006 as published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Metallurgical coal continued to sell at a significant premium to steam coal. Metallurgical markets, while off record levels, remain strong as seaborne metallurgical coal prices for the upcoming fiscal year were settling from a reference price near $100 per metric ton and as China steel production shows signs of continued growth over 2005 levels. We expect to capitalize on the strong global market for metallurgical coal primarily through production and sales of metallurgical coal from our Appalachia and Australian operations. In response to growing international markets, we established an international trading group in 2006, and added another operations office in Europe in early 2007. Coal to gas and coal to liquids (CTL) plants represent a significant avenue for long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including coal to liquids, and in the U.S. coal to liquid technologies are receiving growing bipartisan support as demonstrated by the newly introduced CTL bills such as the Coal to Liquid Fuel Promotion Act within the Senate. China and India are developing coal to gas and coal to liquids facilities. Demand for Powder River Basin coal remains strong, particularly for our ultra low sulfur products. The Powder River Basin represents more than half of our production. We control approximately 3.5 billion tons of proven and probable reserves in the Southern Powder River Basin, and we sold 138.4 million tons of coal from this region during 2006, an increase of 10.1% over the prior year. We are targeting 2007 production of 240 to 260 million tons and total sales volume of 265 to 285 tons, including 15 to 18 million tons of metallurgical coal. As of December 31, 2006, our unpriced 2007 volumes for planned produced tonnage were 5 to 15 million U.S. tons and 14 million Australia tons. Our total unpriced planned production for 2008 is approximately 70 to 80 million tons in the United States and 20 to 22 million tons in Australia. Management plans to aggressively control costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs, including a company wide initiative to instill best 32 Table of Contents practices at all operations. In addition, historically low long term interest rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities We have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs, workers compensation obligations and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14, 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006 resulted in each of these liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 being equal to the funded status of the plans. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2006, for these liabilities totaled $178.7 million, while payments were $146.2 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. 33 Table of Contents Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 9,501 $ (7,989 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 179,264 $ (150,765 ) Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 1,064 $ (1,496 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (78,243 ) $ 82,702 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.47 years at December 31, 2006. Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $40.1 million, and payments totaled $36.6 million. See detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including 34 Table of Contents related interest. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Additional details regarding the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in Note 11. Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (January 1, 2007 for the Company). Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 98% of our revenue in 2006 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of coal supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal in over the counter markets. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal and emission allowance positions. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. All of the contracts in our trading portfolio as of December 31, 2006 were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials. As of December 31, 2006, 41% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2007 and 80% within 24 months. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Exploration and Drilling Costs Exploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Advance Stripping Costs Pre production: At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre production box cut to remove overburden (i.e., advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (i.e., advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices. Post production: Advance stripping costs related to post production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, we expense such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment. Since the January 1, 2006 adoption of EITF 04 6, we have not incurred development costs (advance stripping costs) related to opening new pits at existing surface operations. However, we anticipate such development expenditures will be incurred in the latter part of 2007 and beyond. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable (through our securitization program). Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as planned acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends, 35 Table of Contents among other things, are subject to limitations imposed by our Senior Notes and Debenture covenants. We expect to fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $595.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, a decrease of $107.1 million compared to $702.8 million provided by operating activities in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to the timing of working capital needs. The decrease in cash from operating activities would have been $30.4 million lower had 2006 and 2005 operating cash flows been shown on a comparable basis. The 2006 operating cash flows include a required reclassification of the excess tax benefit related to stock option exercises ($33.2 million) from operating to financing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $584.2 million used in the prior year. The increase reflects the acquisition of Excel for $1.51 billion, net of cash acquired, higher capital expenditures of $93.4 million, higher federal coal lease expenditures of $59.8 million, the acquisition of an additional interest in a joint venture for $44.5 million, and the receipt of notes in lieu of payments on asset sales of $45.6 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from asset disposals of $46.9 million in 2006 and the purchase of mining and related assets of $141.2 million in 2005. Capital expenditures included longwall equipment and mine development at our Australian mines (including our recently acquired Excel operations), the opening of new mines and the purchase of equipment for expansion. The $141.2 million purchase of mining and related assets in 2005 included 70 million tons of Illinois and Indiana coal reserves, surface properties and equipment from Lexington Coal Company ($56.5 million) and rail, loadout and surface facilities as well as other mining assets for $84.7 million from another major coal producer. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.37 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to a use of $4.9 million in 2005. In 2006, we issued net borrowings of $1.74 billion, which were utilized to fund the $1.51 billion Excel acquisition, the repayment of Excels bank facility and a portion of its outstanding bonds, and other corporate purposes. See the detailed discussion of our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures, Senior Notes offerings and borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility below. In addition to the net issuance of debt related to the Excel acquisition, we repaid $23.8 million of debt held by a majority owned joint venture, purchased $7.7 million of our 5.875% Senior Notes in the open market, and made scheduled debt repayments of $11.1 million on our 5% Subordinated Note and other notes payable. The 2006 activity compared to 2005 also reflected payments for common stock repurchases of $99.8 million, debt issuance costs of $40.6 million and higher dividends of $18.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares at a cost of $99.8 million under our share repurchase program as authorized by the Board of Directors. The 2006 activity included a decrease in the usage of our accounts receivable securitization program of $5.8 million compared to an increase of $25.0 million in 2005. The 2006 activity compared to 2005 also reflected $7.0 million lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options as well as a $33.2 million tax benefit related to stock option exercises included in financing activity based on the newly adopted accounting standard for share based compensation (see Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements below for more discussion about the adoption of this standard). In 2005, the tax benefit related to stock option exercises (totaling $30.4 million) was included in operating activities. 36 Table of Contents Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 consisted of the following: December 31, 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 547,000 $ Term Loan under Senior Secured Credit Facility 442,500 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 732,500 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 650,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 246,897 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 231,845 239,525 5.0% Subordinated Note 59,504 66,693 6.84% Series C Bonds due 2016 43,000 6.34% Series B Bonds due 2014 21,000 6.84% Series A Bonds due 2014 10,000 Capital lease obligations 56,707 1,529 Fair value of interest rate swaps (13,784 ) (8,879 ) Other 29,157 14,138 Total $ 3,263,826 $ 1,405,506 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2006, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a $2.75 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and which amended and restated in full our then existing $1.35 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility replaced our previous $900.0 million revolving credit facility and the increased capacity is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. In September 2006, we borrowed $312.0 million under the Revolver in conjunction with the Excel acquisition and repaid this $312.0 million outstanding balance in December 2006 with net proceeds from the Debentures. The Term Loan Facility consisted of an unsecured $440.0 million portion, which was drawn at closing to replace the previous term loan ($437.5 million balance at time of replacement; $442.5 million at December 31, 2005) issued under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Term Loan Facility also included a Delayed Draw Term Loan Sub Facility of up to $510.0 million, which was fully drawn in October 2006 in connection with the Excel acquisition. In December 2006, $403.0 million of the outstanding balance of the Term Loan Facility ($950.0 million was outstanding at time of repayment) was repaid with the net proceeds from the Debentures. In conjunction with the establishment of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we incurred $8.6 million in financing costs, of which $5.6 million related to the Revolving Credit Facility and $3.0 million related to the Term Loan Facility. These debt issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over five years, the term of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 1.0% with step downs to LIBOR plus 0.50% based on improvement in the leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The rate applicable to the Term Loan Facility was 6.35% at December 31, 2006. 37 Table of Contents Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The new facility is less restrictive with respect to limitations on our dividend payments, capital expenditures, asset sales or stock repurchases. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2006, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our revolving line of credit was primarily used for standby letters of credit until September 2006, when we also used the revolving line of credit to facilitate the Excel acquisition. As discussed above, the $312.0 million outstanding under the revolving line of credit was repaid in December 2006 with net proceeds from the Debentures. The remaining available borrowing capacity ($1.29 billion as of December 31, 2006) will be used to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs, including standby letters of credit. During 2005, we had no borrowings outstanding under our previous $900.0 million revolving line of credit, which we used primarily for standby letters of credit. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes, and the Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures as of December 31, 2006. Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures On December 20, 2006, we issued $732.5 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (the Debentures), including $57.5 million issued pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $715.0 million and were used to repay indebtedness under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. The Debentures will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.75% per year. We may elect to, and if and to the extent that a mandatory trigger event (as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures) has occurred and is continuing will be required to, defer interest payments on the Debentures. After five years of deferral at our option, or upon the occurrence of a mandatory trigger event, we generally must sell warrants or preferred stock with specified characteristics and use the funds from that sale to pay deferred interest, subject to certain limitations. In no event may we defer payments of interest on the Debentures for more than ten years. The Debentures are convertible at any time on or prior to December 15, 2036 if any of the following conditions occur: (i) our closing common stock price exceeds 140% of the then applicable conversion price for the Debentures (currently $86.73 per share) for at least 20 of the final 30 trading days in any quarter; (ii) a notice of redemption is issued with respect to the Debentures; (iii) a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures; (iv) satisfaction of certain trading price conditions; and (v) other specified corporate transactions described in the indenture governing the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures are convertible at any time after December 15, 2036 to December 15, 2041, the scheduled maturity date. In the case of conversion following a notice of redemption or upon a non stock change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures, holders may convert their Debentures into cash in the amount of the principal amount of their Debentures and shares of our common stock for any conversion value in excess of the principal amount. In all other conversion circumstances, holders will receive perpetual preferred stock (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements) with a liquidation preference equal to the principal amount of their Debentures, and any conversion value in excess of the principal amount will be settled with our common stock. The consideration delivered upon conversion will be based upon an initial conversion rate of 16.1421 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures, subject to adjustment. This conversion rate represents an initial conversion price of approximately $61.95 per share, a 40% premium over the closing stock price of $44.25 on December 14, 2006, the date of the pricing of the offering of the Debentures. The Debentures are unsecured obligations, ranking junior to all existing and future senior and subordinated debt (excluding trade accounts payable or accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of 38 Table of Contents business) except for any future debt that ranks equal to or junior to the Debentures. The Debentures will rank equal in right of payment with our obligations to trade creditors. Substantially, all of our existing indebtedness is senior to the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness of our subsidiaries. The indenture governing the Debentures places no limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that we or any of our subsidiaries may incur (see Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Debentures). 7.375% Senior Notes Due November 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes Due November 2026 On October 12, 2006, we completed a $650 million offering of 7.375% 10 year Senior Notes due 2016 and $250 million of 7.875% 20 year Senior Notes due 2026. The notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness; equally in right of payment with any senior indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and effectively junior to all the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2007. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors, as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions. The notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make whole premium, if applicable, and any accrued unpaid interest to the redemption date. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, were $886.1 million. Series Bonds As of December 31, 2006, we had $74.0 million in Series Bonds outstanding, which were assumed as part of the Excel acquisition. The 6.84% Series A Bonds have a balloon maturity in December 2014. The 6.34% Series B Bonds mature in December 2014 and are payable in installments beginning December 2008. The 6.84% Series C Bonds mature in December 2016 and are payable in installments beginning December 2012. Interest payments occur in June and December of each year. Interest Rate Swaps Prior to completion of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we had two $400.0 million interest rate swaps. A $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap was designated as a hedge of changes in expected cash flows on the previous term loan under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Under this swap, we paid a fixed rate of 6.764% and received a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5% that reset each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate. A $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap was designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Under this swap, we paid a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.97% that reset each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 based upon the three month LIBOR rate and received a fixed rate of 6.875%. In conjunction with the completion of the new Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the $400.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap was terminated and resulted in payment to us of $5.2 million. We recorded the $5.2 million fair value of the swap in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet and will amortize this amount to interest expense over the remaining term of the forecasted interest payments initially hedged. We then entered into a $120.0 million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swap with a fixed rate of 6.25% and a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%. This interest rate swap was designated as a hedge of the variable interest payments on the Term Loan under the new Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. We also terminated $280.0 million of our $400.0 million notional amount fixed to floating interest rate swap designated as a hedge of the changes in fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Reducing the notional amount of the interest rate swap to $120.0 million resulted in payment of $5.2 million to the 39 Table of Contents counterparty. Reduction of the notional amount of the swap did not affect our floating and fixed rates. The $5.2 million of fair value associated with the termination of the $280.0 million portion of the swap was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of long term debt and will be amortized to interest expense through maturity of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. Because the critical terms of the swaps and the respective debt instruments they hedge coincide, there was no hedge ineffectiveness recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006 there was an unrealized loss related to the cash flow hedge of $2.5 million and at December 31, 2005 there was an unrealized gain related to the cash flow hedge of $2.3 million. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net unrealized loss on the fair value hedges discussed above were $13.8 million and $8.9 million, respectively, which is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying value of the Senior Notes (see table above). Third party Security Ratings In 2006, third party rating agencies performed a comprehensive review of our securities ratings based on our entrance into the new senior unsecured credit facility and the issuance of additional debt securities to facilitate the Excel acquisition. The ratings for our senior unsecured credit facility and our senior unsecured notes are as follows: Moodys issued a Ba1 rating, Standard & Poors issued a BB rating and Fitch issued a BB+ rating. The rating on our convertible junior subordinated debentures issued in December 2006 were as follows: Moodys issued a Ba2 rating, Standard & Poors issued a B rating and Fitch issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement On July 28, 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we can file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. The Debentures, 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Excel Transaction On July 5, 2006, we signed a merger implementation agreement to acquire Excel Coal Limited (Excel), an independent coal company, by means of a scheme of arrangement transaction under Australian law. The merger implementation agreement was amended on September 18, 2006, and we agreed to pay A$9.50 per share (US$7.16 as of the amendment date) for the outstanding shares of Excel. On September 20, 2006, as part of the amended agreement, we acquired 19.99% of the outstanding shares of Excel at A$9.50 per share, resulting in payment of A$408.3 million, or US$307.8 million. In October 2006, we acquired the remaining interest in Excel for A$9.50 per share (US$7.07 per share), a total of A$1.63 billion or US$1.21 billion. The total acquisition price, including the advance purchase of 19.99% and related costs, was US$1.54 billion in cash plus assumed debt of US$293.0 million, less US$30.0 million of cash acquired in the transaction, and was financed with borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and Senior Notes due 2016 and 2026 (see Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the financing of the Excel acquisition). The Excel acquisition includes three operating mines (Wambo Open Cut Mine, Metropolitan Mine and Chain Valley Mine) and three development stage mines (North Wambo Underground Mine, Wilpinjong Mine and Millennium Mine), with more than 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. We also acquired a 51.0% 40 Table of Contents interest in Excelven Pty Ltd., which owns Transportes Coal Sea de Venezuela C.A. and a 96.7% interest in Cosila Complejo Siderurgico Del Lago S.A., which owns the Las Carmelitas coal mine development project. The results of operations of Excel are included in our Australian Mining Operations segment from October 2006. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Excel acquisition). Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Payments Due By Year Within After 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 303,849 $ 481,974 $ 859,965 $ 4,323,807 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 11,335 21,806 15,686 23,428 Operating leases obligations 102,256 152,264 101,386 168,076 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 125,791 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 216,996 344,407 25,459 46,611 Other long term liabilities(2) 170,716 337,809 396,113 1,362,711 Total contractual cash obligations $ 930,943 $ 1,338,260 $ 1,398,609 $ 5,924,633 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2006, we had $125.8 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $479.8 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next three years. Total capital expenditures for 2007 are expected to range from $450 million to $525 million, excluding federal coal reserve lease payments, and relate to replacement, improvement, or expansion of existing mines, particularly in Australia, Appalachia and the Midwest, and growth initiatives such as increasing capacity in the Powder River Basin. Approximately $10 million of the expenditures relate to safety equipment that will be utilized to comply with recently issued federal and state regulations. Capital expenditures were funded primarily through operating cash flow. Despite the acquisition of three development stage mines in 2006, we will exercise capital discipline in 2007, limiting capital expenditures to 2006 levels. Our subsidiary, Peabody Pacific, has committed to pay up to a maximum of A$0.20/tonne (approximately US$0.15/tonne) of coal sales for a period of five years to the Australian COAL21 Fund. The COAL21 Fund is a voluntary coal industry fund to support clean coal technology demonstration projects and research in Australia. All major coal companies in Australia have committed to this fund. The commitment to pay starts on April 1, 2007 with a levy of A$0.10/tonne of coal sales. This levy is expected to rise to A$0.20/tonne on July 1, 2007. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such 41 Table of Contents as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2006: Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self Bonding $ 685.3 $ $ $ $ 2.9 $ 688.2 Surety Bonds 441.5 83.9 31.7 27.2 584.3 Letters of Credit 4.1 20.3 156.8 119.4 208.8 509.4 $ 1,130.9 $ 104.2 $ 188.5 $ 119.4 $ 238.9 $ 1,781.9 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and collateral for surety companies. As part of arrangements through which we obtain exclusive sales representation agreements with small coal mining companies (the Counterparties), we issued financial guarantees on behalf of the Counterparties. These guarantees facilitate the Counterparties efforts to obtain bonding or financing. In July 2006, we issued $5.2 million of financial guarantees, expiring at various dates through July 2013, on behalf of a small coal producer to facilitate its efforts in obtaining financing. In the event of default, we have multiple recourse options, including the ability to assume the loans and procure title and use of the equipment purchased through the loans. If default occurs, we have the ability and intent to exercise our recourse options, so the liability associated with the guarantee has been valued at zero. We have also guaranteed bonding for a partnership in which we formerly held an interest. The aggregate amount guaranteed for all such Counterparties was $12.1 million, and the fair value of the guarantees recognized as a liability was $0.4 million as of December 31, 2006. Our obligations under the guarantees extend to September 2015. In March 2006, we issued a guarantee for certain equipment lease arrangements on behalf of one of the sales representation parties with maximum potential future payments totaling $2.7 million at December 31, 2006, and with lease terms that extend to April 2010. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of our guarantees. Under our accounts receivable securitization program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $1.9 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The securitization program is scheduled to expire in September 2009. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $219.2 million and $225.0 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounts receivable securitization). 42 Table of Contents The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2006: Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Over Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Lines of credit and/ or standby letters of credit $ 1,800,000 $ $ $ 1,800,000 $ Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements We adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 6, Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry (EITF Issue No. 04 6) on January 1, 2006 and utilized the cumulative effect adjustment approach whereby a cumulative effect adjustment reduced retained earnings by $150.3 million, net of tax. EITF Issue No. 04 6 states that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred. Advance stripping costs include those costs necessary to remove overburden above an unmined coal seam as part of the surface mining process and prior to the adoption were included as the work in process component of Inventories in the consolidated balance sheet. EITF Issue No. 04 6 and its interpretations require stripping costs incurred during a period to be attributed only to the inventory costs of the coal that is extracted during that same period, and therefore, advance stripping costs are no longer separately classified as a component of inventory. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB Opinion No. 25) and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Prior to January 1, 2006, we applied APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans, as permitted under SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. We applied SFAS No. 123(R) through use of the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the grant date. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires that the excess income tax benefits from stock options exercised be recorded as financing cash inflow on the statements of cash flows. The excess income tax benefit from stock option exercises during 2005 and 2004 are included in operating cash flows, netted in deferred tax activity. For share based payment instruments excluding restricted stock, we recognized $17.7 million (or $0.07 per diluted share), $24.8 million (or $0.09 per diluted share) and $12.8 million (or $0.05 per diluted share) of expense, net of taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R), our net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $4.4 million (or $0.02 per diluted share) lower than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under APB Opinion No. 25. Share based compensation expense is recorded in Selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We used the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan share based payments made before and after the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). We began utilizing restricted stock as part of our equity based compensation strategy in January 2005. Accounting for restricted stock awards was not changed by the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). As of December 31, 2006, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards was $24.0 million, net of taxes, which is expected to be 43 Table of Contents recognized over 5.0 years with a weighted average period of 1.3 years. See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share based compensation plans. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158). For fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans (an asset for overfunded status or a liability for underfunded status) in a companys balance sheet. In addition, the standard requires recognition of actuarial gains and losses, prior service cost, and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS No. 106) when determining a plans funded status, with a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We adopted SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006, and as a result, recorded a noncurrent liability of $376.1 million, which reflected the total underfunded status of the pension, retiree healthcare and workers compensation plans. The funded status of each plan was measured as the difference between the fair value of the assets and the projected benefit obligation (the funded status). SFAS No. 158 did not impact net income. The impact to the balance sheet was as follows (see Notes 14, 15, and 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details): After Application Before Application of of SFAS No. 158 Adjustments SFAS No. 158 (Dollars in thousands) Workers compensation obligations $ 237,965 $ (4,558 ) $ 233,407 Accrued postretirement benefit costs 973,164 395,522 1,368,686 Other noncurrent liabilities (includes long term pension and UMWA Combined Fund liabilities) 375,485 (14,855 ) 360,630 Deferred income taxes (long term liability) 344,712 (149,499 ) 195,213 Total liabilities 6,915,583 226,610 7,142,193 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (22,448 ) (226,610 ) (249,058 ) Total stockholders equity 2,565,136 (226,610 ) 2,338,526 Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (January 1, 2007 for the Company). Any adjustments required upon the adoption of this interpretation must be recorded directly to retained earnings in the year of adoption and reported as a change in accounting principle. We expect the adoption of FIN No. 48 will not have a material impact on our financial position. 44 Table of Contents
