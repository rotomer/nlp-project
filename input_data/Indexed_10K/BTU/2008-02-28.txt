Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Share Repurchases Share Repurchase Program In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, approximately 13.1 million shares. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. As of December 31, 2007, there were approximately 10.9 million shares available for repurchase. There were no share repurchases under this program in the year ended December 31, 2007. Share Relinquishment During the year ended December 31, 2007, we received 137,625 shares of common stock as consideration for employees exercise of stock options and to pay estimated taxes at the vesting date of restricted stock. The value of the common stock tendered by employees to exercise stock options and to settle taxes on restricted stock was based upon the closing price on the dates of the respective transactions.

Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected financial and other data about us for the most recent five fiscal years. The following table and the discussion of our results of operations in 2007 and 2006 in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot Coal Corporation as discontinued operations. 48 In October 2006, we acquired Excel Coal Limited and our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the results of operations of the three operating mines and three development stage mines (all of which are operating as of December 31, 2007) in New South Wales, Australia and Queensland, Australia from the date of acquisition. On April 15, 2004, we acquired three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the results of operations of the two mines in Queensland, Australia and the results of operations of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado from the April 15, 2004 purchase date. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 included early debt extinguishment costs of $53.5 million pursuant to our debt refinancing in the first half of 2003. In addition, results included expense relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of Emerging Issues Task Force No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 from our audited financial statements. You should read the following table in conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 49 The results of operations for the historical periods included in the following table are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods. In addition, the Risk Factors section of Item 1A of this report includes a discussion of risk factors that could impact our future results of operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 31 coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions, except Appalachia, and international interests in Australia and Venezuela. In 2007, we sold 237.8 million tons of coal. Our U.S. sales represented 19% of all U.S. coal sales and were approximately 80% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. United States coal demand was approximately 1.1 billion tons in 2007, based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Coals predominate use is for baseload electricity requirements. For the 12 months ended November 2007, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 50%, a share that the EIA projects will grow to 55% by 2030. EIA projects an additional 130 gigawatts of new U.S. coal fueled generation by 2030, including 9 gigawatts at coal to liquids plants and 45 gigawatts at integrated gasification combined cycle plants, which represents more than 500 million tons of additional coal demand. Domestic coal consumption is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.8% from 2007 through 2030 when U.S. coal demand is forecasted to reach 1.7 billion tons. Coal production located west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth as Western production increases to an estimated 65% share of total production in 2030 versus 58% in 2007. Globally, we believe that coal demand is driven by electricity generation (65%) and industrial use (31%), including steel making. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates coals share of total world energy consumption is projected to increase from 25% in 2005 to 28% through 2030, and in the electric power sector, its share is estimated to rise from 43% in 2004 to 45% in 2030. More than 80% of the growth in global coal demand is expected to come from China and India. These two countries comprise approximately 45% of global coal use, which is projected by IEA to grow to 80% by 2030. China alone added an estimated 96 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation in 2007, representing more than 300 million tons of annual coal use. Coal demand in India is forecasted to nearly triple by 2030. In total, global coal consumption is expected to grow 73%, or more than 4 billion tons by 2030. Our primary U.S. customers are utilities, which accounted for 85% of our sales in 2007. Our international production is sold primarily into export markets. Our international activities accounted for 13% of our sales by volume in 2007. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2007, approximately 94% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2007, production totaled 214.1 million tons and sales totaled 237.8 million tons. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could 51 be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. However, we expect to adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Eastern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations, and our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The principal business of the Western and Eastern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Geologically, Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits and Eastern operations mine bituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by a mix of surface and underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as steam coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a small portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. In the second half of 2006, through two separate transactions, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel), an independent coal company in Australia for a total acquisition price of US$1.51 billion, net of cash received, plus approximately $293.0 million in assumed debt. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for information on the financing of the Excel transaction. Assets acquired include three operating mines and three development stage mines, along with up to 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 6 to 8 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. During 2007, the Paso Diablo Mine contributed $21.2 million to segment Adjusted EBITDA in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and paid a dividend of $12.9 million. At December 31, 2007, our investment in Paso Diablo was $68.4 million. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from four of our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 4% of our total sales volume, but represents a larger share of our revenue, approximately 15% in 2007. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 92% of revenues in 2007, we generate revenues and additional cash flows from our Trading and Brokerage operations (7% of revenues), and other activities, including transactions utilizing our vast natural resource position (selling non core land holdings and mineral interests). We continue to pursue the development of coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. The projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. We own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. We are pursuing development of the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The plants, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. The EIA projects that the high price of oil will lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including Btu Conversion technologies, and that coal will increase its share as a fuel for electricity generation. We are exploring several Btu Conversion projects, which are designed to expand the 52 uses of coal through various technologies, and we are continuing to explore options particularly as they relate to Btu Conversion technologies such as coal to liquids and coal gasification. In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares for $99.8 million under this repurchase program. On October 31, 2007, we spun off portions of our Eastern U.S. Mining operations business segment to form Patriot. We distributed Patriot stock to our stockholders at a ratio of one share of Patriot stock for every 10 shares of Peabody stock held on the record date of October 22, 2007. Our results for all periods presented reflect Patriot as a discontinued operation. The spin off included eight company operated mines, two majority owned joint venture mines, and numerous contractor operated mines serviced by eight coal preparation facilities along with 1.2 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Prior to the spin off, we received necessary regulatory approvals including a private letter ruling on the tax free nature of the transaction from the Internal Revenue Service. Results of Operations The portions of the Eastern U.S. Mining operations business segment that were included in the spin off of Patriot have been classified as discontinued operations and are excluded from the operating results for all periods presented. See the description of the spin off in Part I, Item 1 Discontinued Operations. Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Summary Higher average sales prices across all U.S. regions and increased volumes, primarily from Australian Mining operations, contributed to an 11.4% increase in revenues to $4.57 billion compared to 2006. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.4% to $1.06 billion primarily on higher prices in the Western U.S. and increased results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues, higher commodity costs, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar. Also, negatively impacting Australian Mining results was lower metallurgical coal prices associated with annual contracts that began in April 2007. Income from continuing operations was $421.3 million in 2007, or $1.56 per diluted share, a decrease of 23.8% from 2006 income from continuing operations of $552.6 million, or $2.05 per diluted share. 53 Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2007 2006 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 161.4 160.5 0.9 0.6 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 30.9 30.4 0.5 1.6 % Australian Mining Operations 21.4 11.0 10.4 94.5 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 24.1 21.4 2.7 12.6 % Total tons sold 237.8 223.3 14.5 6.5 % Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 2,061,265 $ 1,703,445 $ 357,820 21.0 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 984,841 905,743 79,098 8.7 % Australian Mining Operations 1,161,093 843,194 317,899 37.7 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 320,692 652,029 (331,337 ) (50.8 )% Other 46,821 3,985 42,836 1074.9 % Total revenues $ 4,574,712 $ 4,108,396 $ 466,316 11.4 % In 2007, our total revenues were $4.57 billion, an increase of $466.3 million, or 11.4%, compared to the prior year, which resulted from sales price increases in all U.S. regions, most notably in our Powder River Basin operations and increased volumes from Australia. Volumes related to operations acquired in the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 10.9 million tons of the increase to tons sold. Partially offsetting sales price and volume increases was the continued shift towards trading contracts versus brokerage contracts in our Trading and Brokerage operations. Trading and Brokerage operations sales decreased during the year as the amount of brokerage business was reduced and replacement business was in the form of traded contracts. Contracts for trading activity are recorded at net margin in other revenues, whereas contracts for brokerage activity are recorded at gross sales price to revenues and operating costs. While the shift to trading contracts reduced total sales, there was no impact to Adjusted EBITDA. Overall, prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased due to a sales realization increase of approximately 29% for our premium Powder River Basin product and an average increase across all U.S. regions of 16%. In addition, Eastern U.S. Mining revenues increased due to higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants as those plants were idled for part of 2006. Offsetting this increase was lower average sales prices in our Australian Mining operations related to lower metallurgical contract pricing and a significant change in sales mix resulting in higher thermal export and domestic product sales. Volumes were unfavorably impacted at some of our Australian Mining operations as a result of damaged rails and further amplified port and rail congestion throughout the year, in addition to adverse weather events in the second quarter that affected production. 54 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $1.06 billion for the year ended 2007, compared with $1.03 billion in the prior year. Details were as follows: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 597,333 $ 473,074 $ 124,259 26.3 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 196,595 184,549 12,046 6.5 % Australian Mining Operations 159,473 278,411 (118,938 ) (42.7 )% Trading and Brokerage Operations 110,169 92,604 17,565 19.0 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,063,570 $ 1,028,638 $ 34,932 3.4 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $124.3 million, or 26.3%, during the year primarily related to the overall increase in average sales prices from our Powder River Basin operations. Partially offsetting higher average sales prices were higher costs associated with equipment repairs and maintenance and higher add on taxes and royalties driven by higher sales prices compared to the prior year, mine shutdown for maintenance in our Colorado region in December, higher fuel costs and adverse weather conditions in the Powder River Basin and capital project delays in the first half of the year. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 6.5%, compared to prior year as both volumes and prices per ton saw moderate increases. Results improved compared to prior year as benefits of higher volumes and sales prices were offset by higher costs for commodities, including fuel. The 2007 results were also positively impacted by higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel facilities of $12.5 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants for a portion of 2006. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased $118.9 million, or 42.7%, compared to prior year primarily due to approximately $31 million of higher costs resulting from the weakening U.S. dollar (higher costs of approximately $112 million were offset by hedging gains of $81 million); higher congestion related demurrage costs (approximately $50 million); lower pricing on annually repriced metallurgical coal contracts; and, rail and port congestion at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and the Port of Newcastle. Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal has been experiencing queues of over 41 vessels (approximately a 24 day load time) down from 50 vessels in the second quarter (approximately a 34 day delay). Partially offsetting these decreases were the full year contributions from our mines acquired in the Excel acquisition and a $6.3 million insurance recovery on a business interruption claim in the first half of 2007. Our Australian mines acquired in 2006 experienced shipping difficulties and damaged rail lines resulting from a storm late in the second quarter. The Port of Newcastle was closed for several days in June due to a storm, with up to 79 vessels in the queue (a 35 40 day wait). Queues at Newcastle have recently been reduced to 31 vessels (11 day wait). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.6 million from the prior year, as 2007 results reflected higher international trading gains, resulting from higher volumes and pricing due to expanded global trading activities, strong supply/demand fundamentals and tightened seaborne market conditions. 55 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,063,570 $ 1,028,638 $ 34,932 3.4 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (107,677 ) (127,682 ) 20,005 15.7 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (361,559 ) (294,270 ) (67,289 ) (22.9 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (25,610 ) (15,830 ) (9,780 ) (61.8 )% Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (234,983 ) (139,064 ) (95,919 ) (69.0 )% Interest income 7,094 11,309 (4,215 ) (37.3 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 340,835 $ 463,101 $ (122,266 ) (26.4 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests of $340.8 million for 2007 is $122.3 million, or 26.4%, lower than 2006 primarily due to higher interest expense and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the acquisition of Excel in late 2006. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint venture, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, Btu Conversion and resource management. The $20.0 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2007 compared to 2006 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $35.2 million. The 2007 activity included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves to the Prairie State equity partners. Our 2007 activity also included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of our coalbed methane and oil and gas rights in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for high Btu coal reserves located in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. In comparison, the 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million; Higher past mining obligation expenses of $15.5 million resulting from increased retiree healthcare costs due to higher than anticipated healthcare utilization by retirees, particularly related to prescription drugs; Higher selling and administrative expenses of $19.1 million during the year primarily resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and other corporate development initiatives; and Lower equity income of $6.8 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela), which primarily resulted from trucking issues experienced earlier in the year, a temporary shortage of explosives, and delays in receiving equipment, which impacted operations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $67.3 million primarily related to the addition of the Australian operations acquired in late 2006. Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs increased $95.9 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion in new debt issued or assumed as part of the Excel acquisition in the second half of 2006. 56 Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 340,835 $ 463,101 $ (122,266 ) (26.4 )% Income tax benefit 78,112 90,084 (11,972 ) (13.3 )% Minority interests 2,316 (611 ) 2,927 479.1 % Income from continuing operations 421,263 552,574 (131,311 ) (23.8 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations (156,978 ) 48,123 (205,101 ) (426.2 )% Net income $ 264,285 $ 600,697 $ (336,412 ) (56.0 )% Income from continuing operations decreased $131.3 million in 2007 compared to prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and a lower income tax benefit compared to 2006. The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended 2007 related primarily to a $56.0 million foreign currency impact on deferred taxes as a result of increases in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rates and $33.2 million lower tax reserves than in the prior year, partially offset by lower pre tax income, a $10.3 million increase in released valuation allowances, and $24.3 million of additional tax credits. Minority interests increased primarily from the absorption of losses in excess of the minority interest capital contribution at one of our mines, partially offset by lower earnings allocable to partners. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Summary Higher average sales prices and increased volumes in the Eastern U.S., Powder River Basin and Australian Mining operations, including the October 2006 acquisition of three mines in Australia, contributed to a 12.1% increase in revenues to $4.11 billion compared to 2005. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 17.8% to $1.03 billion primarily on growth in international volumes and higher sales prices from our Australian Mining operations and increased contributions from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by operational challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from rail performance in the Powder River Basin and port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues as well as mine closures in our Western U.S. Mining operations in late 2005. Net income was $600.7 million in 2006, or $2.23 per diluted share, an increase of 42.1% over 2005 net income of $422.7 million, or $1.58 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 160.5 154.3 6.2 4.0 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 30.4 28.7 1.7 5.9 % Australian Mining Operations 11.0 8.3 2.7 32.5 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 21.4 24.8 (3.4 ) (13.7 )% Total tons sold 223.3 216.1 7.2 3.3 % 57 Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 1,703,445 $ 1,611,587 $ 91,858 5.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 905,743 760,404 145,339 19.1 % Australian Mining Operations 843,194 598,085 245,109 41.0 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 652,029 679,176 (27,147 ) (4.0 )% Other 3,985 16,924 (12,939 ) (76.5 )% Total revenues $ 4,108,396 $ 3,666,176 $ 442,220 12.1 % In 2006, our total revenues were $4.11 billion, an increase of $442.2 million, or 12.1%, compared to prior year, which resulted from sales price increases in all regions, particularly in our Eastern and Australian operations and demand driven sales volume increases in the Powder River Basin, Midwest and Australian operations. Volumes related to the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 2.1 million tons of the increase to tons sold and approximately 43% of the increase to sales in Australia. Partially offsetting sales price increases were lower western regional sales due to the late 2005 mine closures in the Western U.S. Mining operations and lower brokerage volumes. Overall, prices and volumes in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased, mainly reflecting increases to sales prices of over $0.70 per ton and volumes of 12.7 million tons in the Powder River Basin. These increases at our Powder River Basin operations resulted from strong demand for the mines low sulfur products and improved rail conditions compared to 2005, when the region was dealing with major railroad maintenance. Despite rail performance improvements relative to 2005, constrained rail capacity continued to limit growth in the region in 2006. Also, affecting Western U.S. Mining revenues was lower production due to the cessation of mining operations at our Seneca and Black Mesa mines in late 2005 and unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues at our Twentymile Mine. Per ton sales prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased and sales volumes increased due primarily to our Gateway mine, which began operation in late 2005. Partially offset by the overall increase in 2006 total revenues was the customer idling of synfuel plants during 2006. Revenues from our Australian Mining operations were $245.1 million, or 41.0%, higher than in 2005, primarily due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, higher production at our underground mine following installation of a new longwall in the second quarter of 2006 and additional volumes from our newly acquired mines ($105.1 million). A higher per ton sales price reflected higher contract prices in 2006 for metallurgical coal as well as the slower realization of metallurgical coal price increases in 2005 when we operated under some lower priced carry over contracts from 2004 through most of the first nine months of 2005. Brokerage operations revenues decreased $27.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher sales prices and proceeds of $28.2 million from settlement of commitments by a third party coal producer following a brokerage contract restructuring. 58 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $1.03 billion for the year ended 2006 compared with $873.5 million in 2005. Details were as follows: Segment Adjusted EBITDA Increase to Segment Year Ended December 31, Adjusted EBITDA 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 473,074 $ 459,039 $ 14,035 3.1 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 184,549 168,793 15,756 9.3 % Australian Mining Operations 278,411 202,582 75,829 37.4 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 92,604 43,058 49,546 115.1 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,028,638 $ 873,472 $ 155,166 17.8 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $14.0 million, or 3.1%, during 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in sales volumes of 12.7 million tons at our Powder River Basin operations, which resulted from continued strong demand and improved rail performance relative to 2005. Western U.S. Mining operations sales price per ton increased moderately due to mix changes resulting from ceasing operations at our Black Mesa and Seneca mines. Western U.S. Mining operations cost increases were driven by higher fuel costs, an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes, and the timing of major repairs. In addition, we experienced unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues related to the new longwall system at our Twentymile Mine; however, a recovery of certain costs associated with the equipment difficulties lessened the impact of these issues on our 2006 results. The Western U.S. Mining operations were also negatively impacted in 2006 by the cessation of operations at the Black Mesa mine in late 2005. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $15.8 million, or 9.3%, compared to 2005 primarily due to higher volumes and sales prices, partially offset by higher costs per ton due to fuel costs, revenue based royalties and production taxes as well as higher costs associated with equipment and geologic issues. The 2006 results were also negatively impacted by lower revenues from synthetic fuel facilities of $10.1 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $75.8 million, or 37.4%, compared to 2005 primarily due to increased sales volumes following increased production from the second quarter installation of a new longwall system at our underground mine, higher metallurgical coal sales prices, and a $19.7 million contribution from our newly acquired mines. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $49.5 million from 2005, as 2006 results included proceeds from restructuring the brokerage contract mentioned above, improved brokerage margins and contributions from the newly established international trading operation, partially offset by lower U.S. trading results. 59 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,028,638 $ 873,472 $ 155,166 17.8 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (127,682 ) (165,623 ) 37,941 22.9 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (294,270 ) (253,788 ) (40,482 ) (16.0 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (15,830 ) (20,329 ) 4,499 22.1 % Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (139,064 ) (98,066 ) (40,998 ) (41.8 )% Interest income 11,309 9,088 2,221 24.4 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 463,101 $ 344,754 $ 118,347 34.3 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests of $463.1 million for 2006 is $118.3 million, or 34.3%, higher than 2005 primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, Btu Conversion and resource management. The $37.9 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2006 compared to 2005 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $9.1 million. The 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million. In comparison, activity in 2005 included a $31.1 million gain from the sale of our remaining 0.838 million units of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P., a $12.5 million gain from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and properties, and other gains on asset disposals of $0.8 million; Higher equity income of $8.0 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela; Lower selling and administrative expenses of $4.6 million primarily associated with lower performance based incentive costs, partially offset by increases to share based compensation expense as a result of the new requirement to expense stock options, costs to support corporate and international growth initiatives and costs for the development and installation of a new enterprise resource planning system. The lower costs associated with the performance based incentive plan related to a long term, executive incentive plan that is driven by shareholder return and reflected lower stock price appreciation in 2006 than in 2005; and Lower net expenses of $4.7 million related to the development of the Prairie State Energy Campus due to a higher rate of cost reimbursement from the partners in 2006. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $40.5 million in 2006 due to higher production volume, acquisitions and the impact of escalating capital costs and new capital, including two new longwall installations and new mine development. Also, 2005 depreciation, depletion and amortization was net of amortization of acquired contract liabilities. Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs increased $41.0 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion of debt issued or assumed in the second half of 2006 as part of the Excel acquisition. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more details of the debt issued. 60 Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 463,101 $ 344,754 $ 118,347 34.3 % Income tax benefit (provision) 90,084 (63,779 ) 153,863 241.2 % Minority interests (611 ) (2,472 ) 1,861 75.3 % Income from continuing operations 552,574 278,503 274,071 98.4 % Income from discontinued operations 48,123 144,150 (96,027 ) (66.6 )% Net income $ 600,697 $ 422,653 $ 178,044 42.1 % Income from continuing operations increased $274.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and an income tax benefit compared to an income tax provision in 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended 2006 related primarily to a reduction in tax reserves no longer required due to the finalization of various federal and state returns and expiration of applicable statute of limitations, and a reduction in a portion of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards. The reduction to the valuation allowance resulted from an increase to estimated future taxable income primarily resulting from long term contracts signed in late 2006 which increased our ability to realize these benefits in the future. Minority interests increased primarily as a result of acquiring an additional interest in a joint venture near the end of the first quarter of 2006. Outlook Events Impacting Near Term Operations Global coal markets continued to grow, driven by increased demand from growing and developing economies. The U.S. economy grew 2.2% for 2007 as reported by the U.S. Commerce Department, while Chinas economy grew 11.4% in 2007 as published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Growing constraints of global coal supplies ignited U.S. coal export interests beginning in the third quarter of 2007. By the start of 2008, global supply challenges became even greater. Flooding in Queensland, Australia in early 2008 is estimated to reduce seaborne coal supplies by more than 10 million metric tons; China issued a temporary moratorium on 2008 coal exports to secure supply for domestic needs, and South Africa temporarily shutdown coal production destined for export markets to conserve energy while reestablishing sufficient domestic coal supply. As a result, U.S. coal products are realizing expanded market reach resulting in higher published prices for all products. We expect to capitalize on the strong global markets primarily through production and sales of metallurgical and thermal coal from our Australian operations as well as through our U.S. and international coal trading activities. In Australia, we anticipate selling 23 to 25 million tons in 2008, as much as 17% higher than 2007s level. Of our anticipated shipments, we have nine to 10 million tons of coal production available to be priced in 2008, approximately two thirds of which is metallurgical coal. Our 2008 results will be affected by the final Australian coal price settlements. Our two primary shipping points, Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and Port of Newcastle, continue to experience lengthy vessel queues, extreme weather conditions impacting operations and the coal logistics chain, and transportation challenges, which could result in delayed shipments and demurrage charges. In the U.S., we anticipate higher volumes in 2008 versus 2007 from all the coal basins where we operate. Approximately 97% of our higher 2008 volumes are committed to existing customer contracts. In addition, the higher 2008 volume includes the mid year startup of a new mine in the Southwestern U.S. Our 2008 results will be impacted to the extent we complete ramp up activities on time and at expected capacity. Although we 61 currently expect to increase our shipment levels, our ability to reach targeted volumes is dependent upon the performance of the rail carriers. We expect strong improvements in U.S. and Australia operating results from higher prices and increased volumes, partly offset by some of the factors discussed above and escalation of key supply costs including approximately $150 million in higher energy related expenses and the effects of exchange rates. Long term Outlook Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as growth continues in the U.S., Asia and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. More than 100 gigawatts of new coal fueled electricity generating capacity is scheduled to come on line around the world between 2008 and 2010, and the EIA projects an additional 130 gigawatts of new U.S. coal fueled generation by 2030, including 9 gigawatts at coal to liquids plants and 45 gigawatts at integrated gasification combined cycle plants, which represents more than 500 million tons of additional coal demand. Coal to gas (CTG) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants represent a significant avenue for long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including CTL, and in the U.S. CTL technologies are receiving U.S. support from both political parties. China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. Demand for Powder River Basin coal remains strong, particularly for our ultra low sulfur products. The Powder River Basin represents more than half of our production. We control approximately 3.3 billion tons of proven and probable reserves in the Southern Powder River Basin, and we sold 139.8 million tons of coal from this region during 2007. We are targeting 2008 production of 220 to 240 million tons and total sales volume of 240 to 260 million tons, both of which include 23 to 25 million tons from Australia. As of December 31, 2007, our unpriced volumes for 2008 planned production included nine to 10 million Australian tons, two thirds of which is metallurgical coal, and five to seven million U.S. tons. Unpriced volumes for 2009 include 17 to 20 million Australian tons, approximately half of which is metallurgical coal, and 80 to 90 million U.S. tons. Management plans to aggressively control costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs, including a company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. In addition, historically low long term interest rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the United States or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, could result in electric generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. We continue to support clean coal technology development and voluntary initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation as a founding member of the FutureGen Alliance, through our commitment to the Australian COAL21 Fund, and through our participation in the Power Systems Development Facility, the PowerTree Carbon Company LLC, and the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate. In addition, we are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, the first near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) which is under development in China. 62 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities We have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006 resulted in each of these liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 being equal to the actuarially determined funded status of the plans. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $102.2 million, while payments were $71.6 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 11,202 $ (9,580 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 81,535 $ (70,842 ) 63 Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 1,076 $ (1,913 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (35,166 ) $ 41,399 Total (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.92 years at December 31, 2007. Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $25.6 million, and payments totaled $10.2 million. See detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Additional details regarding the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in Note 12. Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the 64 financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 95% of our revenue in 2007 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of coal supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal, freight and emissions allowances, both in over the counter markets and on exchanges. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal, freight and emission allowance positions from the over the counter market. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Published settlement prices are used to value our exchange based positions. As of December 31, 2007, 97% of the contracts in our trading portfolio were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials. As of December 31, 2007, 58% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2008 and 99% within 24 months. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Exploration and Drilling Costs Exploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Advance Stripping Costs Pre production: At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre production box cut to remove overburden (i.e., advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (i.e., advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices. Post production: Advance stripping costs related to post production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, we expense such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment. 65 Business Combinations We account for our business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment, and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which we adopted using the modified prospective option on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123(R), share based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award. We utilize restricted stock, nonqualified stock options, performance units, and an employee stock purchase plan as part of our share based compensation program. Determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions, including items such as expected term, risk free rate and expected volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including sales of our accounts receivable through our securitization program. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as planned acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends, among other things, are subject to limitations imposed by our Senior Notes and Debenture covenants. We expect to fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $447.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of $144.2 million compared to $591.4 million provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to lower profitability from our operations. Net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations of $130.8 million was primarily used to fund the regions net operating loss and for cash costs of the spin off. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $541.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $2.06 billion used in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to the acquisition of Excel of $1.51 billion, net of cash acquired, in 2006 and higher proceeds of $90.2 million from disposals of assets in 2007. Partially offsetting these items was higher capital spending of $72.9 million. Capital expenditures in 2007 included mine development at our recently acquired Australian mines, the completion of an in pit conveyor system, and coal blending and loadout facility at one of our Western U.S. mines and the purchase of coal reserves and surface lands in the Illinois Basin. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was $33.6 million and was used for pre spin capital costs for Patriot. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $44.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $1.41 billion provided in 2006. During 2007, we repaid $37.9 million of our Term Loan and purchased in the open market $13.8 million face value of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. We also made the final principal payment of $59.5 million on our 5% Subordinated Note. Our Revolving Credit Facility balance increased to $97.7 million as it was utilized to fund cash contributions to 66 Patriot at the spin off. In 2006, we issued net borrowings of $1.74 billion, which we utilized to fund the $1.51 billion Excel acquisition, the repayment of Excels bank facility and a portion of its outstanding bonds, and other corporate purposes. The net issuance of debt related to the Excel acquisition was partially offset in 2006 by repurchases of $7.7 million of our 5.875% Senior Notes in the open market, scheduled debt repayments of $11.1 million on our 5% Subordinated Note and other notes payable, and $99.8 million for the repurchase of common stock. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations of $67.0 million was primarily cash provided to Patriot at spin off to fund their working capital needs. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 consisted of the following: December 31, 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 509,084 $ 547,000 Revolving Credit Facility 97,700 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 732,500 732,500 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 650,000 650,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 246,965 246,897 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 218,090 231,845 5.0% Subordinated Note 59,504 6.84% Series C Bonds due 2016 43,000 43,000 6.34% Series B Bonds due 2014 21,000 21,000 6.84% Series A Bonds due 2014 10,000 10,000 Capital lease obligations 92,186 96,869 Fair value of interest rate swaps 1,604 (13,784 ) Other 971 2,201 Total $ 3,273,100 $ 3,277,032 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2006, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a $2.75 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and which amended and restated in full our then existing $1.35 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. The Term Loan Facility, which was fully drawn in October 2006 in connection with the Excel acquisition was paid down in December 2006 ($403.0 million), from a portion of the net proceeds from the Debentures. In conjunction with the establishment of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we incurred $8.6 million in financing costs, of which $5.6 million related to the Revolving Credit Facility and $3.0 million related to the Term Loan Facility. These debt issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over five years, the term of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third 67 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Currently, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus 0.75%, which at December 31, 2007 was 5.4%. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The new facility is less restrictive with respect to limitations on our dividend payments, capital expenditures, asset sales or stock repurchases. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2007, we had $97.7 million borrowings and $413.5 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility is primarily used for standby letters of credit and short term working capital needs. The remaining available borrowing capacity ($1.29 billion as of December 31, 2007) can be used to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs, including additional standby letters of credit. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures as of December 31, 2007. Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures On December 20, 2006, we issued $732.5 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (the Debentures). Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $715.0 million and were used to repay indebtedness under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. The Debentures pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.75% per year. We may elect to, and if and to the extent that a mandatory trigger event (as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures) has occurred and is continuing will be required to, defer interest payments on the Debentures. After five years of deferral at our option, or upon the occurrence of a mandatory trigger event, we generally must sell warrants or preferred stock with specified characteristics and use the funds from that sale to pay deferred interest, subject to certain limitations. In no event may we defer payments of interest on the Debentures for more than 10 years. The Debentures are convertible at any time on or prior to December 15, 2036 if any of the following conditions occur: (i) our closing common stock price exceeds 140% of the then applicable conversion price for the Debentures (currently $81.83 per share) for at least 20 of the final 30 trading days in any quarter; (ii) a notice of redemption is issued with respect to the Debentures; (iii) a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures; (iv) satisfaction of certain trading price conditions; and (v) other specified corporate transactions described in the indenture governing the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures are convertible at any time after December 15, 2036 to December 15, 2041, the scheduled maturity date. In the case of conversion following a notice of redemption or upon a non stock change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures, holders may convert their Debentures into cash in the amount of the principal amount of their Debentures and shares of our common stock for any conversion value in excess of the principal amount. In all other conversion circumstances, holders will receive perpetual preferred stock (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements) with a liquidation preference equal to the principal amount of their Debentures, and any conversion value in excess of the principal amount will be settled with our common stock. As a result of the Patriot spin off, the conversion rate was adjusted to 17.1078 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures effective November 23, 2007. This adjusted conversion rate represents a conversion price of approximately $58.45. The Debentures are unsecured obligations, ranking junior to all existing and future senior and subordinated debt (excluding trade accounts payable or accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business) except for any future debt that ranks equal to or junior to the Debentures. The Debentures will rank equal in right of payment with our obligations to trade creditors. Substantially, all of our existing indebtedness is senior to the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness of 68 our subsidiaries. The indenture governing the Debentures places no limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that we or any of our subsidiaries may incur (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Debentures). 7.375% Senior Notes Due November 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes Due November 2026 On October 12, 2006, we completed a $650.0 million offering of 7.375% 10 year Senior Notes due 2016 and $250 million of 7.875% 20 year Senior Notes due 2026. The notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness; equally in right of payment with any senior indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and effectively junior to all the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and commenced on May 1, 2007. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors, as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions. The notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make whole premium, if applicable, and any accrued unpaid interest to the redemption date. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, were $886.1 million. 6.875% Senior Notes Due March 2013 On March 21, 2003, we issued $650.0 million of 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, pay dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and investments, create liens, sell assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The notes are redeemable prior to March 15, 2008, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium (as defined in the indenture) and on or after March 15, 2008, at fixed redemption prices as set forth in the indenture. 5.875% Senior Notes Due March 2016 On March 23, 2004, we completed an offering of $250.0 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due March 2016. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and commenced on April 15, 2004. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, pay dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and investments, create liens, sell assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The notes are redeemable prior to April 15, 2009, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium (as defined in the indenture) and on or after April 15, 2009, at fixed redemption prices as set forth in the indenture. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, were $244.7 million. Series Bonds As of December 31, 2007, we had $74.0 million in Series Bonds outstanding, which were assumed as part of the Excel acquisition. The 6.84% Series A Bonds have a balloon maturity in December 2014. The 6.34% Series B Bonds mature in December 2014 and are payable in installments beginning December 2008. The 6.84% Series C Bonds mature in December 2016 and are payable in installments beginning December 2012. Interest payments are scheduled to occur in June and December of each year. 69 Interest Rate Swaps As of December 31, 2007, we had entered into a series of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of $120.0 million. Under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate of 6.875% and pay a weighted average floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%, which resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15. The swaps have been designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. We have also entered into another series of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of $100.0 million. Under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate of 5.875% and pay a weighted average floating rate of LIBOR plus 0.25%, which resets each April 15 and October 15. This series of swaps has been designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. In conjunction with the Term Loan Facility, we have a floating to fixed interest rate swap in place for a notional principal amount of $120.0 million. Under the terms of this swap we receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.0% and pay a fixed rate of 6.25%. This interest rate swap was designated as a hedge of the variable interest payments on the Term Loan under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Because the critical terms of the swaps and the respective debt instruments they hedge coincide, there was no hedge ineffectiveness recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 there was an unrealized loss related to the cash flow hedge of $6.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007, there was a net unrealized gain on the fair value hedges of $1.6 million. At December 31, 2006, the net unrealized loss on the fair value hedges was $13.8 million. The fair value hedge is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying value of the Senior Notes (see table above). Third party Security Ratings The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB rating and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on our Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B rating and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement On July 28, 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we can file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. The Debentures, 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Excel Transaction In October 2006, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel) for US$1.54 billion in cash plus assumed debt of US$293.0 million, less US$30.0 million of cash acquired in the transaction. This acquisition was financed with borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and Senior Notes due 2016 and 2026 (see Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the financing of the Excel acquisition). The Excel acquisition included three operating mines and three development stage mines (all of which are 70 operating as of December 31, 2007), with up to 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. The results of operations of Excel are included in our Australian Mining Operations segment from October 2006. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Excel acquisition). Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,781,312 $ 344,324 $ 471,852 $ 825,632 $ 4,139,504 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 116,861 17,349 34,258 30,234 35,020 Operating lease obligations 359,045 85,356 120,218 71,759 81,712 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 168,923 168,923 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 383,416 187,946 139,564 12,777 43,129 Other long term liabilities(2) 1,302,039 112,418 215,443 210,275 763,903 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,111,596 $ 916,316 $ 981,335 $ 1,150,677 $ 5,063,268 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2007, we had $67.8 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $301.6 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next three years. Total capital expenditures for 2008 are expected to range from $350 million to $400 million, excluding federal coal reserve lease payments, and relate to replacement, improvement, or expansion of existing mines, particularly in Australia, the El Segundo mine development in New Mexico, and growth initiatives such as increasing capacity in the Powder River Basin. Capital expenditures were funded primarily through operating cash flow. Our subsidiary, Peabody Pacific, has committed to pay up to a maximum of A$0.20/tonne (approximately US$0.15/tonne) of coal sales for a period of five years to the Australian COAL21 Fund. The COAL21 Fund is a voluntary coal industry fund to support clean coal technology demonstration projects and research in Australia. All major coal companies in Australia have committed to this fund. The commitment to pay started on April 1, 2007 with a levy of A$0.10/tonne of coal sales. This levy rose to A$0.20/tonne on July 1, 2007. We do not expect any of the $152.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. 71 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2007: Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self Bonding $ 640.6 $ $ $ $ $ 640.6 Surety Bonds 418.3 73.0 31.2 16.7 539.2 Letters of Credit 1.6 102.7 41.4 267.9 413.6 $ 1,060.5 $ 73.0 $ 133.9 $ 41.4 $ 284.6 $ 1,593.4 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the PBGC and collateral for surety companies. As part of arrangements through which we obtain exclusive sales representation agreements with small coal mining companies (the Counterparties), we issued financial guarantees on behalf of the Counterparties. These guarantees facilitate the Counterparties efforts to obtain bonding or financing. In 2007, we purchased approximately 345 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands in the Illinois Basin. In conjunction with this purchase, we agreed to provide up to $64.8 million of reclamation and bonding commitments to a third party coal company. We have recognized the full amount of these commitments as a liability as of December 31, 2007. The non cash portion of this transaction was excluded from the investing section of the statement of cash flows. In the event of default, the terms of our guarantees provide for multiple recourse options, including the ability to assume the loans and procure title and use of the equipment purchased through the loans. If default occurs, we have the ability and intent to exercise our recourse options, so the liability associated with the guarantee has been valued at zero. The aggregate amount guaranteed for all such Counterparties was $8.8 million at December 31, 2007. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of our guarantees. As part of the Patriot spin off, we agreed to maintain in force several letters of credit that secured Patriot obligations for certain employee benefits and workers compensation obligations. These letters of credit are to be released upon Patriot satisfying the beneficiaries with alternate letters of credit or insurance, which is expected to occur in 2008. If Patriot is unable to satisfy the primary beneficiaries by June 30, 2011, they are then required to provide directly to us a letter of credit in the amount of the remaining obligation. As of December 31, 2007, the amount of letters of credit securing Patriot obligations was $136.8 million. Under our accounts receivable securitization program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $11.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The securitization program is scheduled to expire in September 2009. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the 72 consolidated balance sheets. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $275.0 million and $219.2 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounts receivable securitization). The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2007: Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Over Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 1,800,000 $ $ $ 1,800,000 $ Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48). This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, and as a result, reported $135.0 million of net unrecognized tax benefits ($144.0 million gross) in our consolidated financial statements. Due to the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset for NOL carryforwards as of January 1, 2007, none of the $135.0 million required an adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158). For fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, SFAS No. 158 required recognition of the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans (an asset for overfunded status or a liability for underfunded status) in a companys balance sheet. In addition, the standard required recognition of actuarial gains and losses, prior service cost, and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS No. 106) when determining a plans funded status, with a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We adopted SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006, and as a result, recorded a noncurrent liability of $376.1 million, which reflected the total underfunded status of the pension, retiree healthcare and workers compensation plans. The funded status of each plan was measured as the difference between the fair value of the assets and the projected benefit obligation (the funded status). SFAS No. 158 did not impact net income. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and therefore does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008 for the Company). In February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS No. 157 to exclude leasing transactions and to delay the effective date by one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 73 provides all entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008 for the Company). We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for (1) noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and (2) the loss of control of subsidiaries. SFAS No. 160 requires noncontrolling interests (minority interests) to be reported as a separate component of equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. SFAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for the Company). Early adoption is not allowed. We are in the process of determining the effect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R) significantly changes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This statement also provides guidance for the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination and for determination of required disclosures that will enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for the Company). We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal, freight and emissions allowance trading, fuel, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal, freight and emissions allowance trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading fuel, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter, exchange based and direct trading of coal, freight and emission allowances (collectively coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the 74 potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both swaps and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes 5 and 15 day holding periods, as applicable, and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our value at risk measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the combined actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $1.2 million, $13.7 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. Our value at risk increased over the prior year due to greater price volatility in the coal markets, particularly in the international markets into which we have recently expanded. As of December 31, 2007, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Percentage Year of Expiration of Portfolio 2008 58 % 2009 41 % 2010 0 % 2011 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. In general, increases in coal price volatility and our own trading activity resulted in greater exposure to our coal trading counterparties during the year. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. 75 Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2008 targets hedging at least approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2007, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling A$2.03 billion of which A$1.08 billion, A$556.7 million, and A$388.8 million will expire in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in Operating costs and expenses due to a $0.01 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $12 million for 2008. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $1.6 million in 2008. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.57 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $707.2 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $7.1 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $0.3 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 94% and 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we had 5 to 10 million tons of expected U.S. production unpriced for 2008. We had 9 to 10 million tons remaining to be priced for 2008 in Australia at December 31, 2007. We have approximately 80 to 90 million tons of expected U.S. production unpriced for 2009, with an additional 17 to 20 million tons of expected Australia coal production unpriced for 2009. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. As of December 31, 2007, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel and explosives. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts were 114.8 million gallons of crude oil scheduled to expire through 2010. We expect to consume 125 to 130 million gallons of fuel next year. A one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $2.4 million. Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts, scheduled to expire through 2010, were 5.7 mmbtu of natural gas. We expect to consume 315,000 to 325,000 tons of explosives per year. Through our natural gas hedge contracts, we have fixed prices for approximately 49% of our anticipated explosives requirements for 2008. Based on our expected usage, a change in natural gas prices of ten cents per mmbtu (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our operating costs of approximately $0.6 million per year. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot Coal Corporation as discontinued operations. 48 In October 2006, we acquired Excel Coal Limited and our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the results of operations of the three operating mines and three development stage mines (all of which are operating as of December 31, 2007) in New South Wales, Australia and Queensland, Australia from the date of acquisition. On April 15, 2004, we acquired three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the results of operations of the two mines in Queensland, Australia and the results of operations of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado from the April 15, 2004 purchase date. Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 included early debt extinguishment costs of $53.5 million pursuant to our debt refinancing in the first half of 2003. In addition, results included expense relating to the cumulative effect of accounting changes, net of income taxes, of $10.1 million. This amount represents the aggregate amount of the recognition of accounting changes pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the change in method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses related to net periodic postretirement benefit costs and the effect of the rescission of Emerging Issues Task Force No. 98 10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 from our audited financial statements. You should read the following table in conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 49 The results of operations for the historical periods included in the following table are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 31 coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions, except Appalachia, and international interests in Australia and Venezuela. In 2007, we sold 237.8 million tons of coal. Our U.S. sales represented 19% of all U.S. coal sales and were approximately 80% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. United States coal demand was approximately 1.1 billion tons in 2007, based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Coals predominate use is for baseload electricity requirements. For the 12 months ended November 2007, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 50%, a share that the EIA projects will grow to 55% by 2030. EIA projects an additional 130 gigawatts of new U.S. coal fueled generation by 2030, including 9 gigawatts at coal to liquids plants and 45 gigawatts at integrated gasification combined cycle plants, which represents more than 500 million tons of additional coal demand. Domestic coal consumption is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.8% from 2007 through 2030 when U.S. coal demand is forecasted to reach 1.7 billion tons. Coal production located west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth as Western production increases to an estimated 65% share of total production in 2030 versus 58% in 2007. Globally, we believe that coal demand is driven by electricity generation (65%) and industrial use (31%), including steel making. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates coals share of total world energy consumption is projected to increase from 25% in 2005 to 28% through 2030, and in the electric power sector, its share is estimated to rise from 43% in 2004 to 45% in 2030. More than 80% of the growth in global coal demand is expected to come from China and India. These two countries comprise approximately 45% of global coal use, which is projected by IEA to grow to 80% by 2030. China alone added an estimated 96 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation in 2007, representing more than 300 million tons of annual coal use. Coal demand in India is forecasted to nearly triple by 2030. In total, global coal consumption is expected to grow 73%, or more than 4 billion tons by 2030. Our primary U.S. customers are utilities, which accounted for 85% of our sales in 2007. Our international production is sold primarily into export markets. Our international activities accounted for 13% of our sales by volume in 2007. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2007, approximately 94% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2007, production totaled 214.1 million tons and sales totaled 237.8 million tons. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could 51 be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. However, we expect to adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Eastern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations, and our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The principal business of the Western and Eastern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Geologically, Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits and Eastern operations mine bituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by a mix of surface and underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as steam coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a small portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. In the second half of 2006, through two separate transactions, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel), an independent coal company in Australia for a total acquisition price of US$1.51 billion, net of cash received, plus approximately $293.0 million in assumed debt. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for information on the financing of the Excel transaction. Assets acquired include three operating mines and three development stage mines, along with up to 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 6 to 8 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. During 2007, the Paso Diablo Mine contributed $21.2 million to segment Adjusted EBITDA in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and paid a dividend of $12.9 million. At December 31, 2007, our investment in Paso Diablo was $68.4 million. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from four of our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 4% of our total sales volume, but represents a larger share of our revenue, approximately 15% in 2007. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 92% of revenues in 2007, we generate revenues and additional cash flows from our Trading and Brokerage operations (7% of revenues), and other activities, including transactions utilizing our vast natural resource position (selling non core land holdings and mineral interests). We continue to pursue the development of coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. The projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. We own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. We are pursuing development of the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The plants, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. The EIA projects that the high price of oil will lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including Btu Conversion technologies, and that coal will increase its share as a fuel for electricity generation. We are exploring several Btu Conversion projects, which are designed to expand the 52 uses of coal through various technologies, and we are continuing to explore options particularly as they relate to Btu Conversion technologies such as coal to liquids and coal gasification. In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares for $99.8 million under this repurchase program. On October 31, 2007, we spun off portions of our Eastern U.S. Mining operations business segment to form Patriot. We distributed Patriot stock to our stockholders at a ratio of one share of Patriot stock for every 10 shares of Peabody stock held on the record date of October 22, 2007. Our results for all periods presented reflect Patriot as a discontinued operation. The spin off included eight company operated mines, two majority owned joint venture mines, and numerous contractor operated mines serviced by eight coal preparation facilities along with 1.2 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Prior to the spin off, we received necessary regulatory approvals including a private letter ruling on the tax free nature of the transaction from the Internal Revenue Service. Results of Operations The portions of the Eastern U.S. Mining operations business segment that were included in the spin off of Patriot have been classified as discontinued operations and are excluded from the operating results for all periods presented. See the description of the spin off in Part I, Item 1 Discontinued Operations. Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Summary Higher average sales prices across all U.S. regions and increased volumes, primarily from Australian Mining operations, contributed to an 11.4% increase in revenues to $4.57 billion compared to 2006. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.4% to $1.06 billion primarily on higher prices in the Western U.S. and increased results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues, higher commodity costs, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar. Also, negatively impacting Australian Mining results was lower metallurgical coal prices associated with annual contracts that began in April 2007. Income from continuing operations was $421.3 million in 2007, or $1.56 per diluted share, a decrease of 23.8% from 2006 income from continuing operations of $552.6 million, or $2.05 per diluted share. 53 Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2007 2006 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 161.4 160.5 0.9 0.6 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 30.9 30.4 0.5 1.6 % Australian Mining Operations 21.4 11.0 10.4 94.5 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 24.1 21.4 2.7 12.6 % Total tons sold 237.8 223.3 14.5 6.5 % Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 2,061,265 $ 1,703,445 $ 357,820 21.0 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 984,841 905,743 79,098 8.7 % Australian Mining Operations 1,161,093 843,194 317,899 37.7 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 320,692 652,029 (331,337 ) (50.8 )% Other 46,821 3,985 42,836 1074.9 % Total revenues $ 4,574,712 $ 4,108,396 $ 466,316 11.4 % In 2007, our total revenues were $4.57 billion, an increase of $466.3 million, or 11.4%, compared to the prior year, which resulted from sales price increases in all U.S. regions, most notably in our Powder River Basin operations and increased volumes from Australia. Volumes related to operations acquired in the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 10.9 million tons of the increase to tons sold. Partially offsetting sales price and volume increases was the continued shift towards trading contracts versus brokerage contracts in our Trading and Brokerage operations. Trading and Brokerage operations sales decreased during the year as the amount of brokerage business was reduced and replacement business was in the form of traded contracts. Contracts for trading activity are recorded at net margin in other revenues, whereas contracts for brokerage activity are recorded at gross sales price to revenues and operating costs. While the shift to trading contracts reduced total sales, there was no impact to Adjusted EBITDA. Overall, prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased due to a sales realization increase of approximately 29% for our premium Powder River Basin product and an average increase across all U.S. regions of 16%. In addition, Eastern U.S. Mining revenues increased due to higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants as those plants were idled for part of 2006. Offsetting this increase was lower average sales prices in our Australian Mining operations related to lower metallurgical contract pricing and a significant change in sales mix resulting in higher thermal export and domestic product sales. Volumes were unfavorably impacted at some of our Australian Mining operations as a result of damaged rails and further amplified port and rail congestion throughout the year, in addition to adverse weather events in the second quarter that affected production. 54 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $1.06 billion for the year ended 2007, compared with $1.03 billion in the prior year. Details were as follows: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 597,333 $ 473,074 $ 124,259 26.3 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 196,595 184,549 12,046 6.5 % Australian Mining Operations 159,473 278,411 (118,938 ) (42.7 )% Trading and Brokerage Operations 110,169 92,604 17,565 19.0 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,063,570 $ 1,028,638 $ 34,932 3.4 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $124.3 million, or 26.3%, during the year primarily related to the overall increase in average sales prices from our Powder River Basin operations. Partially offsetting higher average sales prices were higher costs associated with equipment repairs and maintenance and higher add on taxes and royalties driven by higher sales prices compared to the prior year, mine shutdown for maintenance in our Colorado region in December, higher fuel costs and adverse weather conditions in the Powder River Basin and capital project delays in the first half of the year. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 6.5%, compared to prior year as both volumes and prices per ton saw moderate increases. Results improved compared to prior year as benefits of higher volumes and sales prices were offset by higher costs for commodities, including fuel. The 2007 results were also positively impacted by higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel facilities of $12.5 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants for a portion of 2006. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased $118.9 million, or 42.7%, compared to prior year primarily due to approximately $31 million of higher costs resulting from the weakening U.S. dollar (higher costs of approximately $112 million were offset by hedging gains of $81 million); higher congestion related demurrage costs (approximately $50 million); lower pricing on annually repriced metallurgical coal contracts; and, rail and port congestion at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and the Port of Newcastle. Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal has been experiencing queues of over 41 vessels (approximately a 24 day load time) down from 50 vessels in the second quarter (approximately a 34 day delay). Partially offsetting these decreases were the full year contributions from our mines acquired in the Excel acquisition and a $6.3 million insurance recovery on a business interruption claim in the first half of 2007. Our Australian mines acquired in 2006 experienced shipping difficulties and damaged rail lines resulting from a storm late in the second quarter. The Port of Newcastle was closed for several days in June due to a storm, with up to 79 vessels in the queue (a 35 40 day wait). Queues at Newcastle have recently been reduced to 31 vessels (11 day wait). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.6 million from the prior year, as 2007 results reflected higher international trading gains, resulting from higher volumes and pricing due to expanded global trading activities, strong supply/demand fundamentals and tightened seaborne market conditions. 55 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,063,570 $ 1,028,638 $ 34,932 3.4 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (107,677 ) (127,682 ) 20,005 15.7 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (361,559 ) (294,270 ) (67,289 ) (22.9 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (25,610 ) (15,830 ) (9,780 ) (61.8 )% Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (234,983 ) (139,064 ) (95,919 ) (69.0 )% Interest income 7,094 11,309 (4,215 ) (37.3 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 340,835 $ 463,101 $ (122,266 ) (26.4 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests of $340.8 million for 2007 is $122.3 million, or 26.4%, lower than 2006 primarily due to higher interest expense and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the acquisition of Excel in late 2006. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint venture, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, Btu Conversion and resource management. The $20.0 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2007 compared to 2006 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $35.2 million. The 2007 activity included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves to the Prairie State equity partners. Our 2007 activity also included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of our coalbed methane and oil and gas rights in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for high Btu coal reserves located in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. In comparison, the 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million; Higher past mining obligation expenses of $15.5 million resulting from increased retiree healthcare costs due to higher than anticipated healthcare utilization by retirees, particularly related to prescription drugs; Higher selling and administrative expenses of $19.1 million during the year primarily resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and other corporate development initiatives; and Lower equity income of $6.8 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela), which primarily resulted from trucking issues experienced earlier in the year, a temporary shortage of explosives, and delays in receiving equipment, which impacted operations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $67.3 million primarily related to the addition of the Australian operations acquired in late 2006. Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs increased $95.9 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion in new debt issued or assumed as part of the Excel acquisition in the second half of 2006. 56 Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 340,835 $ 463,101 $ (122,266 ) (26.4 )% Income tax benefit 78,112 90,084 (11,972 ) (13.3 )% Minority interests 2,316 (611 ) 2,927 479.1 % Income from continuing operations 421,263 552,574 (131,311 ) (23.8 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations (156,978 ) 48,123 (205,101 ) (426.2 )% Net income $ 264,285 $ 600,697 $ (336,412 ) (56.0 )% Income from continuing operations decreased $131.3 million in 2007 compared to prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and a lower income tax benefit compared to 2006. The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended 2007 related primarily to a $56.0 million foreign currency impact on deferred taxes as a result of increases in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rates and $33.2 million lower tax reserves than in the prior year, partially offset by lower pre tax income, a $10.3 million increase in released valuation allowances, and $24.3 million of additional tax credits. Minority interests increased primarily from the absorption of losses in excess of the minority interest capital contribution at one of our mines, partially offset by lower earnings allocable to partners. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Summary Higher average sales prices and increased volumes in the Eastern U.S., Powder River Basin and Australian Mining operations, including the October 2006 acquisition of three mines in Australia, contributed to a 12.1% increase in revenues to $4.11 billion compared to 2005. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 17.8% to $1.03 billion primarily on growth in international volumes and higher sales prices from our Australian Mining operations and increased contributions from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by operational challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from rail performance in the Powder River Basin and port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues as well as mine closures in our Western U.S. Mining operations in late 2005. Net income was $600.7 million in 2006, or $2.23 per diluted share, an increase of 42.1% over 2005 net income of $422.7 million, or $1.58 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 160.5 154.3 6.2 4.0 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 30.4 28.7 1.7 5.9 % Australian Mining Operations 11.0 8.3 2.7 32.5 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 21.4 24.8 (3.4 ) (13.7 )% Total tons sold 223.3 216.1 7.2 3.3 % 57 Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 1,703,445 $ 1,611,587 $ 91,858 5.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 905,743 760,404 145,339 19.1 % Australian Mining Operations 843,194 598,085 245,109 41.0 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 652,029 679,176 (27,147 ) (4.0 )% Other 3,985 16,924 (12,939 ) (76.5 )% Total revenues $ 4,108,396 $ 3,666,176 $ 442,220 12.1 % In 2006, our total revenues were $4.11 billion, an increase of $442.2 million, or 12.1%, compared to prior year, which resulted from sales price increases in all regions, particularly in our Eastern and Australian operations and demand driven sales volume increases in the Powder River Basin, Midwest and Australian operations. Volumes related to the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 2.1 million tons of the increase to tons sold and approximately 43% of the increase to sales in Australia. Partially offsetting sales price increases were lower western regional sales due to the late 2005 mine closures in the Western U.S. Mining operations and lower brokerage volumes. Overall, prices and volumes in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased, mainly reflecting increases to sales prices of over $0.70 per ton and volumes of 12.7 million tons in the Powder River Basin. These increases at our Powder River Basin operations resulted from strong demand for the mines low sulfur products and improved rail conditions compared to 2005, when the region was dealing with major railroad maintenance. Despite rail performance improvements relative to 2005, constrained rail capacity continued to limit growth in the region in 2006. Also, affecting Western U.S. Mining revenues was lower production due to the cessation of mining operations at our Seneca and Black Mesa mines in late 2005 and unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues at our Twentymile Mine. Per ton sales prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased and sales volumes increased due primarily to our Gateway mine, which began operation in late 2005. Partially offset by the overall increase in 2006 total revenues was the customer idling of synfuel plants during 2006. Revenues from our Australian Mining operations were $245.1 million, or 41.0%, higher than in 2005, primarily due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, higher production at our underground mine following installation of a new longwall in the second quarter of 2006 and additional volumes from our newly acquired mines ($105.1 million). A higher per ton sales price reflected higher contract prices in 2006 for metallurgical coal as well as the slower realization of metallurgical coal price increases in 2005 when we operated under some lower priced carry over contracts from 2004 through most of the first nine months of 2005. Brokerage operations revenues decreased $27.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher sales prices and proceeds of $28.2 million from settlement of commitments by a third party coal producer following a brokerage contract restructuring. 58 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $1.03 billion for the year ended 2006 compared with $873.5 million in 2005. Details were as follows: Segment Adjusted EBITDA Increase to Segment Year Ended December 31, Adjusted EBITDA 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 473,074 $ 459,039 $ 14,035 3.1 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 184,549 168,793 15,756 9.3 % Australian Mining Operations 278,411 202,582 75,829 37.4 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 92,604 43,058 49,546 115.1 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,028,638 $ 873,472 $ 155,166 17.8 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $14.0 million, or 3.1%, during 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in sales volumes of 12.7 million tons at our Powder River Basin operations, which resulted from continued strong demand and improved rail performance relative to 2005. Western U.S. Mining operations sales price per ton increased moderately due to mix changes resulting from ceasing operations at our Black Mesa and Seneca mines. Western U.S. Mining operations cost increases were driven by higher fuel costs, an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes, and the timing of major repairs. In addition, we experienced unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues related to the new longwall system at our Twentymile Mine; however, a recovery of certain costs associated with the equipment difficulties lessened the impact of these issues on our 2006 results. The Western U.S. Mining operations were also negatively impacted in 2006 by the cessation of operations at the Black Mesa mine in late 2005. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $15.8 million, or 9.3%, compared to 2005 primarily due to higher volumes and sales prices, partially offset by higher costs per ton due to fuel costs, revenue based royalties and production taxes as well as higher costs associated with equipment and geologic issues. The 2006 results were also negatively impacted by lower revenues from synthetic fuel facilities of $10.1 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $75.8 million, or 37.4%, compared to 2005 primarily due to increased sales volumes following increased production from the second quarter installation of a new longwall system at our underground mine, higher metallurgical coal sales prices, and a $19.7 million contribution from our newly acquired mines. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $49.5 million from 2005, as 2006 results included proceeds from restructuring the brokerage contract mentioned above, improved brokerage margins and contributions from the newly established international trading operation, partially offset by lower U.S. trading results. 59 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,028,638 $ 873,472 $ 155,166 17.8 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (127,682 ) (165,623 ) 37,941 22.9 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (294,270 ) (253,788 ) (40,482 ) (16.0 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (15,830 ) (20,329 ) 4,499 22.1 % Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (139,064 ) (98,066 ) (40,998 ) (41.8 )% Interest income 11,309 9,088 2,221 24.4 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 463,101 $ 344,754 $ 118,347 34.3 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests of $463.1 million for 2006 is $118.3 million, or 34.3%, higher than 2005 primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, Btu Conversion and resource management. The $37.9 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2006 compared to 2005 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $9.1 million. The 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million. In comparison, activity in 2005 included a $31.1 million gain from the sale of our remaining 0.838 million units of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P., a $12.5 million gain from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and properties, and other gains on asset disposals of $0.8 million; Higher equity income of $8.0 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela; Lower selling and administrative expenses of $4.6 million primarily associated with lower performance based incentive costs, partially offset by increases to share based compensation expense as a result of the new requirement to expense stock options, costs to support corporate and international growth initiatives and costs for the development and installation of a new enterprise resource planning system. The lower costs associated with the performance based incentive plan related to a long term, executive incentive plan that is driven by shareholder return and reflected lower stock price appreciation in 2006 than in 2005; and Lower net expenses of $4.7 million related to the development of the Prairie State Energy Campus due to a higher rate of cost reimbursement from the partners in 2006. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $40.5 million in 2006 due to higher production volume, acquisitions and the impact of escalating capital costs and new capital, including two new longwall installations and new mine development. Also, 2005 depreciation, depletion and amortization was net of amortization of acquired contract liabilities. Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs increased $41.0 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion of debt issued or assumed in the second half of 2006 as part of the Excel acquisition. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more details of the debt issued. 60 Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 463,101 $ 344,754 $ 118,347 34.3 % Income tax benefit (provision) 90,084 (63,779 ) 153,863 241.2 % Minority interests (611 ) (2,472 ) 1,861 75.3 % Income from continuing operations 552,574 278,503 274,071 98.4 % Income from discontinued operations 48,123 144,150 (96,027 ) (66.6 )% Net income $ 600,697 $ 422,653 $ 178,044 42.1 % Income from continuing operations increased $274.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and an income tax benefit compared to an income tax provision in 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended 2006 related primarily to a reduction in tax reserves no longer required due to the finalization of various federal and state returns and expiration of applicable statute of limitations, and a reduction in a portion of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards. The reduction to the valuation allowance resulted from an increase to estimated future taxable income primarily resulting from long term contracts signed in late 2006 which increased our ability to realize these benefits in the future. Minority interests increased primarily as a result of acquiring an additional interest in a joint venture near the end of the first quarter of 2006. Outlook Events Impacting Near Term Operations Global coal markets continued to grow, driven by increased demand from growing and developing economies. The U.S. economy grew 2.2% for 2007 as reported by the U.S. Commerce Department, while Chinas economy grew 11.4% in 2007 as published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Growing constraints of global coal supplies ignited U.S. coal export interests beginning in the third quarter of 2007. By the start of 2008, global supply challenges became even greater. Flooding in Queensland, Australia in early 2008 is estimated to reduce seaborne coal supplies by more than 10 million metric tons; China issued a temporary moratorium on 2008 coal exports to secure supply for domestic needs, and South Africa temporarily shutdown coal production destined for export markets to conserve energy while reestablishing sufficient domestic coal supply. As a result, U.S. coal products are realizing expanded market reach resulting in higher published prices for all products. We expect to capitalize on the strong global markets primarily through production and sales of metallurgical and thermal coal from our Australian operations as well as through our U.S. and international coal trading activities. In Australia, we anticipate selling 23 to 25 million tons in 2008, as much as 17% higher than 2007s level. Of our anticipated shipments, we have nine to 10 million tons of coal production available to be priced in 2008, approximately two thirds of which is metallurgical coal. Our 2008 results will be affected by the final Australian coal price settlements. Our two primary shipping points, Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and Port of Newcastle, continue to experience lengthy vessel queues, extreme weather conditions impacting operations and the coal logistics chain, and transportation challenges, which could result in delayed shipments and demurrage charges. In the U.S., we anticipate higher volumes in 2008 versus 2007 from all the coal basins where we operate. Approximately 97% of our higher 2008 volumes are committed to existing customer contracts. In addition, the higher 2008 volume includes the mid year startup of a new mine in the Southwestern U.S. Our 2008 results will be impacted to the extent we complete ramp up activities on time and at expected capacity. Although we 61 currently expect to increase our shipment levels, our ability to reach targeted volumes is dependent upon the performance of the rail carriers. We expect strong improvements in U.S. and Australia operating results from higher prices and increased volumes, partly offset by some of the factors discussed above and escalation of key supply costs including approximately $150 million in higher energy related expenses and the effects of exchange rates. Long term Outlook Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as growth continues in the U.S., Asia and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. More than 100 gigawatts of new coal fueled electricity generating capacity is scheduled to come on line around the world between 2008 and 2010, and the EIA projects an additional 130 gigawatts of new U.S. coal fueled generation by 2030, including 9 gigawatts at coal to liquids plants and 45 gigawatts at integrated gasification combined cycle plants, which represents more than 500 million tons of additional coal demand. Coal to gas (CTG) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants represent a significant avenue for long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including CTL, and in the U.S. CTL technologies are receiving U.S. support from both political parties. China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. Demand for Powder River Basin coal remains strong, particularly for our ultra low sulfur products. The Powder River Basin represents more than half of our production. We control approximately 3.3 billion tons of proven and probable reserves in the Southern Powder River Basin, and we sold 139.8 million tons of coal from this region during 2007. We are targeting 2008 production of 220 to 240 million tons and total sales volume of 240 to 260 million tons, both of which include 23 to 25 million tons from Australia. As of December 31, 2007, our unpriced volumes for 2008 planned production included nine to 10 million Australian tons, two thirds of which is metallurgical coal, and five to seven million U.S. tons. Unpriced volumes for 2009 include 17 to 20 million Australian tons, approximately half of which is metallurgical coal, and 80 to 90 million U.S. tons. Management plans to aggressively control costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs, including a company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. In addition, historically low long term interest rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the United States or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, could result in electric generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. We continue to support clean coal technology development and voluntary initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation as a founding member of the FutureGen Alliance, through our commitment to the Australian COAL21 Fund, and through our participation in the Power Systems Development Facility, the PowerTree Carbon Company LLC, and the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate. In addition, we are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, the first near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) which is under development in China. 62 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities We have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006 resulted in each of these liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 being equal to the actuarially determined funded status of the plans. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $102.2 million, while payments were $71.6 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 11,202 $ (9,580 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 81,535 $ (70,842 ) 63 Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 1,076 $ (1,913 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (35,166 ) $ 41,399 Total (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.92 years at December 31, 2007. Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $25.6 million, and payments totaled $10.2 million. See detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Additional details regarding the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in Note 12. Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the 64 financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 95% of our revenue in 2007 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of coal supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal, freight and emissions allowances, both in over the counter markets and on exchanges. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal, freight and emission allowance positions from the over the counter market. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Published settlement prices are used to value our exchange based positions. As of December 31, 2007, 97% of the contracts in our trading portfolio were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials. As of December 31, 2007, 58% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2008 and 99% within 24 months. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Exploration and Drilling Costs Exploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Advance Stripping Costs Pre production: At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre production box cut to remove overburden (i.e., advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (i.e., advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices. Post production: Advance stripping costs related to post production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, we expense such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment. 65 Business Combinations We account for our business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment, and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which we adopted using the modified prospective option on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123(R), share based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award. We utilize restricted stock, nonqualified stock options, performance units, and an employee stock purchase plan as part of our share based compensation program. Determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions, including items such as expected term, risk free rate and expected volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including sales of our accounts receivable through our securitization program. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as planned acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends, among other things, are subject to limitations imposed by our Senior Notes and Debenture covenants. We expect to fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $447.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of $144.2 million compared to $591.4 million provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to lower profitability from our operations. Net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations of $130.8 million was primarily used to fund the regions net operating loss and for cash costs of the spin off. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $541.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $2.06 billion used in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to the acquisition of Excel of $1.51 billion, net of cash acquired, in 2006 and higher proceeds of $90.2 million from disposals of assets in 2007. Partially offsetting these items was higher capital spending of $72.9 million. Capital expenditures in 2007 included mine development at our recently acquired Australian mines, the completion of an in pit conveyor system, and coal blending and loadout facility at one of our Western U.S. mines and the purchase of coal reserves and surface lands in the Illinois Basin. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was $33.6 million and was used for pre spin capital costs for Patriot. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $44.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $1.41 billion provided in 2006. During 2007, we repaid $37.9 million of our Term Loan and purchased in the open market $13.8 million face value of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. We also made the final principal payment of $59.5 million on our 5% Subordinated Note. Our Revolving Credit Facility balance increased to $97.7 million as it was utilized to fund cash contributions to 66 Patriot at the spin off. In 2006, we issued net borrowings of $1.74 billion, which we utilized to fund the $1.51 billion Excel acquisition, the repayment of Excels bank facility and a portion of its outstanding bonds, and other corporate purposes. The net issuance of debt related to the Excel acquisition was partially offset in 2006 by repurchases of $7.7 million of our 5.875% Senior Notes in the open market, scheduled debt repayments of $11.1 million on our 5% Subordinated Note and other notes payable, and $99.8 million for the repurchase of common stock. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations of $67.0 million was primarily cash provided to Patriot at spin off to fund their working capital needs. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 consisted of the following: December 31, 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 509,084 $ 547,000 Revolving Credit Facility 97,700 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 732,500 732,500 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 650,000 650,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 246,965 246,897 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 218,090 231,845 5.0% Subordinated Note 59,504 6.84% Series C Bonds due 2016 43,000 43,000 6.34% Series B Bonds due 2014 21,000 21,000 6.84% Series A Bonds due 2014 10,000 10,000 Capital lease obligations 92,186 96,869 Fair value of interest rate swaps 1,604 (13,784 ) Other 971 2,201 Total $ 3,273,100 $ 3,277,032 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2006, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a $2.75 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and which amended and restated in full our then existing $1.35 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. The Term Loan Facility, which was fully drawn in October 2006 in connection with the Excel acquisition was paid down in December 2006 ($403.0 million), from a portion of the net proceeds from the Debentures. In conjunction with the establishment of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we incurred $8.6 million in financing costs, of which $5.6 million related to the Revolving Credit Facility and $3.0 million related to the Term Loan Facility. These debt issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over five years, the term of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third 67 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Currently, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus 0.75%, which at December 31, 2007 was 5.4%. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The new facility is less restrictive with respect to limitations on our dividend payments, capital expenditures, asset sales or stock repurchases. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2007, we had $97.7 million borrowings and $413.5 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility is primarily used for standby letters of credit and short term working capital needs. The remaining available borrowing capacity ($1.29 billion as of December 31, 2007) can be used to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs, including additional standby letters of credit. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures as of December 31, 2007. Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures On December 20, 2006, we issued $732.5 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (the Debentures). Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $715.0 million and were used to repay indebtedness under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. The Debentures pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.75% per year. We may elect to, and if and to the extent that a mandatory trigger event (as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures) has occurred and is continuing will be required to, defer interest payments on the Debentures. After five years of deferral at our option, or upon the occurrence of a mandatory trigger event, we generally must sell warrants or preferred stock with specified characteristics and use the funds from that sale to pay deferred interest, subject to certain limitations. In no event may we defer payments of interest on the Debentures for more than 10 years. The Debentures are convertible at any time on or prior to December 15, 2036 if any of the following conditions occur: (i) our closing common stock price exceeds 140% of the then applicable conversion price for the Debentures (currently $81.83 per share) for at least 20 of the final 30 trading days in any quarter; (ii) a notice of redemption is issued with respect to the Debentures; (iii) a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures; (iv) satisfaction of certain trading price conditions; and (v) other specified corporate transactions described in the indenture governing the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures are convertible at any time after December 15, 2036 to December 15, 2041, the scheduled maturity date. In the case of conversion following a notice of redemption or upon a non stock change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures, holders may convert their Debentures into cash in the amount of the principal amount of their Debentures and shares of our common stock for any conversion value in excess of the principal amount. In all other conversion circumstances, holders will receive perpetual preferred stock (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements) with a liquidation preference equal to the principal amount of their Debentures, and any conversion value in excess of the principal amount will be settled with our common stock. As a result of the Patriot spin off, the conversion rate was adjusted to 17.1078 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures effective November 23, 2007. This adjusted conversion rate represents a conversion price of approximately $58.45. The Debentures are unsecured obligations, ranking junior to all existing and future senior and subordinated debt (excluding trade accounts payable or accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business) except for any future debt that ranks equal to or junior to the Debentures. The Debentures will rank equal in right of payment with our obligations to trade creditors. Substantially, all of our existing indebtedness is senior to the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness of 68 our subsidiaries. The indenture governing the Debentures places no limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that we or any of our subsidiaries may incur (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Debentures). 7.375% Senior Notes Due November 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes Due November 2026 On October 12, 2006, we completed a $650.0 million offering of 7.375% 10 year Senior Notes due 2016 and $250 million of 7.875% 20 year Senior Notes due 2026. The notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness; equally in right of payment with any senior indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and effectively junior to all the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and commenced on May 1, 2007. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors, as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions. The notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make whole premium, if applicable, and any accrued unpaid interest to the redemption date. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, were $886.1 million. 6.875% Senior Notes Due March 2013 On March 21, 2003, we issued $650.0 million of 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, pay dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and investments, create liens, sell assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The notes are redeemable prior to March 15, 2008, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium (as defined in the indenture) and on or after March 15, 2008, at fixed redemption prices as set forth in the indenture. 5.875% Senior Notes Due March 2016 On March 23, 2004, we completed an offering of $250.0 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due March 2016. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and commenced on April 15, 2004. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, pay dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and investments, create liens, sell assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The notes are redeemable prior to April 15, 2009, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium (as defined in the indenture) and on or after April 15, 2009, at fixed redemption prices as set forth in the indenture. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, were $244.7 million. Series Bonds As of December 31, 2007, we had $74.0 million in Series Bonds outstanding, which were assumed as part of the Excel acquisition. The 6.84% Series A Bonds have a balloon maturity in December 2014. The 6.34% Series B Bonds mature in December 2014 and are payable in installments beginning December 2008. The 6.84% Series C Bonds mature in December 2016 and are payable in installments beginning December 2012. Interest payments are scheduled to occur in June and December of each year. 69 Interest Rate Swaps As of December 31, 2007, we had entered into a series of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of $120.0 million. Under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate of 6.875% and pay a weighted average floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%, which resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15. The swaps have been designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. We have also entered into another series of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of $100.0 million. Under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate of 5.875% and pay a weighted average floating rate of LIBOR plus 0.25%, which resets each April 15 and October 15. This series of swaps has been designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. In conjunction with the Term Loan Facility, we have a floating to fixed interest rate swap in place for a notional principal amount of $120.0 million. Under the terms of this swap we receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.0% and pay a fixed rate of 6.25%. This interest rate swap was designated as a hedge of the variable interest payments on the Term Loan under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Because the critical terms of the swaps and the respective debt instruments they hedge coincide, there was no hedge ineffectiveness recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 there was an unrealized loss related to the cash flow hedge of $6.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007, there was a net unrealized gain on the fair value hedges of $1.6 million. At December 31, 2006, the net unrealized loss on the fair value hedges was $13.8 million. The fair value hedge is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying value of the Senior Notes (see table above). Third party Security Ratings The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB rating and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on our Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B rating and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement On July 28, 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we can file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. The Debentures, 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Excel Transaction In October 2006, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel) for US$1.54 billion in cash plus assumed debt of US$293.0 million, less US$30.0 million of cash acquired in the transaction. This acquisition was financed with borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and Senior Notes due 2016 and 2026 (see Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the financing of the Excel acquisition). The Excel acquisition included three operating mines and three development stage mines (all of which are 70 operating as of December 31, 2007), with up to 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. The results of operations of Excel are included in our Australian Mining Operations segment from October 2006. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Excel acquisition). Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,781,312 $ 344,324 $ 471,852 $ 825,632 $ 4,139,504 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 116,861 17,349 34,258 30,234 35,020 Operating lease obligations 359,045 85,356 120,218 71,759 81,712 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 168,923 168,923 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 383,416 187,946 139,564 12,777 43,129 Other long term liabilities(2) 1,302,039 112,418 215,443 210,275 763,903 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,111,596 $ 916,316 $ 981,335 $ 1,150,677 $ 5,063,268 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2007, we had $67.8 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $301.6 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next three years. Total capital expenditures for 2008 are expected to range from $350 million to $400 million, excluding federal coal reserve lease payments, and relate to replacement, improvement, or expansion of existing mines, particularly in Australia, the El Segundo mine development in New Mexico, and growth initiatives such as increasing capacity in the Powder River Basin. Capital expenditures were funded primarily through operating cash flow. Our subsidiary, Peabody Pacific, has committed to pay up to a maximum of A$0.20/tonne (approximately US$0.15/tonne) of coal sales for a period of five years to the Australian COAL21 Fund. The COAL21 Fund is a voluntary coal industry fund to support clean coal technology demonstration projects and research in Australia. All major coal companies in Australia have committed to this fund. The commitment to pay started on April 1, 2007 with a levy of A$0.10/tonne of coal sales. This levy rose to A$0.20/tonne on July 1, 2007. We do not expect any of the $152.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. 71 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2007: Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self Bonding $ 640.6 $ $ $ $ $ 640.6 Surety Bonds 418.3 73.0 31.2 16.7 539.2 Letters of Credit 1.6 102.7 41.4 267.9 413.6 $ 1,060.5 $ 73.0 $ 133.9 $ 41.4 $ 284.6 $ 1,593.4 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the PBGC and collateral for surety companies. As part of arrangements through which we obtain exclusive sales representation agreements with small coal mining companies (the Counterparties), we issued financial guarantees on behalf of the Counterparties. These guarantees facilitate the Counterparties efforts to obtain bonding or financing. In 2007, we purchased approximately 345 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands in the Illinois Basin. In conjunction with this purchase, we agreed to provide up to $64.8 million of reclamation and bonding commitments to a third party coal company. We have recognized the full amount of these commitments as a liability as of December 31, 2007. The non cash portion of this transaction was excluded from the investing section of the statement of cash flows. In the event of default, the terms of our guarantees provide for multiple recourse options, including the ability to assume the loans and procure title and use of the equipment purchased through the loans. If default occurs, we have the ability and intent to exercise our recourse options, so the liability associated with the guarantee has been valued at zero. The aggregate amount guaranteed for all such Counterparties was $8.8 million at December 31, 2007. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of our guarantees. As part of the Patriot spin off, we agreed to maintain in force several letters of credit that secured Patriot obligations for certain employee benefits and workers compensation obligations. These letters of credit are to be released upon Patriot satisfying the beneficiaries with alternate letters of credit or insurance, which is expected to occur in 2008. If Patriot is unable to satisfy the primary beneficiaries by June 30, 2011, they are then required to provide directly to us a letter of credit in the amount of the remaining obligation. As of December 31, 2007, the amount of letters of credit securing Patriot obligations was $136.8 million. Under our accounts receivable securitization program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $11.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The securitization program is scheduled to expire in September 2009. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the 72 consolidated balance sheets. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $275.0 million and $219.2 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounts receivable securitization). The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2007: Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Over Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 1,800,000 $ $ $ 1,800,000 $ Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48). This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, and as a result, reported $135.0 million of net unrecognized tax benefits ($144.0 million gross) in our consolidated financial statements. Due to the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset for NOL carryforwards as of January 1, 2007, none of the $135.0 million required an adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158). For fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, SFAS No. 158 required recognition of the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans (an asset for overfunded status or a liability for underfunded status) in a companys balance sheet. In addition, the standard required recognition of actuarial gains and losses, prior service cost, and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS No. 106) when determining a plans funded status, with a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We adopted SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006, and as a result, recorded a noncurrent liability of $376.1 million, which reflected the total underfunded status of the pension, retiree healthcare and workers compensation plans. The funded status of each plan was measured as the difference between the fair value of the assets and the projected benefit obligation (the funded status). SFAS No. 158 did not impact net income. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and therefore does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008 for the Company). In February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS No. 157 to exclude leasing transactions and to delay the effective date by one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 73 provides all entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008 for the Company). We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for (1) noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and (2) the loss of control of subsidiaries. SFAS No. 160 requires noncontrolling interests (minority interests) to be reported as a separate component of equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. SFAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for the Company). Early adoption is not allowed. We are in the process of determining the effect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R) significantly changes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This statement also provides guidance for the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination and for determination of required disclosures that will enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for the Company). We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal, freight and emissions allowance trading, fuel, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal, freight and emissions allowance trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading fuel, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter, exchange based and direct trading of coal, freight and emission allowances (collectively coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the 74 potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both swaps and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes 5 and 15 day holding periods, as applicable, and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our value at risk measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the combined actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $1.2 million, $13.7 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. Our value at risk increased over the prior year due to greater price volatility in the coal markets, particularly in the international markets into which we have recently expanded. As of December 31, 2007, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Percentage Year of Expiration of Portfolio 2008 58 % 2009 41 % 2010 0 % 2011 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. In general, increases in coal price volatility and our own trading activity resulted in greater exposure to our coal trading counterparties during the year. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. 75 Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2008 targets hedging at least approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2007, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling A$2.03 billion of which A$1.08 billion, A$556.7 million, and A$388.8 million will expire in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in Operating costs and expenses due to a $0.01 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $12 million for 2008. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $1.6 million in 2008. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.57 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $707.2 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $7.1 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $0.3 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 94% and 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we had 5 to 10 million tons of expected U.S. production unpriced for 2008. We had 9 to 10 million tons remaining to be priced for 2008 in Australia at December 31, 2007. We have approximately 80 to 90 million tons of expected U.S. production unpriced for 2009, with an additional 17 to 20 million tons of expected Australia coal production unpriced for 2009. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. As of December 31, 2007, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel and explosives. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts were 114.8 million gallons of crude oil scheduled to expire through 2010. We expect to consume 125 to 130 million gallons of fuel next year. A one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $2.4 million. Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts, scheduled to expire through 2010, were 5.7 mmbtu of natural gas. We expect to consume 315,000 to 325,000 tons of explosives per year. Through our natural gas hedge contracts, we have fixed prices for approximately 49% of our anticipated explosives requirements for 2008. Based on our expected usage, a change in natural gas prices of ten cents per mmbtu (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our operating costs of approximately $0.6 million per year.

Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 50 Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows (unaudited): Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations $ 421,263 $ 552,574 $ 278,503 $ 180,957 $ 91,443 Income tax provision (benefit) (78,112 ) (90,084 ) 63,779 281 (8,017 ) Depreciation, depletion and amortization 361,559 294,270 253,788 211,630 180,262 Asset retirement obligation expense 25,610 15,830 20,329 15,125 13,226 Interest expense 235,236 137,668 98,066 89,052 90,754 Early debt extinguishment costs (253 ) 1,396 1,751 53,513 Interest income (7,094 ) (11,309 ) (9,088 ) (3,999 ) (2,126 ) Minority interests (2,316 ) 611 2,472 1,007 3,035 Adjusted EBITDA $ 955,893 $ 900,956 $ 707,849 $ 495,804 $ 422,090 Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 31 coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions, except Appalachia, and international interests in Australia and Venezuela. In 2007, we sold 237.8 million tons of coal. Our U.S. sales represented 19% of all U.S. coal sales and were approximately 80% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. United States coal demand was approximately 1.1 billion tons in 2007, based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Coals predominate use is for baseload electricity requirements. For the 12 months ended November 2007, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 50%, a share that the EIA projects will grow to 55% by 2030. EIA projects an additional 130 gigawatts of new U.S. coal fueled generation by 2030, including 9 gigawatts at coal to liquids plants and 45 gigawatts at integrated gasification combined cycle plants, which represents more than 500 million tons of additional coal demand. Domestic coal consumption is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.8% from 2007 through 2030 when U.S. coal demand is forecasted to reach 1.7 billion tons. Coal production located west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth as Western production increases to an estimated 65% share of total production in 2030 versus 58% in 2007. Globally, we believe that coal demand is driven by electricity generation (65%) and industrial use (31%), including steel making. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates coals share of total world energy consumption is projected to increase from 25% in 2005 to 28% through 2030, and in the electric power sector, its share is estimated to rise from 43% in 2004 to 45% in 2030. More than 80% of the growth in global coal demand is expected to come from China and India. These two countries comprise approximately 45% of global coal use, which is projected by IEA to grow to 80% by 2030. China alone added an estimated 96 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation in 2007, representing more than 300 million tons of annual coal use. Coal demand in India is forecasted to nearly triple by 2030. In total, global coal consumption is expected to grow 73%, or more than 4 billion tons by 2030. Our primary U.S. customers are utilities, which accounted for 85% of our sales in 2007. Our international production is sold primarily into export markets. Our international activities accounted for 13% of our sales by volume in 2007. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2007, approximately 94% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2007, production totaled 214.1 million tons and sales totaled 237.8 million tons. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could 51 be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. However, we expect to adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Eastern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations, and our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The principal business of the Western and Eastern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Geologically, Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits and Eastern operations mine bituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by a mix of surface and underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as steam coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a small portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. In the second half of 2006, through two separate transactions, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel), an independent coal company in Australia for a total acquisition price of US$1.51 billion, net of cash received, plus approximately $293.0 million in assumed debt. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for information on the financing of the Excel transaction. Assets acquired include three operating mines and three development stage mines, along with up to 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 6 to 8 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. During 2007, the Paso Diablo Mine contributed $21.2 million to segment Adjusted EBITDA in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and paid a dividend of $12.9 million. At December 31, 2007, our investment in Paso Diablo was $68.4 million. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from four of our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 4% of our total sales volume, but represents a larger share of our revenue, approximately 15% in 2007. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 92% of revenues in 2007, we generate revenues and additional cash flows from our Trading and Brokerage operations (7% of revenues), and other activities, including transactions utilizing our vast natural resource position (selling non core land holdings and mineral interests). We continue to pursue the development of coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. The projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. We own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. We are pursuing development of the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The plants, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. The EIA projects that the high price of oil will lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including Btu Conversion technologies, and that coal will increase its share as a fuel for electricity generation. We are exploring several Btu Conversion projects, which are designed to expand the 52 uses of coal through various technologies, and we are continuing to explore options particularly as they relate to Btu Conversion technologies such as coal to liquids and coal gasification. In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares for $99.8 million under this repurchase program. On October 31, 2007, we spun off portions of our Eastern U.S. Mining operations business segment to form Patriot. We distributed Patriot stock to our stockholders at a ratio of one share of Patriot stock for every 10 shares of Peabody stock held on the record date of October 22, 2007. Our results for all periods presented reflect Patriot as a discontinued operation. The spin off included eight company operated mines, two majority owned joint venture mines, and numerous contractor operated mines serviced by eight coal preparation facilities along with 1.2 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Prior to the spin off, we received necessary regulatory approvals including a private letter ruling on the tax free nature of the transaction from the Internal Revenue Service. Results of Operations The portions of the Eastern U.S. Mining operations business segment that were included in the spin off of Patriot have been classified as discontinued operations and are excluded from the operating results for all periods presented. See the description of the spin off in Part I, Item 1 Discontinued Operations. Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Summary Higher average sales prices across all U.S. regions and increased volumes, primarily from Australian Mining operations, contributed to an 11.4% increase in revenues to $4.57 billion compared to 2006. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.4% to $1.06 billion primarily on higher prices in the Western U.S. and increased results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues, higher commodity costs, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar. Also, negatively impacting Australian Mining results was lower metallurgical coal prices associated with annual contracts that began in April 2007. Income from continuing operations was $421.3 million in 2007, or $1.56 per diluted share, a decrease of 23.8% from 2006 income from continuing operations of $552.6 million, or $2.05 per diluted share. 53 Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2007 2006 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 161.4 160.5 0.9 0.6 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 30.9 30.4 0.5 1.6 % Australian Mining Operations 21.4 11.0 10.4 94.5 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 24.1 21.4 2.7 12.6 % Total tons sold 237.8 223.3 14.5 6.5 % Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 2,061,265 $ 1,703,445 $ 357,820 21.0 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 984,841 905,743 79,098 8.7 % Australian Mining Operations 1,161,093 843,194 317,899 37.7 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 320,692 652,029 (331,337 ) (50.8 )% Other 46,821 3,985 42,836 1074.9 % Total revenues $ 4,574,712 $ 4,108,396 $ 466,316 11.4 % In 2007, our total revenues were $4.57 billion, an increase of $466.3 million, or 11.4%, compared to the prior year, which resulted from sales price increases in all U.S. regions, most notably in our Powder River Basin operations and increased volumes from Australia. Volumes related to operations acquired in the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 10.9 million tons of the increase to tons sold. Partially offsetting sales price and volume increases was the continued shift towards trading contracts versus brokerage contracts in our Trading and Brokerage operations. Trading and Brokerage operations sales decreased during the year as the amount of brokerage business was reduced and replacement business was in the form of traded contracts. Contracts for trading activity are recorded at net margin in other revenues, whereas contracts for brokerage activity are recorded at gross sales price to revenues and operating costs. While the shift to trading contracts reduced total sales, there was no impact to Adjusted EBITDA. Overall, prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased due to a sales realization increase of approximately 29% for our premium Powder River Basin product and an average increase across all U.S. regions of 16%. In addition, Eastern U.S. Mining revenues increased due to higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants as those plants were idled for part of 2006. Offsetting this increase was lower average sales prices in our Australian Mining operations related to lower metallurgical contract pricing and a significant change in sales mix resulting in higher thermal export and domestic product sales. Volumes were unfavorably impacted at some of our Australian Mining operations as a result of damaged rails and further amplified port and rail congestion throughout the year, in addition to adverse weather events in the second quarter that affected production. 54 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $1.06 billion for the year ended 2007, compared with $1.03 billion in the prior year. Details were as follows: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 597,333 $ 473,074 $ 124,259 26.3 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 196,595 184,549 12,046 6.5 % Australian Mining Operations 159,473 278,411 (118,938 ) (42.7 )% Trading and Brokerage Operations 110,169 92,604 17,565 19.0 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,063,570 $ 1,028,638 $ 34,932 3.4 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $124.3 million, or 26.3%, during the year primarily related to the overall increase in average sales prices from our Powder River Basin operations. Partially offsetting higher average sales prices were higher costs associated with equipment repairs and maintenance and higher add on taxes and royalties driven by higher sales prices compared to the prior year, mine shutdown for maintenance in our Colorado region in December, higher fuel costs and adverse weather conditions in the Powder River Basin and capital project delays in the first half of the year. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 6.5%, compared to prior year as both volumes and prices per ton saw moderate increases. Results improved compared to prior year as benefits of higher volumes and sales prices were offset by higher costs for commodities, including fuel. The 2007 results were also positively impacted by higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel facilities of $12.5 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants for a portion of 2006. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased $118.9 million, or 42.7%, compared to prior year primarily due to approximately $31 million of higher costs resulting from the weakening U.S. dollar (higher costs of approximately $112 million were offset by hedging gains of $81 million); higher congestion related demurrage costs (approximately $50 million); lower pricing on annually repriced metallurgical coal contracts; and, rail and port congestion at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and the Port of Newcastle. Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal has been experiencing queues of over 41 vessels (approximately a 24 day load time) down from 50 vessels in the second quarter (approximately a 34 day delay). Partially offsetting these decreases were the full year contributions from our mines acquired in the Excel acquisition and a $6.3 million insurance recovery on a business interruption claim in the first half of 2007. Our Australian mines acquired in 2006 experienced shipping difficulties and damaged rail lines resulting from a storm late in the second quarter. The Port of Newcastle was closed for several days in June due to a storm, with up to 79 vessels in the queue (a 35 40 day wait). Queues at Newcastle have recently been reduced to 31 vessels (11 day wait). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.6 million from the prior year, as 2007 results reflected higher international trading gains, resulting from higher volumes and pricing due to expanded global trading activities, strong supply/demand fundamentals and tightened seaborne market conditions. 55 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,063,570 $ 1,028,638 $ 34,932 3.4 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (107,677 ) (127,682 ) 20,005 15.7 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (361,559 ) (294,270 ) (67,289 ) (22.9 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (25,610 ) (15,830 ) (9,780 ) (61.8 )% Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (234,983 ) (139,064 ) (95,919 ) (69.0 )% Interest income 7,094 11,309 (4,215 ) (37.3 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 340,835 $ 463,101 $ (122,266 ) (26.4 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests of $340.8 million for 2007 is $122.3 million, or 26.4%, lower than 2006 primarily due to higher interest expense and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the acquisition of Excel in late 2006. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint venture, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, Btu Conversion and resource management. The $20.0 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2007 compared to 2006 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $35.2 million. The 2007 activity included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves to the Prairie State equity partners. Our 2007 activity also included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of our coalbed methane and oil and gas rights in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for high Btu coal reserves located in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. In comparison, the 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million; Higher past mining obligation expenses of $15.5 million resulting from increased retiree healthcare costs due to higher than anticipated healthcare utilization by retirees, particularly related to prescription drugs; Higher selling and administrative expenses of $19.1 million during the year primarily resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and other corporate development initiatives; and Lower equity income of $6.8 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela), which primarily resulted from trucking issues experienced earlier in the year, a temporary shortage of explosives, and delays in receiving equipment, which impacted operations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $67.3 million primarily related to the addition of the Australian operations acquired in late 2006. Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs increased $95.9 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion in new debt issued or assumed as part of the Excel acquisition in the second half of 2006. 56 Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 340,835 $ 463,101 $ (122,266 ) (26.4 )% Income tax benefit 78,112 90,084 (11,972 ) (13.3 )% Minority interests 2,316 (611 ) 2,927 479.1 % Income from continuing operations 421,263 552,574 (131,311 ) (23.8 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations (156,978 ) 48,123 (205,101 ) (426.2 )% Net income $ 264,285 $ 600,697 $ (336,412 ) (56.0 )% Income from continuing operations decreased $131.3 million in 2007 compared to prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and a lower income tax benefit compared to 2006. The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended 2007 related primarily to a $56.0 million foreign currency impact on deferred taxes as a result of increases in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rates and $33.2 million lower tax reserves than in the prior year, partially offset by lower pre tax income, a $10.3 million increase in released valuation allowances, and $24.3 million of additional tax credits. Minority interests increased primarily from the absorption of losses in excess of the minority interest capital contribution at one of our mines, partially offset by lower earnings allocable to partners. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Summary Higher average sales prices and increased volumes in the Eastern U.S., Powder River Basin and Australian Mining operations, including the October 2006 acquisition of three mines in Australia, contributed to a 12.1% increase in revenues to $4.11 billion compared to 2005. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 17.8% to $1.03 billion primarily on growth in international volumes and higher sales prices from our Australian Mining operations and increased contributions from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by operational challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from rail performance in the Powder River Basin and port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues as well as mine closures in our Western U.S. Mining operations in late 2005. Net income was $600.7 million in 2006, or $2.23 per diluted share, an increase of 42.1% over 2005 net income of $422.7 million, or $1.58 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 160.5 154.3 6.2 4.0 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 30.4 28.7 1.7 5.9 % Australian Mining Operations 11.0 8.3 2.7 32.5 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 21.4 24.8 (3.4 ) (13.7 )% Total tons sold 223.3 216.1 7.2 3.3 % 57 Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 1,703,445 $ 1,611,587 $ 91,858 5.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 905,743 760,404 145,339 19.1 % Australian Mining Operations 843,194 598,085 245,109 41.0 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 652,029 679,176 (27,147 ) (4.0 )% Other 3,985 16,924 (12,939 ) (76.5 )% Total revenues $ 4,108,396 $ 3,666,176 $ 442,220 12.1 % In 2006, our total revenues were $4.11 billion, an increase of $442.2 million, or 12.1%, compared to prior year, which resulted from sales price increases in all regions, particularly in our Eastern and Australian operations and demand driven sales volume increases in the Powder River Basin, Midwest and Australian operations. Volumes related to the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 2.1 million tons of the increase to tons sold and approximately 43% of the increase to sales in Australia. Partially offsetting sales price increases were lower western regional sales due to the late 2005 mine closures in the Western U.S. Mining operations and lower brokerage volumes. Overall, prices and volumes in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased, mainly reflecting increases to sales prices of over $0.70 per ton and volumes of 12.7 million tons in the Powder River Basin. These increases at our Powder River Basin operations resulted from strong demand for the mines low sulfur products and improved rail conditions compared to 2005, when the region was dealing with major railroad maintenance. Despite rail performance improvements relative to 2005, constrained rail capacity continued to limit growth in the region in 2006. Also, affecting Western U.S. Mining revenues was lower production due to the cessation of mining operations at our Seneca and Black Mesa mines in late 2005 and unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues at our Twentymile Mine. Per ton sales prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased and sales volumes increased due primarily to our Gateway mine, which began operation in late 2005. Partially offset by the overall increase in 2006 total revenues was the customer idling of synfuel plants during 2006. Revenues from our Australian Mining operations were $245.1 million, or 41.0%, higher than in 2005, primarily due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, higher production at our underground mine following installation of a new longwall in the second quarter of 2006 and additional volumes from our newly acquired mines ($105.1 million). A higher per ton sales price reflected higher contract prices in 2006 for metallurgical coal as well as the slower realization of metallurgical coal price increases in 2005 when we operated under some lower priced carry over contracts from 2004 through most of the first nine months of 2005. Brokerage operations revenues decreased $27.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher sales prices and proceeds of $28.2 million from settlement of commitments by a third party coal producer following a brokerage contract restructuring. 58 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $1.03 billion for the year ended 2006 compared with $873.5 million in 2005. Details were as follows: Segment Adjusted EBITDA Increase to Segment Year Ended December 31, Adjusted EBITDA 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 473,074 $ 459,039 $ 14,035 3.1 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 184,549 168,793 15,756 9.3 % Australian Mining Operations 278,411 202,582 75,829 37.4 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 92,604 43,058 49,546 115.1 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,028,638 $ 873,472 $ 155,166 17.8 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $14.0 million, or 3.1%, during 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in sales volumes of 12.7 million tons at our Powder River Basin operations, which resulted from continued strong demand and improved rail performance relative to 2005. Western U.S. Mining operations sales price per ton increased moderately due to mix changes resulting from ceasing operations at our Black Mesa and Seneca mines. Western U.S. Mining operations cost increases were driven by higher fuel costs, an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes, and the timing of major repairs. In addition, we experienced unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues related to the new longwall system at our Twentymile Mine; however, a recovery of certain costs associated with the equipment difficulties lessened the impact of these issues on our 2006 results. The Western U.S. Mining operations were also negatively impacted in 2006 by the cessation of operations at the Black Mesa mine in late 2005. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $15.8 million, or 9.3%, compared to 2005 primarily due to higher volumes and sales prices, partially offset by higher costs per ton due to fuel costs, revenue based royalties and production taxes as well as higher costs associated with equipment and geologic issues. The 2006 results were also negatively impacted by lower revenues from synthetic fuel facilities of $10.1 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $75.8 million, or 37.4%, compared to 2005 primarily due to increased sales volumes following increased production from the second quarter installation of a new longwall system at our underground mine, higher metallurgical coal sales prices, and a $19.7 million contribution from our newly acquired mines. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $49.5 million from 2005, as 2006 results included proceeds from restructuring the brokerage contract mentioned above, improved brokerage margins and contributions from the newly established international trading operation, partially offset by lower U.S. trading results. 59 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,028,638 $ 873,472 $ 155,166 17.8 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (127,682 ) (165,623 ) 37,941 22.9 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (294,270 ) (253,788 ) (40,482 ) (16.0 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (15,830 ) (20,329 ) 4,499 22.1 % Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (139,064 ) (98,066 ) (40,998 ) (41.8 )% Interest income 11,309 9,088 2,221 24.4 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 463,101 $ 344,754 $ 118,347 34.3 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests of $463.1 million for 2006 is $118.3 million, or 34.3%, higher than 2005 primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, Btu Conversion and resource management. The $37.9 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2006 compared to 2005 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $9.1 million. The 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million. In comparison, activity in 2005 included a $31.1 million gain from the sale of our remaining 0.838 million units of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P., a $12.5 million gain from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and properties, and other gains on asset disposals of $0.8 million; Higher equity income of $8.0 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela; Lower selling and administrative expenses of $4.6 million primarily associated with lower performance based incentive costs, partially offset by increases to share based compensation expense as a result of the new requirement to expense stock options, costs to support corporate and international growth initiatives and costs for the development and installation of a new enterprise resource planning system. The lower costs associated with the performance based incentive plan related to a long term, executive incentive plan that is driven by shareholder return and reflected lower stock price appreciation in 2006 than in 2005; and Lower net expenses of $4.7 million related to the development of the Prairie State Energy Campus due to a higher rate of cost reimbursement from the partners in 2006. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $40.5 million in 2006 due to higher production volume, acquisitions and the impact of escalating capital costs and new capital, including two new longwall installations and new mine development. Also, 2005 depreciation, depletion and amortization was net of amortization of acquired contract liabilities. Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs increased $41.0 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion of debt issued or assumed in the second half of 2006 as part of the Excel acquisition. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more details of the debt issued. 60 Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 463,101 $ 344,754 $ 118,347 34.3 % Income tax benefit (provision) 90,084 (63,779 ) 153,863 241.2 % Minority interests (611 ) (2,472 ) 1,861 75.3 % Income from continuing operations 552,574 278,503 274,071 98.4 % Income from discontinued operations 48,123 144,150 (96,027 ) (66.6 )% Net income $ 600,697 $ 422,653 $ 178,044 42.1 % Income from continuing operations increased $274.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and an income tax benefit compared to an income tax provision in 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended 2006 related primarily to a reduction in tax reserves no longer required due to the finalization of various federal and state returns and expiration of applicable statute of limitations, and a reduction in a portion of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards. The reduction to the valuation allowance resulted from an increase to estimated future taxable income primarily resulting from long term contracts signed in late 2006 which increased our ability to realize these benefits in the future. Minority interests increased primarily as a result of acquiring an additional interest in a joint venture near the end of the first quarter of 2006. Outlook Events Impacting Near Term Operations Global coal markets continued to grow, driven by increased demand from growing and developing economies. The U.S. economy grew 2.2% for 2007 as reported by the U.S. Commerce Department, while Chinas economy grew 11.4% in 2007 as published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Growing constraints of global coal supplies ignited U.S. coal export interests beginning in the third quarter of 2007. By the start of 2008, global supply challenges became even greater. Flooding in Queensland, Australia in early 2008 is estimated to reduce seaborne coal supplies by more than 10 million metric tons; China issued a temporary moratorium on 2008 coal exports to secure supply for domestic needs, and South Africa temporarily shutdown coal production destined for export markets to conserve energy while reestablishing sufficient domestic coal supply. As a result, U.S. coal products are realizing expanded market reach resulting in higher published prices for all products. We expect to capitalize on the strong global markets primarily through production and sales of metallurgical and thermal coal from our Australian operations as well as through our U.S. and international coal trading activities. In Australia, we anticipate selling 23 to 25 million tons in 2008, as much as 17% higher than 2007s level. Of our anticipated shipments, we have nine to 10 million tons of coal production available to be priced in 2008, approximately two thirds of which is metallurgical coal. Our 2008 results will be affected by the final Australian coal price settlements. Our two primary shipping points, Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and Port of Newcastle, continue to experience lengthy vessel queues, extreme weather conditions impacting operations and the coal logistics chain, and transportation challenges, which could result in delayed shipments and demurrage charges. In the U.S., we anticipate higher volumes in 2008 versus 2007 from all the coal basins where we operate. Approximately 97% of our higher 2008 volumes are committed to existing customer contracts. In addition, the higher 2008 volume includes the mid year startup of a new mine in the Southwestern U.S. Our 2008 results will be impacted to the extent we complete ramp up activities on time and at expected capacity. Although we 61 currently expect to increase our shipment levels, our ability to reach targeted volumes is dependent upon the performance of the rail carriers. We expect strong improvements in U.S. and Australia operating results from higher prices and increased volumes, partly offset by some of the factors discussed above and escalation of key supply costs including approximately $150 million in higher energy related expenses and the effects of exchange rates. Long term Outlook Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as growth continues in the U.S., Asia and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. More than 100 gigawatts of new coal fueled electricity generating capacity is scheduled to come on line around the world between 2008 and 2010, and the EIA projects an additional 130 gigawatts of new U.S. coal fueled generation by 2030, including 9 gigawatts at coal to liquids plants and 45 gigawatts at integrated gasification combined cycle plants, which represents more than 500 million tons of additional coal demand. Coal to gas (CTG) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants represent a significant avenue for long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including CTL, and in the U.S. CTL technologies are receiving U.S. support from both political parties. China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. Demand for Powder River Basin coal remains strong, particularly for our ultra low sulfur products. The Powder River Basin represents more than half of our production. We control approximately 3.3 billion tons of proven and probable reserves in the Southern Powder River Basin, and we sold 139.8 million tons of coal from this region during 2007. We are targeting 2008 production of 220 to 240 million tons and total sales volume of 240 to 260 million tons, both of which include 23 to 25 million tons from Australia. As of December 31, 2007, our unpriced volumes for 2008 planned production included nine to 10 million Australian tons, two thirds of which is metallurgical coal, and five to seven million U.S. tons. Unpriced volumes for 2009 include 17 to 20 million Australian tons, approximately half of which is metallurgical coal, and 80 to 90 million U.S. tons. Management plans to aggressively control costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs, including a company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. In addition, historically low long term interest rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the United States or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, could result in electric generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. We continue to support clean coal technology development and voluntary initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation as a founding member of the FutureGen Alliance, through our commitment to the Australian COAL21 Fund, and through our participation in the Power Systems Development Facility, the PowerTree Carbon Company LLC, and the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate. In addition, we are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, the first near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) which is under development in China. 62 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities We have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006 resulted in each of these liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 being equal to the actuarially determined funded status of the plans. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $102.2 million, while payments were $71.6 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 11,202 $ (9,580 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 81,535 $ (70,842 ) 63 Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 1,076 $ (1,913 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (35,166 ) $ 41,399 Total (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.92 years at December 31, 2007. Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $25.6 million, and payments totaled $10.2 million. See detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Additional details regarding the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in Note 12. Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the 64 financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 95% of our revenue in 2007 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of coal supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal, freight and emissions allowances, both in over the counter markets and on exchanges. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal, freight and emission allowance positions from the over the counter market. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Published settlement prices are used to value our exchange based positions. As of December 31, 2007, 97% of the contracts in our trading portfolio were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials. As of December 31, 2007, 58% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2008 and 99% within 24 months. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Exploration and Drilling Costs Exploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Advance Stripping Costs Pre production: At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre production box cut to remove overburden (i.e., advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (i.e., advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices. Post production: Advance stripping costs related to post production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, we expense such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment. 65 Business Combinations We account for our business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment, and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which we adopted using the modified prospective option on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123(R), share based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award. We utilize restricted stock, nonqualified stock options, performance units, and an employee stock purchase plan as part of our share based compensation program. Determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions, including items such as expected term, risk free rate and expected volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including sales of our accounts receivable through our securitization program. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as planned acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends, among other things, are subject to limitations imposed by our Senior Notes and Debenture covenants. We expect to fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $447.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of $144.2 million compared to $591.4 million provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to lower profitability from our operations. Net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations of $130.8 million was primarily used to fund the regions net operating loss and for cash costs of the spin off. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $541.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $2.06 billion used in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to the acquisition of Excel of $1.51 billion, net of cash acquired, in 2006 and higher proceeds of $90.2 million from disposals of assets in 2007. Partially offsetting these items was higher capital spending of $72.9 million. Capital expenditures in 2007 included mine development at our recently acquired Australian mines, the completion of an in pit conveyor system, and coal blending and loadout facility at one of our Western U.S. mines and the purchase of coal reserves and surface lands in the Illinois Basin. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was $33.6 million and was used for pre spin capital costs for Patriot. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $44.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $1.41 billion provided in 2006. During 2007, we repaid $37.9 million of our Term Loan and purchased in the open market $13.8 million face value of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. We also made the final principal payment of $59.5 million on our 5% Subordinated Note. Our Revolving Credit Facility balance increased to $97.7 million as it was utilized to fund cash contributions to 66 Patriot at the spin off. In 2006, we issued net borrowings of $1.74 billion, which we utilized to fund the $1.51 billion Excel acquisition, the repayment of Excels bank facility and a portion of its outstanding bonds, and other corporate purposes. The net issuance of debt related to the Excel acquisition was partially offset in 2006 by repurchases of $7.7 million of our 5.875% Senior Notes in the open market, scheduled debt repayments of $11.1 million on our 5% Subordinated Note and other notes payable, and $99.8 million for the repurchase of common stock. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations of $67.0 million was primarily cash provided to Patriot at spin off to fund their working capital needs. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 consisted of the following: December 31, 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 509,084 $ 547,000 Revolving Credit Facility 97,700 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 732,500 732,500 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 650,000 650,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 246,965 246,897 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 218,090 231,845 5.0% Subordinated Note 59,504 6.84% Series C Bonds due 2016 43,000 43,000 6.34% Series B Bonds due 2014 21,000 21,000 6.84% Series A Bonds due 2014 10,000 10,000 Capital lease obligations 92,186 96,869 Fair value of interest rate swaps 1,604 (13,784 ) Other 971 2,201 Total $ 3,273,100 $ 3,277,032 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2006, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a $2.75 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and which amended and restated in full our then existing $1.35 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. The Term Loan Facility, which was fully drawn in October 2006 in connection with the Excel acquisition was paid down in December 2006 ($403.0 million), from a portion of the net proceeds from the Debentures. In conjunction with the establishment of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we incurred $8.6 million in financing costs, of which $5.6 million related to the Revolving Credit Facility and $3.0 million related to the Term Loan Facility. These debt issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over five years, the term of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third 67 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Currently, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus 0.75%, which at December 31, 2007 was 5.4%. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The new facility is less restrictive with respect to limitations on our dividend payments, capital expenditures, asset sales or stock repurchases. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2007, we had $97.7 million borrowings and $413.5 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility is primarily used for standby letters of credit and short term working capital needs. The remaining available borrowing capacity ($1.29 billion as of December 31, 2007) can be used to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs, including additional standby letters of credit. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures as of December 31, 2007. Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures On December 20, 2006, we issued $732.5 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (the Debentures). Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $715.0 million and were used to repay indebtedness under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. The Debentures pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.75% per year. We may elect to, and if and to the extent that a mandatory trigger event (as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures) has occurred and is continuing will be required to, defer interest payments on the Debentures. After five years of deferral at our option, or upon the occurrence of a mandatory trigger event, we generally must sell warrants or preferred stock with specified characteristics and use the funds from that sale to pay deferred interest, subject to certain limitations. In no event may we defer payments of interest on the Debentures for more than 10 years. The Debentures are convertible at any time on or prior to December 15, 2036 if any of the following conditions occur: (i) our closing common stock price exceeds 140% of the then applicable conversion price for the Debentures (currently $81.83 per share) for at least 20 of the final 30 trading days in any quarter; (ii) a notice of redemption is issued with respect to the Debentures; (iii) a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures; (iv) satisfaction of certain trading price conditions; and (v) other specified corporate transactions described in the indenture governing the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures are convertible at any time after December 15, 2036 to December 15, 2041, the scheduled maturity date. In the case of conversion following a notice of redemption or upon a non stock change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures, holders may convert their Debentures into cash in the amount of the principal amount of their Debentures and shares of our common stock for any conversion value in excess of the principal amount. In all other conversion circumstances, holders will receive perpetual preferred stock (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements) with a liquidation preference equal to the principal amount of their Debentures, and any conversion value in excess of the principal amount will be settled with our common stock. As a result of the Patriot spin off, the conversion rate was adjusted to 17.1078 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures effective November 23, 2007. This adjusted conversion rate represents a conversion price of approximately $58.45. The Debentures are unsecured obligations, ranking junior to all existing and future senior and subordinated debt (excluding trade accounts payable or accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business) except for any future debt that ranks equal to or junior to the Debentures. The Debentures will rank equal in right of payment with our obligations to trade creditors. Substantially, all of our existing indebtedness is senior to the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness of 68 our subsidiaries. The indenture governing the Debentures places no limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that we or any of our subsidiaries may incur (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Debentures). 7.375% Senior Notes Due November 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes Due November 2026 On October 12, 2006, we completed a $650.0 million offering of 7.375% 10 year Senior Notes due 2016 and $250 million of 7.875% 20 year Senior Notes due 2026. The notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness; equally in right of payment with any senior indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and effectively junior to all the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and commenced on May 1, 2007. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors, as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions. The notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make whole premium, if applicable, and any accrued unpaid interest to the redemption date. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, were $886.1 million. 6.875% Senior Notes Due March 2013 On March 21, 2003, we issued $650.0 million of 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, pay dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and investments, create liens, sell assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The notes are redeemable prior to March 15, 2008, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium (as defined in the indenture) and on or after March 15, 2008, at fixed redemption prices as set forth in the indenture. 5.875% Senior Notes Due March 2016 On March 23, 2004, we completed an offering of $250.0 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due March 2016. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and commenced on April 15, 2004. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, pay dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and investments, create liens, sell assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The notes are redeemable prior to April 15, 2009, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium (as defined in the indenture) and on or after April 15, 2009, at fixed redemption prices as set forth in the indenture. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, were $244.7 million. Series Bonds As of December 31, 2007, we had $74.0 million in Series Bonds outstanding, which were assumed as part of the Excel acquisition. The 6.84% Series A Bonds have a balloon maturity in December 2014. The 6.34% Series B Bonds mature in December 2014 and are payable in installments beginning December 2008. The 6.84% Series C Bonds mature in December 2016 and are payable in installments beginning December 2012. Interest payments are scheduled to occur in June and December of each year. 69 Interest Rate Swaps As of December 31, 2007, we had entered into a series of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of $120.0 million. Under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate of 6.875% and pay a weighted average floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%, which resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15. The swaps have been designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. We have also entered into another series of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of $100.0 million. Under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate of 5.875% and pay a weighted average floating rate of LIBOR plus 0.25%, which resets each April 15 and October 15. This series of swaps has been designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. In conjunction with the Term Loan Facility, we have a floating to fixed interest rate swap in place for a notional principal amount of $120.0 million. Under the terms of this swap we receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.0% and pay a fixed rate of 6.25%. This interest rate swap was designated as a hedge of the variable interest payments on the Term Loan under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Because the critical terms of the swaps and the respective debt instruments they hedge coincide, there was no hedge ineffectiveness recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 there was an unrealized loss related to the cash flow hedge of $6.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007, there was a net unrealized gain on the fair value hedges of $1.6 million. At December 31, 2006, the net unrealized loss on the fair value hedges was $13.8 million. The fair value hedge is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying value of the Senior Notes (see table above). Third party Security Ratings The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB rating and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on our Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B rating and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement On July 28, 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we can file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. The Debentures, 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Excel Transaction In October 2006, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel) for US$1.54 billion in cash plus assumed debt of US$293.0 million, less US$30.0 million of cash acquired in the transaction. This acquisition was financed with borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and Senior Notes due 2016 and 2026 (see Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the financing of the Excel acquisition). The Excel acquisition included three operating mines and three development stage mines (all of which are 70 operating as of December 31, 2007), with up to 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. The results of operations of Excel are included in our Australian Mining Operations segment from October 2006. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Excel acquisition). Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,781,312 $ 344,324 $ 471,852 $ 825,632 $ 4,139,504 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 116,861 17,349 34,258 30,234 35,020 Operating lease obligations 359,045 85,356 120,218 71,759 81,712 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 168,923 168,923 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 383,416 187,946 139,564 12,777 43,129 Other long term liabilities(2) 1,302,039 112,418 215,443 210,275 763,903 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,111,596 $ 916,316 $ 981,335 $ 1,150,677 $ 5,063,268 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2007, we had $67.8 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $301.6 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next three years. Total capital expenditures for 2008 are expected to range from $350 million to $400 million, excluding federal coal reserve lease payments, and relate to replacement, improvement, or expansion of existing mines, particularly in Australia, the El Segundo mine development in New Mexico, and growth initiatives such as increasing capacity in the Powder River Basin. Capital expenditures were funded primarily through operating cash flow. Our subsidiary, Peabody Pacific, has committed to pay up to a maximum of A$0.20/tonne (approximately US$0.15/tonne) of coal sales for a period of five years to the Australian COAL21 Fund. The COAL21 Fund is a voluntary coal industry fund to support clean coal technology demonstration projects and research in Australia. All major coal companies in Australia have committed to this fund. The commitment to pay started on April 1, 2007 with a levy of A$0.10/tonne of coal sales. This levy rose to A$0.20/tonne on July 1, 2007. We do not expect any of the $152.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. 71 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2007: Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self Bonding $ 640.6 $ $ $ $ $ 640.6 Surety Bonds 418.3 73.0 31.2 16.7 539.2 Letters of Credit 1.6 102.7 41.4 267.9 413.6 $ 1,060.5 $ 73.0 $ 133.9 $ 41.4 $ 284.6 $ 1,593.4 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the PBGC and collateral for surety companies. As part of arrangements through which we obtain exclusive sales representation agreements with small coal mining companies (the Counterparties), we issued financial guarantees on behalf of the Counterparties. These guarantees facilitate the Counterparties efforts to obtain bonding or financing. In 2007, we purchased approximately 345 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands in the Illinois Basin. In conjunction with this purchase, we agreed to provide up to $64.8 million of reclamation and bonding commitments to a third party coal company. We have recognized the full amount of these commitments as a liability as of December 31, 2007. The non cash portion of this transaction was excluded from the investing section of the statement of cash flows. In the event of default, the terms of our guarantees provide for multiple recourse options, including the ability to assume the loans and procure title and use of the equipment purchased through the loans. If default occurs, we have the ability and intent to exercise our recourse options, so the liability associated with the guarantee has been valued at zero. The aggregate amount guaranteed for all such Counterparties was $8.8 million at December 31, 2007. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of our guarantees. As part of the Patriot spin off, we agreed to maintain in force several letters of credit that secured Patriot obligations for certain employee benefits and workers compensation obligations. These letters of credit are to be released upon Patriot satisfying the beneficiaries with alternate letters of credit or insurance, which is expected to occur in 2008. If Patriot is unable to satisfy the primary beneficiaries by June 30, 2011, they are then required to provide directly to us a letter of credit in the amount of the remaining obligation. As of December 31, 2007, the amount of letters of credit securing Patriot obligations was $136.8 million. Under our accounts receivable securitization program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $11.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The securitization program is scheduled to expire in September 2009. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the 72 consolidated balance sheets. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $275.0 million and $219.2 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounts receivable securitization). The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2007: Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Over Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 1,800,000 $ $ $ 1,800,000 $ Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48). This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, and as a result, reported $135.0 million of net unrecognized tax benefits ($144.0 million gross) in our consolidated financial statements. Due to the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset for NOL carryforwards as of January 1, 2007, none of the $135.0 million required an adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158). For fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, SFAS No. 158 required recognition of the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans (an asset for overfunded status or a liability for underfunded status) in a companys balance sheet. In addition, the standard required recognition of actuarial gains and losses, prior service cost, and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS No. 106) when determining a plans funded status, with a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We adopted SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006, and as a result, recorded a noncurrent liability of $376.1 million, which reflected the total underfunded status of the pension, retiree healthcare and workers compensation plans. The funded status of each plan was measured as the difference between the fair value of the assets and the projected benefit obligation (the funded status). SFAS No. 158 did not impact net income. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and therefore does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008 for the Company). In February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS No. 157 to exclude leasing transactions and to delay the effective date by one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 73 provides all entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008 for the Company). We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for (1) noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and (2) the loss of control of subsidiaries. SFAS No. 160 requires noncontrolling interests (minority interests) to be reported as a separate component of equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. SFAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for the Company). Early adoption is not allowed. We are in the process of determining the effect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R) significantly changes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This statement also provides guidance for the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination and for determination of required disclosures that will enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for the Company). We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal, freight and emissions allowance trading, fuel, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal, freight and emissions allowance trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading fuel, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter, exchange based and direct trading of coal, freight and emission allowances (collectively coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the 74 potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both swaps and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes 5 and 15 day holding periods, as applicable, and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our value at risk measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the combined actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $1.2 million, $13.7 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. Our value at risk increased over the prior year due to greater price volatility in the coal markets, particularly in the international markets into which we have recently expanded. As of December 31, 2007, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Percentage Year of Expiration of Portfolio 2008 58 % 2009 41 % 2010 0 % 2011 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. In general, increases in coal price volatility and our own trading activity resulted in greater exposure to our coal trading counterparties during the year. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. 75 Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2008 targets hedging at least approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2007, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling A$2.03 billion of which A$1.08 billion, A$556.7 million, and A$388.8 million will expire in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in Operating costs and expenses due to a $0.01 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $12 million for 2008. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $1.6 million in 2008. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.57 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $707.2 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $7.1 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $0.3 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 94% and 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we had 5 to 10 million tons of expected U.S. production unpriced for 2008. We had 9 to 10 million tons remaining to be priced for 2008 in Australia at December 31, 2007. We have approximately 80 to 90 million tons of expected U.S. production unpriced for 2009, with an additional 17 to 20 million tons of expected Australia coal production unpriced for 2009. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. As of December 31, 2007, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel and explosives. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts were 114.8 million gallons of crude oil scheduled to expire through 2010. We expect to consume 125 to 130 million gallons of fuel next year. A one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $2.4 million. Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts, scheduled to expire through 2010, were 5.7 mmbtu of natural gas. We expect to consume 315,000 to 325,000 tons of explosives per year. Through our natural gas hedge contracts, we have fixed prices for approximately 49% of our anticipated explosives requirements for 2008. Based on our expected usage, a change in natural gas prices of ten cents per mmbtu (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our operating costs of approximately $0.6 million per year. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 31 coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions, except Appalachia, and international interests in Australia and Venezuela. In 2007, we sold 237.8 million tons of coal. Our U.S. sales represented 19% of all U.S. coal sales and were approximately 80% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. United States coal demand was approximately 1.1 billion tons in 2007, based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Coals predominate use is for baseload electricity requirements. For the 12 months ended November 2007, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 50%, a share that the EIA projects will grow to 55% by 2030. EIA projects an additional 130 gigawatts of new U.S. coal fueled generation by 2030, including 9 gigawatts at coal to liquids plants and 45 gigawatts at integrated gasification combined cycle plants, which represents more than 500 million tons of additional coal demand. Domestic coal consumption is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 1.8% from 2007 through 2030 when U.S. coal demand is forecasted to reach 1.7 billion tons. Coal production located west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth as Western production increases to an estimated 65% share of total production in 2030 versus 58% in 2007. Globally, we believe that coal demand is driven by electricity generation (65%) and industrial use (31%), including steel making. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates coals share of total world energy consumption is projected to increase from 25% in 2005 to 28% through 2030, and in the electric power sector, its share is estimated to rise from 43% in 2004 to 45% in 2030. More than 80% of the growth in global coal demand is expected to come from China and India. These two countries comprise approximately 45% of global coal use, which is projected by IEA to grow to 80% by 2030. China alone added an estimated 96 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation in 2007, representing more than 300 million tons of annual coal use. Coal demand in India is forecasted to nearly triple by 2030. In total, global coal consumption is expected to grow 73%, or more than 4 billion tons by 2030. Our primary U.S. customers are utilities, which accounted for 85% of our sales in 2007. Our international production is sold primarily into export markets. Our international activities accounted for 13% of our sales by volume in 2007. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2007, approximately 94% of our sales were under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2007, production totaled 214.1 million tons and sales totaled 237.8 million tons. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations, and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could 51 be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. However, we expect to adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Eastern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations, and our Eastern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The principal business of the Western and Eastern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Geologically, Western operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits and Eastern operations mine bituminous coal deposits. Our Western U.S. Mining operations are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Our Eastern U.S. Mining operations are characterized by a mix of surface and underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal, and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as steam coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a small portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. In the second half of 2006, through two separate transactions, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel), an independent coal company in Australia for a total acquisition price of US$1.51 billion, net of cash received, plus approximately $293.0 million in assumed debt. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for information on the financing of the Excel transaction. Assets acquired include three operating mines and three development stage mines, along with up to 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produces approximately 6 to 8 million tons of steam coal annually for export to the United States and Europe. During 2007, the Paso Diablo Mine contributed $21.2 million to segment Adjusted EBITDA in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and paid a dividend of $12.9 million. At December 31, 2007, our investment in Paso Diablo was $68.4 million. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from four of our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 4% of our total sales volume, but represents a larger share of our revenue, approximately 15% in 2007. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 92% of revenues in 2007, we generate revenues and additional cash flows from our Trading and Brokerage operations (7% of revenues), and other activities, including transactions utilizing our vast natural resource position (selling non core land holdings and mineral interests). We continue to pursue the development of coal fueled generating projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. The projects involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. We own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. We are pursuing development of the 1,500 megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The plants, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. The EIA projects that the high price of oil will lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including Btu Conversion technologies, and that coal will increase its share as a fuel for electricity generation. We are exploring several Btu Conversion projects, which are designed to expand the 52 uses of coal through various technologies, and we are continuing to explore options particularly as they relate to Btu Conversion technologies such as coal to liquids and coal gasification. In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares for $99.8 million under this repurchase program. On October 31, 2007, we spun off portions of our Eastern U.S. Mining operations business segment to form Patriot. We distributed Patriot stock to our stockholders at a ratio of one share of Patriot stock for every 10 shares of Peabody stock held on the record date of October 22, 2007. Our results for all periods presented reflect Patriot as a discontinued operation. The spin off included eight company operated mines, two majority owned joint venture mines, and numerous contractor operated mines serviced by eight coal preparation facilities along with 1.2 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves. Prior to the spin off, we received necessary regulatory approvals including a private letter ruling on the tax free nature of the transaction from the Internal Revenue Service. Results of Operations The portions of the Eastern U.S. Mining operations business segment that were included in the spin off of Patriot have been classified as discontinued operations and are excluded from the operating results for all periods presented. See the description of the spin off in Part I, Item 1 Discontinued Operations. Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting early debt extinguishment costs, net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Summary Higher average sales prices across all U.S. regions and increased volumes, primarily from Australian Mining operations, contributed to an 11.4% increase in revenues to $4.57 billion compared to 2006. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.4% to $1.06 billion primarily on higher prices in the Western U.S. and increased results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues, higher commodity costs, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar. Also, negatively impacting Australian Mining results was lower metallurgical coal prices associated with annual contracts that began in April 2007. Income from continuing operations was $421.3 million in 2007, or $1.56 per diluted share, a decrease of 23.8% from 2006 income from continuing operations of $552.6 million, or $2.05 per diluted share. 53 Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2007 2006 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 161.4 160.5 0.9 0.6 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 30.9 30.4 0.5 1.6 % Australian Mining Operations 21.4 11.0 10.4 94.5 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 24.1 21.4 2.7 12.6 % Total tons sold 237.8 223.3 14.5 6.5 % Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 2,061,265 $ 1,703,445 $ 357,820 21.0 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 984,841 905,743 79,098 8.7 % Australian Mining Operations 1,161,093 843,194 317,899 37.7 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 320,692 652,029 (331,337 ) (50.8 )% Other 46,821 3,985 42,836 1074.9 % Total revenues $ 4,574,712 $ 4,108,396 $ 466,316 11.4 % In 2007, our total revenues were $4.57 billion, an increase of $466.3 million, or 11.4%, compared to the prior year, which resulted from sales price increases in all U.S. regions, most notably in our Powder River Basin operations and increased volumes from Australia. Volumes related to operations acquired in the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 10.9 million tons of the increase to tons sold. Partially offsetting sales price and volume increases was the continued shift towards trading contracts versus brokerage contracts in our Trading and Brokerage operations. Trading and Brokerage operations sales decreased during the year as the amount of brokerage business was reduced and replacement business was in the form of traded contracts. Contracts for trading activity are recorded at net margin in other revenues, whereas contracts for brokerage activity are recorded at gross sales price to revenues and operating costs. While the shift to trading contracts reduced total sales, there was no impact to Adjusted EBITDA. Overall, prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased due to a sales realization increase of approximately 29% for our premium Powder River Basin product and an average increase across all U.S. regions of 16%. In addition, Eastern U.S. Mining revenues increased due to higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants as those plants were idled for part of 2006. Offsetting this increase was lower average sales prices in our Australian Mining operations related to lower metallurgical contract pricing and a significant change in sales mix resulting in higher thermal export and domestic product sales. Volumes were unfavorably impacted at some of our Australian Mining operations as a result of damaged rails and further amplified port and rail congestion throughout the year, in addition to adverse weather events in the second quarter that affected production. 54 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $1.06 billion for the year ended 2007, compared with $1.03 billion in the prior year. Details were as follows: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 597,333 $ 473,074 $ 124,259 26.3 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 196,595 184,549 12,046 6.5 % Australian Mining Operations 159,473 278,411 (118,938 ) (42.7 )% Trading and Brokerage Operations 110,169 92,604 17,565 19.0 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,063,570 $ 1,028,638 $ 34,932 3.4 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $124.3 million, or 26.3%, during the year primarily related to the overall increase in average sales prices from our Powder River Basin operations. Partially offsetting higher average sales prices were higher costs associated with equipment repairs and maintenance and higher add on taxes and royalties driven by higher sales prices compared to the prior year, mine shutdown for maintenance in our Colorado region in December, higher fuel costs and adverse weather conditions in the Powder River Basin and capital project delays in the first half of the year. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $12.0 million, or 6.5%, compared to prior year as both volumes and prices per ton saw moderate increases. Results improved compared to prior year as benefits of higher volumes and sales prices were offset by higher costs for commodities, including fuel. The 2007 results were also positively impacted by higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel facilities of $12.5 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants for a portion of 2006. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased $118.9 million, or 42.7%, compared to prior year primarily due to approximately $31 million of higher costs resulting from the weakening U.S. dollar (higher costs of approximately $112 million were offset by hedging gains of $81 million); higher congestion related demurrage costs (approximately $50 million); lower pricing on annually repriced metallurgical coal contracts; and, rail and port congestion at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and the Port of Newcastle. Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal has been experiencing queues of over 41 vessels (approximately a 24 day load time) down from 50 vessels in the second quarter (approximately a 34 day delay). Partially offsetting these decreases were the full year contributions from our mines acquired in the Excel acquisition and a $6.3 million insurance recovery on a business interruption claim in the first half of 2007. Our Australian mines acquired in 2006 experienced shipping difficulties and damaged rail lines resulting from a storm late in the second quarter. The Port of Newcastle was closed for several days in June due to a storm, with up to 79 vessels in the queue (a 35 40 day wait). Queues at Newcastle have recently been reduced to 31 vessels (11 day wait). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.6 million from the prior year, as 2007 results reflected higher international trading gains, resulting from higher volumes and pricing due to expanded global trading activities, strong supply/demand fundamentals and tightened seaborne market conditions. 55 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,063,570 $ 1,028,638 $ 34,932 3.4 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (107,677 ) (127,682 ) 20,005 15.7 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (361,559 ) (294,270 ) (67,289 ) (22.9 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (25,610 ) (15,830 ) (9,780 ) (61.8 )% Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (234,983 ) (139,064 ) (95,919 ) (69.0 )% Interest income 7,094 11,309 (4,215 ) (37.3 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 340,835 $ 463,101 $ (122,266 ) (26.4 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests of $340.8 million for 2007 is $122.3 million, or 26.4%, lower than 2006 primarily due to higher interest expense and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the acquisition of Excel in late 2006. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint venture, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, Btu Conversion and resource management. The $20.0 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2007 compared to 2006 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $35.2 million. The 2007 activity included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves to the Prairie State equity partners. Our 2007 activity also included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of our coalbed methane and oil and gas rights in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for high Btu coal reserves located in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. In comparison, the 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million; Higher past mining obligation expenses of $15.5 million resulting from increased retiree healthcare costs due to higher than anticipated healthcare utilization by retirees, particularly related to prescription drugs; Higher selling and administrative expenses of $19.1 million during the year primarily resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and other corporate development initiatives; and Lower equity income of $6.8 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela), which primarily resulted from trucking issues experienced earlier in the year, a temporary shortage of explosives, and delays in receiving equipment, which impacted operations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $67.3 million primarily related to the addition of the Australian operations acquired in late 2006. Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs increased $95.9 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion in new debt issued or assumed as part of the Excel acquisition in the second half of 2006. 56 Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 340,835 $ 463,101 $ (122,266 ) (26.4 )% Income tax benefit 78,112 90,084 (11,972 ) (13.3 )% Minority interests 2,316 (611 ) 2,927 479.1 % Income from continuing operations 421,263 552,574 (131,311 ) (23.8 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations (156,978 ) 48,123 (205,101 ) (426.2 )% Net income $ 264,285 $ 600,697 $ (336,412 ) (56.0 )% Income from continuing operations decreased $131.3 million in 2007 compared to prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and a lower income tax benefit compared to 2006. The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended 2007 related primarily to a $56.0 million foreign currency impact on deferred taxes as a result of increases in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rates and $33.2 million lower tax reserves than in the prior year, partially offset by lower pre tax income, a $10.3 million increase in released valuation allowances, and $24.3 million of additional tax credits. Minority interests increased primarily from the absorption of losses in excess of the minority interest capital contribution at one of our mines, partially offset by lower earnings allocable to partners. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Summary Higher average sales prices and increased volumes in the Eastern U.S., Powder River Basin and Australian Mining operations, including the October 2006 acquisition of three mines in Australia, contributed to a 12.1% increase in revenues to $4.11 billion compared to 2005. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 17.8% to $1.03 billion primarily on growth in international volumes and higher sales prices from our Australian Mining operations and increased contributions from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by operational challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from rail performance in the Powder River Basin and port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues as well as mine closures in our Western U.S. Mining operations in late 2005. Net income was $600.7 million in 2006, or $2.23 per diluted share, an increase of 42.1% over 2005 net income of $422.7 million, or $1.58 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining Operations 160.5 154.3 6.2 4.0 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 30.4 28.7 1.7 5.9 % Australian Mining Operations 11.0 8.3 2.7 32.5 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 21.4 24.8 (3.4 ) (13.7 )% Total tons sold 223.3 216.1 7.2 3.3 % 57 Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 1,703,445 $ 1,611,587 $ 91,858 5.7 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 905,743 760,404 145,339 19.1 % Australian Mining Operations 843,194 598,085 245,109 41.0 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 652,029 679,176 (27,147 ) (4.0 )% Other 3,985 16,924 (12,939 ) (76.5 )% Total revenues $ 4,108,396 $ 3,666,176 $ 442,220 12.1 % In 2006, our total revenues were $4.11 billion, an increase of $442.2 million, or 12.1%, compared to prior year, which resulted from sales price increases in all regions, particularly in our Eastern and Australian operations and demand driven sales volume increases in the Powder River Basin, Midwest and Australian operations. Volumes related to the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 2.1 million tons of the increase to tons sold and approximately 43% of the increase to sales in Australia. Partially offsetting sales price increases were lower western regional sales due to the late 2005 mine closures in the Western U.S. Mining operations and lower brokerage volumes. Overall, prices and volumes in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased, mainly reflecting increases to sales prices of over $0.70 per ton and volumes of 12.7 million tons in the Powder River Basin. These increases at our Powder River Basin operations resulted from strong demand for the mines low sulfur products and improved rail conditions compared to 2005, when the region was dealing with major railroad maintenance. Despite rail performance improvements relative to 2005, constrained rail capacity continued to limit growth in the region in 2006. Also, affecting Western U.S. Mining revenues was lower production due to the cessation of mining operations at our Seneca and Black Mesa mines in late 2005 and unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues at our Twentymile Mine. Per ton sales prices in our Eastern U.S. Mining operations increased and sales volumes increased due primarily to our Gateway mine, which began operation in late 2005. Partially offset by the overall increase in 2006 total revenues was the customer idling of synfuel plants during 2006. Revenues from our Australian Mining operations were $245.1 million, or 41.0%, higher than in 2005, primarily due to higher international metallurgical coal prices, higher production at our underground mine following installation of a new longwall in the second quarter of 2006 and additional volumes from our newly acquired mines ($105.1 million). A higher per ton sales price reflected higher contract prices in 2006 for metallurgical coal as well as the slower realization of metallurgical coal price increases in 2005 when we operated under some lower priced carry over contracts from 2004 through most of the first nine months of 2005. Brokerage operations revenues decreased $27.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher sales prices and proceeds of $28.2 million from settlement of commitments by a third party coal producer following a brokerage contract restructuring. 58 Segment Adjusted EBITDA Our total segment Adjusted EBITDA was $1.03 billion for the year ended 2006 compared with $873.5 million in 2005. Details were as follows: Segment Adjusted EBITDA Increase to Segment Year Ended December 31, Adjusted EBITDA 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Western U.S. Mining Operations $ 473,074 $ 459,039 $ 14,035 3.1 % Eastern U.S. Mining Operations 184,549 168,793 15,756 9.3 % Australian Mining Operations 278,411 202,582 75,829 37.4 % Trading and Brokerage Operations 92,604 43,058 49,546 115.1 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,028,638 $ 873,472 $ 155,166 17.8 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased $14.0 million, or 3.1%, during 2006 primarily reflecting an increase in sales volumes of 12.7 million tons at our Powder River Basin operations, which resulted from continued strong demand and improved rail performance relative to 2005. Western U.S. Mining operations sales price per ton increased moderately due to mix changes resulting from ceasing operations at our Black Mesa and Seneca mines. Western U.S. Mining operations cost increases were driven by higher fuel costs, an increase in revenue based royalties and production taxes, and the timing of major repairs. In addition, we experienced unfavorable geologic conditions and equipment issues related to the new longwall system at our Twentymile Mine; however, a recovery of certain costs associated with the equipment difficulties lessened the impact of these issues on our 2006 results. The Western U.S. Mining operations were also negatively impacted in 2006 by the cessation of operations at the Black Mesa mine in late 2005. Eastern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $15.8 million, or 9.3%, compared to 2005 primarily due to higher volumes and sales prices, partially offset by higher costs per ton due to fuel costs, revenue based royalties and production taxes as well as higher costs associated with equipment and geologic issues. The 2006 results were also negatively impacted by lower revenues from synthetic fuel facilities of $10.1 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $75.8 million, or 37.4%, compared to 2005 primarily due to increased sales volumes following increased production from the second quarter installation of a new longwall system at our underground mine, higher metallurgical coal sales prices, and a $19.7 million contribution from our newly acquired mines. Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased $49.5 million from 2005, as 2006 results included proceeds from restructuring the brokerage contract mentioned above, improved brokerage margins and contributions from the newly established international trading operation, partially offset by lower U.S. trading results. 59 Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,028,638 $ 873,472 $ 155,166 17.8 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (127,682 ) (165,623 ) 37,941 22.9 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (294,270 ) (253,788 ) (40,482 ) (16.0 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (15,830 ) (20,329 ) 4,499 22.1 % Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs (139,064 ) (98,066 ) (40,998 ) (41.8 )% Interest income 11,309 9,088 2,221 24.4 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 463,101 $ 344,754 $ 118,347 34.3 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests of $463.1 million for 2006 is $118.3 million, or 34.3%, higher than 2005 primarily due to improved segment Adjusted EBITDA as discussed above. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as coalbed methane, generation development, Btu Conversion and resource management. The $37.9 million improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (net expense) in 2006 compared to 2005 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $9.1 million. The 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million. In comparison, activity in 2005 included a $31.1 million gain from the sale of our remaining 0.838 million units of Penn Virginia Resource Partners, L.P., a $12.5 million gain from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and properties, and other gains on asset disposals of $0.8 million; Higher equity income of $8.0 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela; Lower selling and administrative expenses of $4.6 million primarily associated with lower performance based incentive costs, partially offset by increases to share based compensation expense as a result of the new requirement to expense stock options, costs to support corporate and international growth initiatives and costs for the development and installation of a new enterprise resource planning system. The lower costs associated with the performance based incentive plan related to a long term, executive incentive plan that is driven by shareholder return and reflected lower stock price appreciation in 2006 than in 2005; and Lower net expenses of $4.7 million related to the development of the Prairie State Energy Campus due to a higher rate of cost reimbursement from the partners in 2006. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $40.5 million in 2006 due to higher production volume, acquisitions and the impact of escalating capital costs and new capital, including two new longwall installations and new mine development. Also, 2005 depreciation, depletion and amortization was net of amortization of acquired contract liabilities. Interest expense and early debt extinguishment costs increased $41.0 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion of debt issued or assumed in the second half of 2006 as part of the Excel acquisition. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more details of the debt issued. 60 Net Income Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2006 2005 $ % (Dollars in thousands) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 463,101 $ 344,754 $ 118,347 34.3 % Income tax benefit (provision) 90,084 (63,779 ) 153,863 241.2 % Minority interests (611 ) (2,472 ) 1,861 75.3 % Income from continuing operations 552,574 278,503 274,071 98.4 % Income from discontinued operations 48,123 144,150 (96,027 ) (66.6 )% Net income $ 600,697 $ 422,653 $ 178,044 42.1 % Income from continuing operations increased $274.1 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due to the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and an income tax benefit compared to an income tax provision in 2005. The income tax benefit for the year ended 2006 related primarily to a reduction in tax reserves no longer required due to the finalization of various federal and state returns and expiration of applicable statute of limitations, and a reduction in a portion of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards. The reduction to the valuation allowance resulted from an increase to estimated future taxable income primarily resulting from long term contracts signed in late 2006 which increased our ability to realize these benefits in the future. Minority interests increased primarily as a result of acquiring an additional interest in a joint venture near the end of the first quarter of 2006. Outlook Events Impacting Near Term Operations Global coal markets continued to grow, driven by increased demand from growing and developing economies. The U.S. economy grew 2.2% for 2007 as reported by the U.S. Commerce Department, while Chinas economy grew 11.4% in 2007 as published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Growing constraints of global coal supplies ignited U.S. coal export interests beginning in the third quarter of 2007. By the start of 2008, global supply challenges became even greater. Flooding in Queensland, Australia in early 2008 is estimated to reduce seaborne coal supplies by more than 10 million metric tons; China issued a temporary moratorium on 2008 coal exports to secure supply for domestic needs, and South Africa temporarily shutdown coal production destined for export markets to conserve energy while reestablishing sufficient domestic coal supply. As a result, U.S. coal products are realizing expanded market reach resulting in higher published prices for all products. We expect to capitalize on the strong global markets primarily through production and sales of metallurgical and thermal coal from our Australian operations as well as through our U.S. and international coal trading activities. In Australia, we anticipate selling 23 to 25 million tons in 2008, as much as 17% higher than 2007s level. Of our anticipated shipments, we have nine to 10 million tons of coal production available to be priced in 2008, approximately two thirds of which is metallurgical coal. Our 2008 results will be affected by the final Australian coal price settlements. Our two primary shipping points, Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and Port of Newcastle, continue to experience lengthy vessel queues, extreme weather conditions impacting operations and the coal logistics chain, and transportation challenges, which could result in delayed shipments and demurrage charges. In the U.S., we anticipate higher volumes in 2008 versus 2007 from all the coal basins where we operate. Approximately 97% of our higher 2008 volumes are committed to existing customer contracts. In addition, the higher 2008 volume includes the mid year startup of a new mine in the Southwestern U.S. Our 2008 results will be impacted to the extent we complete ramp up activities on time and at expected capacity. Although we 61 currently expect to increase our shipment levels, our ability to reach targeted volumes is dependent upon the performance of the rail carriers. We expect strong improvements in U.S. and Australia operating results from higher prices and increased volumes, partly offset by some of the factors discussed above and escalation of key supply costs including approximately $150 million in higher energy related expenses and the effects of exchange rates. Long term Outlook Our outlook for the coal markets remains positive. We believe strong coal markets will continue worldwide, as long as growth continues in the U.S., Asia and other industrialized economies that are increasing coal demand for electricity generation and steelmaking. More than 100 gigawatts of new coal fueled electricity generating capacity is scheduled to come on line around the world between 2008 and 2010, and the EIA projects an additional 130 gigawatts of new U.S. coal fueled generation by 2030, including 9 gigawatts at coal to liquids plants and 45 gigawatts at integrated gasification combined cycle plants, which represents more than 500 million tons of additional coal demand. Coal to gas (CTG) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants represent a significant avenue for long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including CTL, and in the U.S. CTL technologies are receiving U.S. support from both political parties. China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. Demand for Powder River Basin coal remains strong, particularly for our ultra low sulfur products. The Powder River Basin represents more than half of our production. We control approximately 3.3 billion tons of proven and probable reserves in the Southern Powder River Basin, and we sold 139.8 million tons of coal from this region during 2007. We are targeting 2008 production of 220 to 240 million tons and total sales volume of 240 to 260 million tons, both of which include 23 to 25 million tons from Australia. As of December 31, 2007, our unpriced volumes for 2008 planned production included nine to 10 million Australian tons, two thirds of which is metallurgical coal, and five to seven million U.S. tons. Unpriced volumes for 2009 include 17 to 20 million Australian tons, approximately half of which is metallurgical coal, and 80 to 90 million U.S. tons. Management plans to aggressively control costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We are experiencing increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs, including a company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. In addition, historically low long term interest rates also have a negative impact on expenses related to our actuarially determined, employee related liabilities. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage source performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the United States or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, could result in electric generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. We continue to support clean coal technology development and voluntary initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation as a founding member of the FutureGen Alliance, through our commitment to the Australian COAL21 Fund, and through our participation in the Power Systems Development Facility, the PowerTree Carbon Company LLC, and the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate. In addition, we are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, the first near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) which is under development in China. 62 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities We have significant long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 15 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006 resulted in each of these liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 being equal to the actuarially determined funded status of the plans. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $102.2 million, while payments were $71.6 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. Our most significant employee liability is postretirement health care, and assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 11,202 $ (9,580 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 81,535 $ (70,842 ) 63 Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in thousands) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 1,076 $ (1,913 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (35,166 ) $ 41,399 Total (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 8.92 years at December 31, 2007. Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage, the timing of these cash flows, and a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $25.6 million, and payments totaled $10.2 million. See detailed information regarding our asset retirement obligations in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. We establish reserves for tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported, certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained. The tax contingency reserves are analyzed on a quarterly basis and adjusted based upon changes in facts and circumstances, such as the progress of federal and state audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency reserves and changes to the reserves, including related interest. We establish the reserves based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences (i.e. tax depletion expense, etc.) and certain tax sharing agreements. We are subject to federal audits for several open years due to our previous inclusion in multiple consolidated groups and the various parties involved in finalizing those years. Additional details regarding the effect of income taxes on our consolidated financial statements is available in Note 12. Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the 64 financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 95% of our revenue in 2007 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Coal sales are made to our customers under the terms of coal supply agreements, most of which are long term (greater than one year). Under the typical terms of these coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal, freight and emissions allowances, both in over the counter markets and on exchanges. Our coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value basis under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. To establish fair values for our trading contracts, we use bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal, freight and emission allowance positions from the over the counter market. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. Published settlement prices are used to value our exchange based positions. As of December 31, 2007, 97% of the contracts in our trading portfolio were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials. As of December 31, 2007, 58% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2008 and 99% within 24 months. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Exploration and Drilling Costs Exploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Advance Stripping Costs Pre production: At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre production box cut to remove overburden (i.e., advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (i.e., advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices. Post production: Advance stripping costs related to post production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, we expense such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment. 65 Business Combinations We account for our business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment, and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which we adopted using the modified prospective option on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123(R), share based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award. We utilize restricted stock, nonqualified stock options, performance units, and an employee stock purchase plan as part of our share based compensation program. Determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions, including items such as expected term, risk free rate and expected volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including sales of our accounts receivable through our securitization program. Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as planned acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends, among other things, are subject to limitations imposed by our Senior Notes and Debenture covenants. We expect to fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $447.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of $144.2 million compared to $591.4 million provided by operating activities from continuing operations in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to lower profitability from our operations. Net cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations of $130.8 million was primarily used to fund the regions net operating loss and for cash costs of the spin off. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $541.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $2.06 billion used in the prior year. The decrease was primarily related to the acquisition of Excel of $1.51 billion, net of cash acquired, in 2006 and higher proceeds of $90.2 million from disposals of assets in 2007. Partially offsetting these items was higher capital spending of $72.9 million. Capital expenditures in 2007 included mine development at our recently acquired Australian mines, the completion of an in pit conveyor system, and coal blending and loadout facility at one of our Western U.S. mines and the purchase of coal reserves and surface lands in the Illinois Basin. Net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was $33.6 million and was used for pre spin capital costs for Patriot. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $44.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $1.41 billion provided in 2006. During 2007, we repaid $37.9 million of our Term Loan and purchased in the open market $13.8 million face value of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. We also made the final principal payment of $59.5 million on our 5% Subordinated Note. Our Revolving Credit Facility balance increased to $97.7 million as it was utilized to fund cash contributions to 66 Patriot at the spin off. In 2006, we issued net borrowings of $1.74 billion, which we utilized to fund the $1.51 billion Excel acquisition, the repayment of Excels bank facility and a portion of its outstanding bonds, and other corporate purposes. The net issuance of debt related to the Excel acquisition was partially offset in 2006 by repurchases of $7.7 million of our 5.875% Senior Notes in the open market, scheduled debt repayments of $11.1 million on our 5% Subordinated Note and other notes payable, and $99.8 million for the repurchase of common stock. Net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations of $67.0 million was primarily cash provided to Patriot at spin off to fund their working capital needs. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 consisted of the following: December 31, 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 509,084 $ 547,000 Revolving Credit Facility 97,700 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 732,500 732,500 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 650,000 650,000 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650,000 650,000 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 246,965 246,897 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 218,090 231,845 5.0% Subordinated Note 59,504 6.84% Series C Bonds due 2016 43,000 43,000 6.34% Series B Bonds due 2014 21,000 21,000 6.84% Series A Bonds due 2014 10,000 10,000 Capital lease obligations 92,186 96,869 Fair value of interest rate swaps 1,604 (13,784 ) Other 971 2,201 Total $ 3,273,100 $ 3,277,032 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2006, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a $2.75 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and which amended and restated in full our then existing $1.35 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. The Term Loan Facility, which was fully drawn in October 2006 in connection with the Excel acquisition was paid down in December 2006 ($403.0 million), from a portion of the net proceeds from the Debentures. In conjunction with the establishment of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we incurred $8.6 million in financing costs, of which $5.6 million related to the Revolving Credit Facility and $3.0 million related to the Term Loan Facility. These debt issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over five years, the term of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and Euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third 67 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Currently, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus 0.75%, which at December 31, 2007 was 5.4%. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The new facility is less restrictive with respect to limitations on our dividend payments, capital expenditures, asset sales or stock repurchases. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2007, we had $97.7 million borrowings and $413.5 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility is primarily used for standby letters of credit and short term working capital needs. The remaining available borrowing capacity ($1.29 billion as of December 31, 2007) can be used to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs, including additional standby letters of credit. We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures as of December 31, 2007. Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures On December 20, 2006, we issued $732.5 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 (the Debentures). Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were $715.0 million and were used to repay indebtedness under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. The Debentures pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.75% per year. We may elect to, and if and to the extent that a mandatory trigger event (as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures) has occurred and is continuing will be required to, defer interest payments on the Debentures. After five years of deferral at our option, or upon the occurrence of a mandatory trigger event, we generally must sell warrants or preferred stock with specified characteristics and use the funds from that sale to pay deferred interest, subject to certain limitations. In no event may we defer payments of interest on the Debentures for more than 10 years. The Debentures are convertible at any time on or prior to December 15, 2036 if any of the following conditions occur: (i) our closing common stock price exceeds 140% of the then applicable conversion price for the Debentures (currently $81.83 per share) for at least 20 of the final 30 trading days in any quarter; (ii) a notice of redemption is issued with respect to the Debentures; (iii) a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures; (iv) satisfaction of certain trading price conditions; and (v) other specified corporate transactions described in the indenture governing the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures are convertible at any time after December 15, 2036 to December 15, 2041, the scheduled maturity date. In the case of conversion following a notice of redemption or upon a non stock change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Debentures, holders may convert their Debentures into cash in the amount of the principal amount of their Debentures and shares of our common stock for any conversion value in excess of the principal amount. In all other conversion circumstances, holders will receive perpetual preferred stock (see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements) with a liquidation preference equal to the principal amount of their Debentures, and any conversion value in excess of the principal amount will be settled with our common stock. As a result of the Patriot spin off, the conversion rate was adjusted to 17.1078 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures effective November 23, 2007. This adjusted conversion rate represents a conversion price of approximately $58.45. The Debentures are unsecured obligations, ranking junior to all existing and future senior and subordinated debt (excluding trade accounts payable or accrued liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business) except for any future debt that ranks equal to or junior to the Debentures. The Debentures will rank equal in right of payment with our obligations to trade creditors. Substantially, all of our existing indebtedness is senior to the Debentures. In addition, the Debentures will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness of 68 our subsidiaries. The indenture governing the Debentures places no limitation on the amount of additional indebtedness that we or any of our subsidiaries may incur (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Debentures). 7.375% Senior Notes Due November 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes Due November 2026 On October 12, 2006, we completed a $650.0 million offering of 7.375% 10 year Senior Notes due 2016 and $250 million of 7.875% 20 year Senior Notes due 2026. The notes are general unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness; equally in right of payment with any senior indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and effectively junior to all the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and commenced on May 1, 2007. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors, as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions. The notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus a make whole premium, if applicable, and any accrued unpaid interest to the redemption date. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, were $886.1 million. 6.875% Senior Notes Due March 2013 On March 21, 2003, we issued $650.0 million of 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, pay dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and investments, create liens, sell assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The notes are redeemable prior to March 15, 2008, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium (as defined in the indenture) and on or after March 15, 2008, at fixed redemption prices as set forth in the indenture. 5.875% Senior Notes Due March 2016 On March 23, 2004, we completed an offering of $250.0 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due March 2016. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and commenced on April 15, 2004. The notes are guaranteed by our Subsidiary Guarantors as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, pay dividends or make other distributions, make other restricted payments and investments, create liens, sell assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. The notes are redeemable prior to April 15, 2009, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make whole premium (as defined in the indenture) and on or after April 15, 2009, at fixed redemption prices as set forth in the indenture. Net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, were $244.7 million. Series Bonds As of December 31, 2007, we had $74.0 million in Series Bonds outstanding, which were assumed as part of the Excel acquisition. The 6.84% Series A Bonds have a balloon maturity in December 2014. The 6.34% Series B Bonds mature in December 2014 and are payable in installments beginning December 2008. The 6.84% Series C Bonds mature in December 2016 and are payable in installments beginning December 2012. Interest payments are scheduled to occur in June and December of each year. 69 Interest Rate Swaps As of December 31, 2007, we had entered into a series of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of $120.0 million. Under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate of 6.875% and pay a weighted average floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%, which resets each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15. The swaps have been designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013. We have also entered into another series of fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a notional principal amount of $100.0 million. Under the terms of these swaps we receive a fixed rate of 5.875% and pay a weighted average floating rate of LIBOR plus 0.25%, which resets each April 15 and October 15. This series of swaps has been designated as a hedge of the changes in the fair value of the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. In conjunction with the Term Loan Facility, we have a floating to fixed interest rate swap in place for a notional principal amount of $120.0 million. Under the terms of this swap we receive a floating rate of LIBOR plus 1.0% and pay a fixed rate of 6.25%. This interest rate swap was designated as a hedge of the variable interest payments on the Term Loan under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Because the critical terms of the swaps and the respective debt instruments they hedge coincide, there was no hedge ineffectiveness recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 there was an unrealized loss related to the cash flow hedge of $6.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007, there was a net unrealized gain on the fair value hedges of $1.6 million. At December 31, 2006, the net unrealized loss on the fair value hedges was $13.8 million. The fair value hedge is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying value of the Senior Notes (see table above). Third party Security Ratings The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB rating and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on our Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B rating and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement On July 28, 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we can file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. The Debentures, 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Excel Transaction In October 2006, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel) for US$1.54 billion in cash plus assumed debt of US$293.0 million, less US$30.0 million of cash acquired in the transaction. This acquisition was financed with borrowings under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and Senior Notes due 2016 and 2026 (see Note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the financing of the Excel acquisition). The Excel acquisition included three operating mines and three development stage mines (all of which are 70 operating as of December 31, 2007), with up to 500 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves. The results of operations of Excel are included in our Australian Mining Operations segment from October 2006. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (see Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Excel acquisition). Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,781,312 $ 344,324 $ 471,852 $ 825,632 $ 4,139,504 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 116,861 17,349 34,258 30,234 35,020 Operating lease obligations 359,045 85,356 120,218 71,759 81,712 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 168,923 168,923 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 383,416 187,946 139,564 12,777 43,129 Other long term liabilities(2) 1,302,039 112,418 215,443 210,275 763,903 Total contractual cash obligations $ 8,111,596 $ 916,316 $ 981,335 $ 1,150,677 $ 5,063,268 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2007, we had $67.8 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $301.6 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next three years. Total capital expenditures for 2008 are expected to range from $350 million to $400 million, excluding federal coal reserve lease payments, and relate to replacement, improvement, or expansion of existing mines, particularly in Australia, the El Segundo mine development in New Mexico, and growth initiatives such as increasing capacity in the Powder River Basin. Capital expenditures were funded primarily through operating cash flow. Our subsidiary, Peabody Pacific, has committed to pay up to a maximum of A$0.20/tonne (approximately US$0.15/tonne) of coal sales for a period of five years to the Australian COAL21 Fund. The COAL21 Fund is a voluntary coal industry fund to support clean coal technology demonstration projects and research in Australia. All major coal companies in Australia have committed to this fund. The commitment to pay started on April 1, 2007 with a levy of A$0.10/tonne of coal sales. This levy rose to A$0.20/tonne on July 1, 2007. We do not expect any of the $152.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. 71 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (i.e. self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, postretirement benefits and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2007: Workers Retiree Reclamation Lease Compensation Healthcare Obligations Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self Bonding $ 640.6 $ $ $ $ $ 640.6 Surety Bonds 418.3 73.0 31.2 16.7 539.2 Letters of Credit 1.6 102.7 41.4 267.9 413.6 $ 1,060.5 $ 73.0 $ 133.9 $ 41.4 $ 284.6 $ 1,593.4 (1) Includes financial guarantees primarily related to joint venture debt, the PBGC and collateral for surety companies. As part of arrangements through which we obtain exclusive sales representation agreements with small coal mining companies (the Counterparties), we issued financial guarantees on behalf of the Counterparties. These guarantees facilitate the Counterparties efforts to obtain bonding or financing. In 2007, we purchased approximately 345 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands in the Illinois Basin. In conjunction with this purchase, we agreed to provide up to $64.8 million of reclamation and bonding commitments to a third party coal company. We have recognized the full amount of these commitments as a liability as of December 31, 2007. The non cash portion of this transaction was excluded from the investing section of the statement of cash flows. In the event of default, the terms of our guarantees provide for multiple recourse options, including the ability to assume the loans and procure title and use of the equipment purchased through the loans. If default occurs, we have the ability and intent to exercise our recourse options, so the liability associated with the guarantee has been valued at zero. The aggregate amount guaranteed for all such Counterparties was $8.8 million at December 31, 2007. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of our guarantees. As part of the Patriot spin off, we agreed to maintain in force several letters of credit that secured Patriot obligations for certain employee benefits and workers compensation obligations. These letters of credit are to be released upon Patriot satisfying the beneficiaries with alternate letters of credit or insurance, which is expected to occur in 2008. If Patriot is unable to satisfy the primary beneficiaries by June 30, 2011, they are then required to provide directly to us a letter of credit in the amount of the remaining obligation. As of December 31, 2007, the amount of letters of credit securing Patriot obligations was $136.8 million. Under our accounts receivable securitization program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $11.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The securitization program is scheduled to expire in September 2009. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the 72 consolidated balance sheets. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $275.0 million and $219.2 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounts receivable securitization). The following is a summary of specified types of commercial commitments available to us as of December 31, 2007: Expiration Per Year Total Amounts Within Over Committed 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years (Dollars in thousands) Lines of credit and or standby letters of credit $ 1,800,000 $ $ $ 1,800,000 $ Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN No. 48). This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, and as a result, reported $135.0 million of net unrecognized tax benefits ($144.0 million gross) in our consolidated financial statements. Due to the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset for NOL carryforwards as of January 1, 2007, none of the $135.0 million required an adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158). For fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, SFAS No. 158 required recognition of the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans (an asset for overfunded status or a liability for underfunded status) in a companys balance sheet. In addition, the standard required recognition of actuarial gains and losses, prior service cost, and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS No. 106) when determining a plans funded status, with a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We adopted SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006, and as a result, recorded a noncurrent liability of $376.1 million, which reflected the total underfunded status of the pension, retiree healthcare and workers compensation plans. The funded status of each plan was measured as the difference between the fair value of the assets and the projected benefit obligation (the funded status). SFAS No. 158 did not impact net income. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, and therefore does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008 for the Company). In February 2008, the FASB amended SFAS No. 157 to exclude leasing transactions and to delay the effective date by one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on our financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 73 provides all entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (January 1, 2008 for the Company). We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for (1) noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and (2) the loss of control of subsidiaries. SFAS No. 160 requires noncontrolling interests (minority interests) to be reported as a separate component of equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. SFAS No. 160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for the Company). Early adoption is not allowed. We are in the process of determining the effect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141(R) significantly changes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. This statement also provides guidance for the recognition and measurement of goodwill acquired in a business combination and for determination of required disclosures that will enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (January 1, 2009 for the Company). We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The potential for changes in the market value of our coal, freight and emissions allowance trading, fuel, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal, freight and emissions allowance trading portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading fuel, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter, exchange based and direct trading of coal, freight and emission allowances (collectively coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the 74 potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to both swaps and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes 5 and 15 day holding periods, as applicable, and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our value at risk measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate our value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the combined actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $1.2 million, $13.7 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. Our value at risk increased over the prior year due to greater price volatility in the coal markets, particularly in the international markets into which we have recently expanded. As of December 31, 2007, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Percentage Year of Expiration of Portfolio 2008 58 % 2009 41 % 2010 0 % 2011 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Credit Risk Our concentration of credit risk is substantially with energy producers and marketers and electric utilities. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we will protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide appropriate credit enhancement. In general, increases in coal price volatility and our own trading activity resulted in greater exposure to our coal trading counterparties during the year. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Counterparty risk with respect to interest rate swap and foreign currency forwards and options transactions is not considered to be significant based upon the creditworthiness of the participating financial institutions. 75 Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2008 targets hedging at least approximately 70% of our anticipated, non capital Australian dollar denominated expenditures. As of December 31, 2007, we had in place forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts outstanding totaling A$2.03 billion of which A$1.08 billion, A$556.7 million, and A$388.8 million will expire in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in Operating costs and expenses due to a $0.01 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $12 million for 2008. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $1.6 million in 2008. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.57 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $707.2 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $7.1 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $0.3 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 94% and 90% of our sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we had 5 to 10 million tons of expected U.S. production unpriced for 2008. We had 9 to 10 million tons remaining to be priced for 2008 in Australia at December 31, 2007. We have approximately 80 to 90 million tons of expected U.S. production unpriced for 2009, with an additional 17 to 20 million tons of expected Australia coal production unpriced for 2009. Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. As of December 31, 2007, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel and explosives. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts were 114.8 million gallons of crude oil scheduled to expire through 2010. We expect to consume 125 to 130 million gallons of fuel next year. A one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $2.4 million. Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts, scheduled to expire through 2010, were 5.7 mmbtu of natural gas. We expect to consume 315,000 to 325,000 tons of explosives per year. Through our natural gas hedge contracts, we have fixed prices for approximately 49% of our anticipated explosives requirements for 2008. Based on our expected usage, a change in natural gas prices of ten cents per mmbtu (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our operating costs of approximately $0.6 million per year.
