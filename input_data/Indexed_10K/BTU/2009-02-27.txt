Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Share Repurchases Share Repurchase Program In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, approximately 13 million shares. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In addition, our Board of Directors had previously authorized our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside the share repurchase program. In October 2008, our Board of Directors amended the share repurchase program to increase the total authorized amount to $1 billion. The amended repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Share repurchases made by us under this program in the year ended December 31, 2008 totaled 5.5 million shares for $199.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, there was $700.4 million available for share repurchases under the program. The following table summarizes the share repurchases for the three months ended December 31, 2008: Maximum Dollar Value that May Total Number of Yet Be Used to Total Shares Purchased Repurchase Shares Number of Average as Part of Publicly Under the Publically Shares Price per Announced Announced Program Period Purchased Share Program (In millions) October 1 through October 31, 2008 4,332,106 $ 32.66 4,332,106 $ 700.4 November 1 through November 30, 2008 700.4 December 1 through December 31, 2008 700.4 Total 4,332,106 $ 32.66 4,332,106 44 Table of Contents Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected financial and other data about us for the most recent five fiscal years. The following table and the discussion of our results of operations in 2008 and 2007 in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations those operations recently divested, as well as certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets. In October 2006, we acquired Excel and our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the results of operations of the three operating mines and three development stage mines (all of which are operating as of December 31, 2008) in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia from the date of acquisition. On April 15, 2004, we acquired three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the results of operations of the two mines in Queensland, Australia and the results of operations of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado from the April 15, 2004 purchase date. We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004 from our audited financial statements. You should read the following table in 45 Table of Contents conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of operations for the historical periods included in the following table are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods. In addition, the Risk Factors section of Item 1A of this report includes a discussion of risk factors that could impact our future results of operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 30 coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions, except Appalachia, and international interests in Australia and Venezuela. In 2008, we produced 223.7 million tons of coal and sold 255.5 million tons of coal. Our U.S. sales represented 18% of U.S. coal consumption and were approximately 30% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. U.S. coal consumption was approximately 1.1 billion tons in 2008, based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Coal is primarily used for baseload electricity requirements. In 2008, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 50%. Between 2007 and 2030, the EIA projects coal based electricity generation to grow 19%, outpacing all other primary fuel sources, representing 164 million tons of additional coal demand. During that same time frame, new coal to liquids facilities for both heat and power and liquids production is projected by the EIA to add another 70 million tons of coal demand. Coal production is expected to shift to western and interior U.S. locations to offset Appalachian declines. Specifically, production from facilities located west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth, comprising a 61% share of total production in 2030 versus 58% in 2007. Global coal consumption has grown faster than any other fuel, averaging nearly 5% per year between 2000 and 2007. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects demand for coal will rise more than any other fuel in absolute terms, accounting for over a third of the increase in energy use between 2006 and 2030. China and India combined represent 85% of the projected increase in world coal demand. Most of the increase in demand for coal comes from the power generation sector. Global electricity generation is projected by the IEA to rise 76% from 18,921 terawatt hours in 2006 to 33,265 terawatt hours in 2030. The IEA estimates 613 gigawatts of new power generating capacity is under construction around the world, approximately one third of which is coal based. The IEA expects coal to remain the main fuel for power generation worldwide, comprising 44% of the generation mix in 2030 versus 41% in 2006. In total, the IEA projects global primary coal demand will increase 61%, or approximately 2.6 billion tonnes by 2030. For the year ended December 31, 2008, 82% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 16% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2008, approximately 90% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by the recent economic downturn, poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at 47 Table of Contents mining locations and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations and are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Geologically, the Western U.S. Mining operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations and are characterized by a mix of surface and underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Geologically, the Midwestern U.S. Mining operations mine bituminous coal deposits. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as steam coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a small portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produced approximately 4.8 million tons of steam coal in 2008 for export to the U.S. and Europe. During 2008, the Paso Diablo Mine contributed $5.7 million to segment Adjusted EBITDA in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and paid a dividend of $19.9 million. At December 31, 2008, our investment in Paso Diablo was $54.2 million. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 3% of our total sales volume, but represents a larger share of our revenue, approximately 23% in 2008. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 90% of revenues in 2008, we generate revenues and additional cash flows from our Trading and Brokerage segment (9% of revenues) and other activities, including transactions utilizing our vast natural resource position (selling non core land holdings and mineral interests). We also continue to pursue development of coal fueled generating and Btu Conversion projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. Coal fueled generating projects may involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. Currently, we own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. The long term demand for oil and natural gas around the world is expected to lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel. We are exploring Btu Conversion projects designed to expand the uses of coal through coal to liquids and coal gasification technologies. Currently, we are pursuing development of a coal to gas facility in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The facility, known as Kentucky NewGas, is a planned mine mouth gasification project using ConocoPhillips proprietary E Gas(tm) technology to produce clean synthesis gas with carbon storage potential. The plant, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of 48 Table of Contents each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. We also own a minority interest in GreatPoint Energy, Inc., which is commercializing its coal to pipeline quality natural gas technology. We are participating in the advancement of clean coal technologies, including carbon capture and storage, in the U.S., China and Australia. We are a founding member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non profit company working in partnership with the U.S. DOE, which under its new configuration, would develop multiple carbon capture and storage sites. We are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, a near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage. And in Australia, we made a 10 year commitment to fund the Australian COAL21 Fund designed to support clean coal technology demonstration projects and research in Australia. Results of Operations The results of operations for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets and operations recently divested. Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Summary Higher average sales prices and volumes across all operating regions, particularly in Australia, contributed to a 45.1% increase in revenues to $6.59 billion. Segment Adjusted EBITDA rose 94.3% to $2.09 billion primarily on the higher pricing mentioned above and favorable results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales prices and volumes were partially offset by higher commodity, material, supply, sales related and labor costs in all operating regions. Income from continuing operations was $984.8 million in 2008, or $3.63 per diluted share, 123.8% above 2007 income from continuing operations of $440.0 million, or $1.63 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 169.7 161.4 8.3 5.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 30.7 29.6 1.1 3.7 % Australian Mining 23.9 21.0 2.9 13.8 % Trading and Brokerage 31.2 24.1 7.1 29.5 % Total tons sold 255.5 236.1 19.4 8.2 % 49 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,533.1 $ 2,063.2 $ 469.9 22.8 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,154.6 987.1 167.5 17.0 % Australian Mining 2,275.2 1,138.9 1,136.3 99.8 % Trading and Brokerage 601.8 320.7 281.1 87.7 % Other 28.7 35.2 (6.5 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,593.4 $ 4,545.1 $ 2,048.3 45.1 % Total revenues increased in 2008 compared to the prior year across all operating segments. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: An increase in average sales price at our Australian Mining operations (75.6%), primarily driven by the strength of metallurgical coal prices on our Australia contracts that reprice annually in the second quarter of each year. U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (15.2%) driven by the benefit of higher priced coal supply agreements signed in recent years. Australias volumes increased over the prior year (13.8%) from strong demand during the first three quarters of 2008 and additional production from recently completed mines. Year over year increases were partially offset by heavy rainfall and flooding in Queensland during the first quarter of 2008 and customer shipment deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic slowdown. Increased demand also led to higher volumes across our U.S. operating segments, which overcame slightly lower volumes at some of our Midwestern U.S. Mining surface operations due to poor weather in that operating region that impacted production during the first and second quarters. The volume increase of 5.1% at our Western U.S. Mining operations resulted from greater throughput from capital improvements and contributions from our new El Segundo Mine, partially offset by the flooding in the midwestern U.S. that impacted railroad shipping performance related to western U.S. production during the second quarter of 2008. Trading and Brokerage operations revenues increased over the prior year due to increased trading positions allowing us to capture market movements derived from the volatility of both domestic and international coal markets. Also impacting year over year revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations was an agreement to recover previously recognized postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs of $56.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. The agreement is discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 681.3 $ 595.4 $ 85.9 14.4 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 177.3 200.0 (22.7 ) (11.4 )% Australian Mining 1,017.0 166.1 850.9 512.3 % Trading and Brokerage 218.9 116.6 102.3 87.7 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.5 $ 1,078.1 $ 1,016.4 94.3 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2008 over the prior year primarily driven by an overall increase in average sales prices per ton across the region ($2.10) and higher volumes in the region due to increased demand and greater throughput as a result of capital improvements. Also contributing to the increase was the recovery of postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs discussed above. Partially offsetting the pricing and volume contributions were higher per ton costs ($1.78). The cost increases were primarily due to higher sales related costs, higher material, supply and labor costs, higher repair and maintenance costs in the Powder River Basin and increased commodity costs, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives pricing. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2008 as increases in average sales price per ton ($4.22) were offset by cost increases resulting from higher costs for commodities, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives prices, as well as higher material, supply and labor costs. Heavy rains and flooding in the midwestern U.S. affected sales volume at some of our mines, particularly in the first half of the year. Also affecting the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment was the decrease in revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants in the prior year ($28.9 million) due to the producers exiting the synthetic fuel market after expiration of federal tax credits at the end of 2007. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 primarily due to higher pricing negotiated in the second quarter of 2008 ($40.86 per ton), higher overall volumes as a result of strong export demand and contributions from our recently completed mines, and lower demurrage costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher fuel costs, an increase in labor and overburden removal expenses and higher contractor costs (five of ten Australian mines are managed utilizing contract miners). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 over the prior year due to increased trading volumes and higher coal price volatility. 51 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.5 $ 1,078.1 $ 1,016.4 94.3 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (247.2 ) (109.5 ) (137.7 ) (125.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (406.2 ) (352.2 ) (54.0 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.2 ) (23.7 ) (24.5 ) (103.4 )% Interest expense (226.2 ) (235.0 ) 8.8 3.7 % Interest income 10.1 7.1 3.0 42.3 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,176.8 $ 364.8 $ 812.0 222.6 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests increased over the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, and higher asset retirement obligation expense. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. The decrease in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the following: Higher selling and administrative expenses ($54.7 million) primarily driven by an increase in performance based incentive costs and legal expenses; Cost reimbursement and partner fees received in the prior year for the Prairie State project, primarily related to the entrance of new project partners ($29.5 million); Lower net gains on disposals or exchanges of assets ($15.7 million). 2008 activity included a gain of $54.0 million on the sale of approximately 58 million tons of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. 2007 activity included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of oil and gas rights and assets in more than 860,000 acres in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for coal reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. The prior year also included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands to the Prairie State equity partners; and Lower equity income ($15.5 million) from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela) and higher costs associated with Btu Conversion activities of $14.3 million in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was higher in 2008 compared to the prior year because of increased depletion across our operating platform resulting from the volume increases and the impact of mining higher value coal reserves. In addition, depreciation and depletion increases resulted from our recently completed Australian mines and depletion at our El Segundo Mine. Asset retirement obligation expense increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to an increase in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates that reflect higher fuel, labor and re vegetation costs, as well as an overall increase in the number of acres disturbed. The addition of the El Segundo Mine, which was completed in June 2008, also contributed to higher asset retirement obligation expense. 52 Table of Contents Net Income The following table presents net income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,176.8 $ 364.8 $ 812.0 222.6 % Income tax (provision) benefit (185.8 ) 72.9 (258.7 ) (354.9 )% Minority interests (6.2 ) 2.3 (8.5 ) (369.6 )% Income from continuing operations 984.8 440.0 544.8 123.8 % Loss from discontinued operations (31.3 ) (175.7 ) 144.4 82.2 % Net income $ 953.5 $ 264.3 $ 689.2 260.8 % Net income increased in 2008 compared to the prior year due to the increase in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes and minority interests discussed above. The tax provision increase over the prior year is the result of the current year increased pre tax earnings ($292.6 million) combined with the valuation allowance release against federal net operating loss credits recognized into income in the prior year ($197.8 million). These increases were partially offset by the non cash tax benefit from the remeasurement of non U.S. dollar denominated income tax accounts as a result of the strengthening of the Australian dollar in 2007 as compared to weakening of the Australian dollar in 2008 ($121.3 million), the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income ($110.8 million) and the release of a valuation allowance against a portion of our Australia net operating loss carryforwards in the current year ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a lower loss from discontinued operations as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred for Patriot operations in 2007. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 related to operating losses, net of a gain on sale of assets previously held for sale ($19.6 million) and an $11.7 million write off of an excise tax refund receivable (net of tax) as a result of an April 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Summary Higher average sales prices across all U.S. regions and increased volumes, primarily from Australian Mining operations, contributed to a 12.2% increase in revenues to $4.55 billion compared to 2006. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.8% to $1.08 billion primarily on higher prices in the Western U.S. Mining operations and increased results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues, higher commodity costs, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar. Also, negatively impacting Australian Mining results was lower metallurgical coal prices associated with annual contracts that began in April 2007. Income from continuing operations was $440.0 million in 2007, or $1.63 per diluted share, a decrease of 22.8% from 2006 income from continuing operations of $569.9 million, or $2.12 per diluted share. 53 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2007 2006 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 161.4 160.5 0.9 0.6 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 29.6 28.7 0.9 3.1 % Australian Mining 21.0 10.8 10.2 94.4 % Trading and Brokerage 24.1 21.4 2.7 12.6 % Total tons sold 236.1 221.4 14.7 6.6 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,063.2 $ 1,703.4 $ 359.8 21.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 987.1 858.5 128.6 15.0 % Australian Mining 1,138.9 833.0 305.9 36.7 % Trading and Brokerage 320.7 652.0 (331.3 ) (50.8 )% Other 35.2 4.0 31.2 780.0 % Total revenues $ 4,545.1 $ 4,050.9 $ 494.2 12.2 % Total revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 across all mining operations. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: Prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased due to a sales realization increase of approximately 29% for our premium Powder River Basin product and an average increase across all U.S. regions of 16%. Midwestern U.S. Mining revenues increased due to higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants as those plants were idled for part of 2006. Increased volumes from our Australian Mining operations. Volumes related to operations acquired in the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 10.9 million tons of the increase to tons sold. Offsetting this increase was lower average sales prices in our Australian Mining operations related to lower metallurgical contract pricing and a significant change in sales mix resulting in higher thermal export and domestic product sales. Volumes were unfavorably impacted at some of our Australian Mining operations as a result of damaged rails and further amplified port and rail congestion throughout the year, in addition to adverse weather events that affected production. Partially offsetting sales price and volume increases was the continued shift towards trading contracts versus brokerage contracts in our Trading and Brokerage operations. Trading and Brokerage operations sales decreased during 2007 as the amount of brokerage business was reduced and replacement business was in the form of traded contracts. Contracts for trading activity are recorded at net margin in other revenues, whereas contracts for brokerage activity are recorded at gross sales price to revenues and operating costs. 54 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 595.4 $ 473.1 $ 122.3 25.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 200.0 186.2 13.8 7.4 % Australian Mining 166.1 286.8 (120.7 ) (42.1 )% Trading and Brokerage 116.6 92.6 24.0 25.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,078.1 $ 1,038.7 $ 39.4 3.8 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2007 over 2006 primarily related to the overall increase in average sales prices from our Powder River Basin operations. Partially offsetting higher average sales prices were higher costs associated with equipment repairs and maintenance and higher add on taxes and royalties driven by higher sales prices compared to the prior year, mine shutdown for maintenance in our Colorado mine, higher fuel costs and adverse weather conditions in the Powder River Basin and capital project delays. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2007 over 2006 as both volumes and prices per ton saw moderate increases. Results improved compared to 2006 as benefits of higher volumes and sales prices were offset by higher costs for commodities, including fuel. The 2007 results were also positively impacted by higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel facilities of $12.5 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants for a portion of 2006. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to approximately $31 million of higher costs resulting from the weakening U.S. dollar (higher costs of approximately $112 million were offset by hedging gains of $81 million); higher congestion related demurrage costs (approximately $50 million); lower pricing on annually repriced metallurgical coal contracts; and, rail and port congestion at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and the Port of Newcastle. Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal had been experiencing queues of over 41 vessels (approximately a 24 day load time) down from 50 vessels in the second quarter (approximately a 34 day delay). Partially offsetting these decreases were the full year contributions from our mines acquired in the Excel acquisition and a $6.3 million insurance recovery on a business interruption claim in the first half of 2007. Our Australian mines acquired in 2006 experienced shipping difficulties and damaged rail lines resulting from a storm late in 2007. The Port of Newcastle was closed for several days in 2007 due to a storm, with up to 79 vessels in the queue (a 35 40 day wait). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2007 over 2006 as the results reflected higher international trading gains, resulting from higher volumes and pricing due to expanded global trading activities, strong supply/demand fundamentals and tightened seaborne market conditions. 55 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,078.1 $ 1,038.7 $ 39.4 3.8 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (109.5 ) (127.7 ) 18.2 14.3 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (352.2 ) (284.2 ) (68.0 ) (23.9 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (23.7 ) (14.2 ) (9.5 ) (66.9 )% Interest expense (235.0 ) (139.1 ) (95.9 ) (68.9 )% Interest income 7.1 11.3 (4.2 ) (37.2 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 364.8 $ 484.8 $ (120.0 ) (24.8 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests in 2007 was lower than 2006 primarily due to higher interest expense and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the acquisition of Excel in late 2006. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development, Btu Conversion development and resource management. The improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA in 2007 compared to 2006 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $35.1 million. The 2007 activity included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves to the Prairie State equity partners. Our 2007 activity also included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of our coalbed methane and oil and gas rights in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for high Btu coal reserves located in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. In comparison, the 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million; Higher past mining obligation expenses of $15.5 million resulting from increased retiree healthcare costs due to higher than anticipated healthcare utilization by retirees, particularly related to prescription drugs; Higher selling and administrative expenses of $19.1 million primarily resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and other corporate development initiatives; and Lower equity income of $6.8 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela), which primarily resulted from trucking issues experienced earlier in the year, a temporary shortage of explosives and delays in receiving equipment, which impacted operations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $68.0 million primarily related to the addition of the Australian operations acquired in late 2006. Interest expense increased $95.9 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion in new debt issued or assumed as part of the Excel acquisition in the second half of 2006. 56 Table of Contents Net Income The following table presents net income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 364.8 $ 484.8 $ (120.0 ) (24.8 )% Income tax benefit 72.9 85.7 (12.8 ) (14.9 )% Minority interests 2.3 (0.6 ) 2.9 483.3 % Income from continuing operations 440.0 569.9 (129.9 ) (22.8 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations (175.7 ) 30.8 (206.5 ) (670.5 )% Net income $ 264.3 $ 600.7 $ (336.4 ) (56.0 )% Income from continuing operations decreased in 2007 compared to prior year due to the decrease in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and a lower income tax benefit compared to 2006. The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended 2007 related primarily to a $56.0 million foreign currency impact on deferred taxes as a result of increases in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rates and $33.2 million lower tax reserves than in 2006. This decrease was partially offset by lower pre tax income, a $10.3 million increase in released valuation allowances and $24.3 million of additional tax credits. Minority interests increased primarily from the absorption of losses in excess of the minority interest capital contribution at one of our mines, partially offset by lower earnings allocable to partners. Outlook Near Term Outlook The current global financial slowdown has reduced gross domestic product expectations for U.S., China and other major world economies, which is expected to temper the growth of coal demand in the near term. As a result, we expect our 2009 prices to be lower than 2008 levels for our unpriced 2009 Australian based metallurgical and thermal coal (see further discussion of unpriced coal below). Fourth quarter 2008 global steel production declined 19% compared to fourth quarter 2007 due to the softening worldwide economies. Steel production in 2009 is anticipated to be as much as 20% lower than 2008. We estimate lower steel production will reduce 2009 seaborne metallurgical coal demand up to 40 million metric tonnes. In response to expected declines in demand, met coal producers have been reducing planned production levels. As of January 2009, approximately 30 million metric tonnes of seaborne met coal production cuts have been announced. In January 2009, we announced planned production cuts of up to 2 million tons of Australian based metallurgical coal to match expected changes in demand due to the global recession. As of January 2009, we have 4 to 5 million tons of expected Australian based metallurgical coal production available to be priced for the last three quarters of 2009. By the end of 2008, published thermal coal prices in most major markets declined from their mid 2008 highs, largely reversing gains from the first half of 2008. The decline was initiated by the accelerated liquidation of positions by financial counterparties that was followed by mild weather across the northern hemisphere during the third quarter of 2008 and the onset of the global economic downturn over the second half of the year. As of January 2009, we have 5 to 6 million tons of Australian based thermal coal available to be priced for the last three quarters of 2009. In the U.S., declining gross domestic product is expected to lead to reduced electricity demand for 2009. In addition, higher than normal stockpiles, low natural gas prices and lower U.S. exports could dampen 2009 U.S. coal demand by up to 60 to 70 million tons. U.S. coal production is adjusting to anticipated changes in 57 Table of Contents demand, with approximately 40 million tons of announced production cuts from 50% of the U.S. production base as of January 2009. In January 2009, we announced planned reductions in 2009 Powder River Basin production of 10 million tons to better match production with expected demand. Our U.S. production is largely sold out for 2009. We are targeting full year 2009 production of 190 to 195 million tons in the U.S. and 22 to 24 million tons in Australia with total sales in the range of 230 to 250 million tons. We rely on ongoing access to the worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. We continue to manage costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We have experienced increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs, including a company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Long term Outlook Given the current global economic conditions, the near term is less certain. However, our long term outlook remains positive. Coal has been the fastest growing fuel for each of the past five years, with consumption growing nearly twice as fast as total energy use. The IEAs World Energy Outlook estimates world primary energy demand will grow 45% between 2006 and 2030, with demand for coal rising more than any other fuel and comprising more than a third of the expected increase in energy use. China and India alone account for more than half of the expected incremental energy demand. Currently, 200 gigawatts of coal fired electricity generating plants are under construction around the world, representing nearly 700 million tons of annual coal demand expected to come online in the next several years. In the U.S., 30 units are currently under construction in 19 states, representing more than 16 gigawatts of capacity and approximately 70 million tons of annual coal demand. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as coal to gas (CTG) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants represent a significant avenue for potential long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including CTL, which is estimated to add 70 million tons of annual U.S. coal demand by 2030. In addition, China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. We continue to support clean coal technology development and voluntary initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation as a founding member of the FutureGen Alliance and the Australian COAL21 Fund, and through our participation in the Power Systems Development Facility, the PowerTree Carbon Company LLC, the Midwest Geopolitical Sequestration Consortium and the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate. In addition, we are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, a planned near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage which is under development in China. 58 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $74.4 million, while funding payments were $89.5 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 6.6 $ (5.7 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 79.7 $ (68.5 ) Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.8 $ (0.8 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (39.1 ) $ 41.1 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 10.68 years at December 31, 2008. 59 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $48.2 million, and payments totaled $11.4 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Interpretation No. 48 (FIN No. 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the effect of income taxes. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 92% of our revenue in 2008 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Under the typical terms of our coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal, freight and emissions allowances, both in over the counter markets and on exchanges. Under the provision of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, all derivative coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value (as defined by SFAS No. 157) basis, except those that qualify for and the Company has elected to apply a normal purchases and normal sales exception. For certain of our derivative coal trading contracts, we establish fair values using bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal, freight and 60 Table of Contents emission allowance positions from the over the counter market. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. For our exchange based positions, we utilize published settlement prices. Non derivative coal contracts, including those that qualify for and the Company has elected to apply a normal purchases and normal sales exception, are accounted for on an accrual basis. As of December 31, 2008, 94% of the contracts in our trading portfolio were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials. As of December 31, 2008, 75% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2009 and 88% within 24 months. See Note 3 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Fair Value Measurements We use various methods to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using market quoted inputs for valuation or corroboration as available. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the particular asset or liability, including assumptions about inherent risk. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements utilizing the best available information. We consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three hierarchy levels, Level 1, 2 and 3, as prescribed by SFAS No. 157 (see Note 3 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those which our positions extend out to periods where there is low trade activity or where broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include quotes from one to three reputable brokers where forward pricing curves are projected. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts, which are categorized by level in the table below. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. Net assets (liabilities) related to coal trading activities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: December 31, Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Level 1 $ (17.0 ) $ 5.9 $ (22.9 ) Level 2 337.8 (86.6 ) 424.4 Level 3 37.8 128.7 (90.9 ) Total $ 358.6 $ 48.0 $ 310.6 61 Table of Contents Our coal trading platform includes positions designed to secure forward pricing for some of our production (i.e. cash flow hedges wherein the effective portion of the change in the fair value is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until the hedged transaction occurs) as well as positions designed to generate current period trading results. Overall pricing increases since December 31, 2007 and higher trading volumes, particularly from our international trading activities, have increased the value of our coal trading portfolio during 2008. As a result, segment Adjusted EBITDA from our Trading and Brokerage segment totaled $218.9 million compared to $116.6 million in 2007. The fair value of coal trading positions designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated future sales was an asset of $220.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and a liability of $44.1 million as of December 31, 2007 (primarily classified as Level 2). The estimated realization of our aggregate coal trading portfolio of $358.6 million is 75% in 2009 and 88% within two years. Level 3 Net Financial Asset (Liability) Detail The Level 3 net financial assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2008 are as follows: Net financial assets (liabilities) (Dollars in millions) Physical commodity purchase/sale contracts coal trading activities $ 38.9 Commodity swaps and options coal trading activities (1.1 ) Total net Level 3 financial assets $ 37.8 Total net financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value $ (129.2 ) Percent of Level 3 net financial assets to total net financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value Not meaningful(1 ) (1) Percentage of Level 3 net financial assets compared to total net financial assets (liabilities) is not meaningful due to overall liability position as of December 31, 2008. The following table summarizes the changes in our recurring Level 3 net financial assets: Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Beginning of period $ 128.7 Total gains or losses (realized/unrealized): Included in earnings (9.8 ) Included in other comprehensive income 3.4 Purchases, issuances and settlements (58.8 ) Net transfers out (25.7 ) December 31, 2008 $ 37.8 The following table summarizes the changes in unrealized gains (losses) relating to Level 3 net financial assets still held as January 1 and December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Changes in unrealized losses(1) $ (34.8 ) (1) For the periods presented, unrealized gains and losses from Level 3 items are offset by unrealized gains and losses on positions classified in Level 1 or 2, as well as other positions that have been realized during the applicable periods. 62 Table of Contents Exploration and Drilling Costs Exploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Advance Stripping Costs Pre production: At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre production box cut to remove overburden (i.e., advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (i.e., advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices. Post production: Advance stripping costs related to post production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, we expense such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which we adopted using the modified prospective option on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123(R), share based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award. We utilize restricted stock, nonqualified stock options, performance units, deferred stock units and an employee stock purchase plan as part of our share based compensation program. Determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions, including items such as expected term, risk free rate, forfeiture rate and expected volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable (through our securitization program). Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, federal coal lease payments, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of our 5.875% and 6.875% Senior Notes and Debentures. We generally fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. We believe our available borrowing capicity and operating cash flows will be sufficient in the near term. As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. Our two defined benefit pension plans, which have approximately 45% of their assets invested in equity securities, experienced negative returns in 2008 due to recent equity market performance. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Protection Act), which was effective January 1, 2008, increased the long term funding targets for single employer pension plans from 90% to 100%. In addition, the Pension Protection 63 Table of Contents Act restricts at risk (generally defined as under 80% funded) plans from making lump sum payments and increasing benefits unless they are funded immediately, and also requires that the plan give participants notice regarding the at risk status of the plan. If a plan falls below 60%, lump sum payments are prohibited and participant benefit accruals cease. As of December 31, 2008, our pension plans were approximately 68% funded, before considering planned 2009 contributions. Our minimum funding requirement for 2009 is approximately $25 million, and would result in a funded status above 70%. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2008 increased $956.1 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily related to a current year increase in operating cash flows generated from our Australian mining operations and the timing of cash flows for working capital driven by an increase in income tax amounts that will be payable in future periods. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased $7.4 million in 2008 compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower capital spending of $160.5 million in 2008, mostly offset by the acquisition of minority interests of $110.1 million relating to our Millennium Mine, and a decrease in cash proceeds of $46.8 million, net of notes receivable, related to asset disposals. Net cash used in financing activities reflects a use of $375.8 million in 2008 compared to $44.7 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2007. The increase in the use of cash in 2008 is primarily due to the repurchase of $199.8 million of our outstanding common stock, $97.7 million to repay the borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility, and debt repayments of $32.7 million, including payments of $18.8 million on our Term Loan under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. During 2007, we repaid $37.9 million of our Term Loan and purchased in the open market $13.8 million face value of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. We also made the final principal payment of $59.5 million on our 5% Subordinated Note. Our Revolving Credit Facility balance increased $97.7 million in 2007 as it was utilized to fund cash contributions to Patriot at the spin off date. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 consisted of the following: December 31, 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 490.3 $ 509.1 Revolving Credit Facility 97.7 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 732.5 732.5 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 650.0 650.0 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650.0 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 247.0 247.0 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 218.1 218.1 6.84% Series C Bonds due 2016 43.0 43.0 6.34% Series B Bonds due 2014 18.0 21.0 6.84% Series A Bonds due 2014 10.0 10.0 Capital lease obligations 81.2 92.2 Fair value hedge adjustment 15.1 1.6 Other 1.0 0.9 Total $ 3,156.2 $ 3,273.1 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2008. 64 Table of Contents Senior Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2006, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a $2.75 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and which amended and restated in full our then existing $1.35 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Currently, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus 0.75%, which at December 31, 2008 was 2.2%. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The new facility is less restrictive with respect to limitations on our dividend payments, capital expenditures, asset sales or stock repurchases. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2008, we had no borrowings and $245.1 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility is primarily used for standby letters of credit and short term working capital needs. The remaining available borrowing capacity ($1.5 billion as of December 31, 2008) can be used to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs, including additional standby letters of credit. Other Long Term Debt A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Third party Security Ratings The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on our Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement On July 28, 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, 65 Table of Contents debt securities, warrants and units. The Debentures, 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Share Repurchase Program In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, approximately 13 million shares. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In addition, our Board of Directors had previously authorized our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside the repurchase program. In October 2008, our Board of Directors amended the share repurchase program to increase the total authorized amount to $1 billion. The amended repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. In 2008, we repurchased 5.5 million of our common shares for $199.8 million under this repurchase program and in 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares for $99.8 million under this repurchase program. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,356.1 $ 198.5 $ 861.8 $ 1,004.1 $ 3,291.8 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 99.4 19.1 30.2 38.1 12.0 Operating lease obligations 409.2 76.3 132.5 73.6 126.8 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 38.5 38.5 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 193.9 134.1 15.1 11.5 33.2 Other long term liabilities(2) 1,513.1 192.7 216.5 178.2 925.7 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,610.2 $ 659.2 $ 1,256.1 $ 1,305.5 $ 4,389.5 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2008, we had $38.5 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $124.6 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next five years. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures primarily relate to the replacement and improvement of equipment and facilities at existing mines. We expect to fund capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. We do not expect any of the $186.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as 66 Table of Contents bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (such as self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2008: Workers Reclamation Lease Compensation Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self Bonding $ 773.4 $ $ $ $ 773.4 Surety Bonds 740.6 99.2 19.3 15.2 874.3 Letters of Credit 0.1 54.9 199.3 254.3 $ 1,514.1 $ 99.2 $ 74.2 $ 214.5 $ 1,902.0 (1) Other includes the four letter of credit obligations described below and an additional $24.3 million in self bonding, letters of credit and surety bonds related to collateral for surety companies, road maintenance, performance guarantees and other operations. We own a 37.5% interest in a partnership that leases a coal export terminal from the Peninsula Ports Authority of Virginia under a 30 year lease that permits the partnership to purchase the terminal at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount. The partners have severally (but not jointly) agreed to make payments under various agreements which in the aggregate provide the partnership with sufficient funds to pay rents and to cover the principal and interest payments on the floating rate industrial revenue bonds issued by the Peninsula Ports Authority, and which are supported by letters of credit from a commercial bank. As of December 31, 2008, our maximum reimbursement obligation to the commercial bank was in turn supported by two letters of credit totaling $42.8 million. We are party to an agreement with the PBGC and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make special contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.) and continues under this process as of December 31, 2008. As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. At December 31, 2008, we have a $110.4 million letter of credit for collateral for bank guarantees issued with respect to certain reclamation and performance obligations related to the mines acquired in the Excel acquisition. Other Guarantees As part of arrangements through which we obtain exclusive sales representation agreements with small coal mining companies (the Counterparties), we issued financial guarantees on behalf of the Counterparties. These guarantees facilitate the Counterparties efforts to obtain bonding or financing. In the event of default, we have multiple recourse options, including the ability to assume the loans and procure title and use of the equipment purchased through the loans. If default occurs, we have the ability and intent to exercise our recourse options, so the liability associated with the guarantee has been valued at zero. The aggregate amount 67 Table of Contents guaranteed by us for all such Counterparties was $10.0 million at December 31, 2008. Our obligations under the guarantees extend to September 2013. As part of the Patriot spin off, we agreed to maintain several letters of credit that secured Patriot obligations for certain employee benefits and workers compensation obligations. These letters of credit are to be released upon Patriot satisfying the beneficiaries with alternate letters of credit or insurance. If Patriot is unable to satisfy the primary beneficiaries by June 30, 2011, they are then required to provide directly to us a letter of credit in the amount of the remaining obligation. The amount of letters of credit maintained by us securing Patriot obligations was $7.0 million at December 31, 2008 and $136.8 million at December 31, 2007. Under our accounts receivable securitization program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The securitization program and the underlying facilities will effectively expire in May 2009. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $275.0 million as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounts receivable securitization). Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, emission allowances, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal and ocean freight. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified 68 Table of Contents confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to option, swap and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. During 2008, we implemented a change to our volatility calculation by incorporating an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days. This algorithm makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our value at risk measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the combined actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $8.5 million, $27.2 million, and $19.1 million, respectively. Our value at risk increased over the prior year due to greater price volatility in the eastern U.S. and international coal markets. As of December 31, 2008, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage Expiration of Portfolio 2009 75 % 2010 13 % 2011 11 % 2012 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Performance and Credit Risk Our concentration of performance and credit risk is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. In general, increases in coal price volatility and our own trading activity resulted in greater exposure to our coal trading counterparties during 2008. In addition to credit risk, performance risk includes the possibility that a counterparty fails to deliver agreed production or trading volumes. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include 69 Table of Contents obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into agreements that include netting language with counterparties that permit us to offset trading positions, receivables, and payables with such counterparties. We conduct our various hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate management, and fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks. In light of the recent turmoil in the financial markets we continue to closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2009 targets hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a five cent change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $84.0 million for 2009. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $25.9 million for 2009. The chart at the end of Item 7A. shows the notional amount of our forward contracts as of December 31, 2008. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.5 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $691.2 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $6.9 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $145.2 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% and 87% of our worldwide sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of January 27, 2009, we have largely sold out expected 2009 U.S. production. We had 9 to 11 million tons remaining to be priced for 2009 in Australia at January 27, 2009. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, which are primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. As of December 31, 2008, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel and explosives. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 125 to 130 million gallons of fuel next year. A $10 dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $31 million. 70 Table of Contents Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the chart below. We expect to consume 335,000 to 345,000 tons of explosives per year in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included with the fees paid to our contract miners. Based on our expected usage, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $7 million.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations those operations recently divested, as well as certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets. In October 2006, we acquired Excel and our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 included the results of operations of the three operating mines and three development stage mines (all of which are operating as of December 31, 2008) in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia from the date of acquisition. On April 15, 2004, we acquired three coal operations from RAG Coal International AG. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 include the results of operations of the two mines in Queensland, Australia and the results of operations of the Twentymile Mine in Colorado from the April 15, 2004 purchase date. We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004 from our audited financial statements. You should read the following table in 45 Table of Contents conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 30 coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions, except Appalachia, and international interests in Australia and Venezuela. In 2008, we produced 223.7 million tons of coal and sold 255.5 million tons of coal. Our U.S. sales represented 18% of U.S. coal consumption and were approximately 30% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. U.S. coal consumption was approximately 1.1 billion tons in 2008, based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Coal is primarily used for baseload electricity requirements. In 2008, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 50%. Between 2007 and 2030, the EIA projects coal based electricity generation to grow 19%, outpacing all other primary fuel sources, representing 164 million tons of additional coal demand. During that same time frame, new coal to liquids facilities for both heat and power and liquids production is projected by the EIA to add another 70 million tons of coal demand. Coal production is expected to shift to western and interior U.S. locations to offset Appalachian declines. Specifically, production from facilities located west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth, comprising a 61% share of total production in 2030 versus 58% in 2007. Global coal consumption has grown faster than any other fuel, averaging nearly 5% per year between 2000 and 2007. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects demand for coal will rise more than any other fuel in absolute terms, accounting for over a third of the increase in energy use between 2006 and 2030. China and India combined represent 85% of the projected increase in world coal demand. Most of the increase in demand for coal comes from the power generation sector. Global electricity generation is projected by the IEA to rise 76% from 18,921 terawatt hours in 2006 to 33,265 terawatt hours in 2030. The IEA estimates 613 gigawatts of new power generating capacity is under construction around the world, approximately one third of which is coal based. The IEA expects coal to remain the main fuel for power generation worldwide, comprising 44% of the generation mix in 2030 versus 41% in 2006. In total, the IEA projects global primary coal demand will increase 61%, or approximately 2.6 billion tonnes by 2030. For the year ended December 31, 2008, 82% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 16% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2008, approximately 90% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by the recent economic downturn, poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at 47 Table of Contents mining locations and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations and are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Geologically, the Western U.S. Mining operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations and are characterized by a mix of surface and underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Geologically, the Midwestern U.S. Mining operations mine bituminous coal deposits. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as steam coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a small portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produced approximately 4.8 million tons of steam coal in 2008 for export to the U.S. and Europe. During 2008, the Paso Diablo Mine contributed $5.7 million to segment Adjusted EBITDA in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and paid a dividend of $19.9 million. At December 31, 2008, our investment in Paso Diablo was $54.2 million. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 3% of our total sales volume, but represents a larger share of our revenue, approximately 23% in 2008. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 90% of revenues in 2008, we generate revenues and additional cash flows from our Trading and Brokerage segment (9% of revenues) and other activities, including transactions utilizing our vast natural resource position (selling non core land holdings and mineral interests). We also continue to pursue development of coal fueled generating and Btu Conversion projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. Coal fueled generating projects may involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. Currently, we own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. The long term demand for oil and natural gas around the world is expected to lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel. We are exploring Btu Conversion projects designed to expand the uses of coal through coal to liquids and coal gasification technologies. Currently, we are pursuing development of a coal to gas facility in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The facility, known as Kentucky NewGas, is a planned mine mouth gasification project using ConocoPhillips proprietary E Gas(tm) technology to produce clean synthesis gas with carbon storage potential. The plant, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of 48 Table of Contents each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. We also own a minority interest in GreatPoint Energy, Inc., which is commercializing its coal to pipeline quality natural gas technology. We are participating in the advancement of clean coal technologies, including carbon capture and storage, in the U.S., China and Australia. We are a founding member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non profit company working in partnership with the U.S. DOE, which under its new configuration, would develop multiple carbon capture and storage sites. We are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, a near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage. And in Australia, we made a 10 year commitment to fund the Australian COAL21 Fund designed to support clean coal technology demonstration projects and research in Australia. Results of Operations The results of operations for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets and operations recently divested. Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Summary Higher average sales prices and volumes across all operating regions, particularly in Australia, contributed to a 45.1% increase in revenues to $6.59 billion. Segment Adjusted EBITDA rose 94.3% to $2.09 billion primarily on the higher pricing mentioned above and favorable results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales prices and volumes were partially offset by higher commodity, material, supply, sales related and labor costs in all operating regions. Income from continuing operations was $984.8 million in 2008, or $3.63 per diluted share, 123.8% above 2007 income from continuing operations of $440.0 million, or $1.63 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 169.7 161.4 8.3 5.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 30.7 29.6 1.1 3.7 % Australian Mining 23.9 21.0 2.9 13.8 % Trading and Brokerage 31.2 24.1 7.1 29.5 % Total tons sold 255.5 236.1 19.4 8.2 % 49 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,533.1 $ 2,063.2 $ 469.9 22.8 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,154.6 987.1 167.5 17.0 % Australian Mining 2,275.2 1,138.9 1,136.3 99.8 % Trading and Brokerage 601.8 320.7 281.1 87.7 % Other 28.7 35.2 (6.5 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,593.4 $ 4,545.1 $ 2,048.3 45.1 % Total revenues increased in 2008 compared to the prior year across all operating segments. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: An increase in average sales price at our Australian Mining operations (75.6%), primarily driven by the strength of metallurgical coal prices on our Australia contracts that reprice annually in the second quarter of each year. U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (15.2%) driven by the benefit of higher priced coal supply agreements signed in recent years. Australias volumes increased over the prior year (13.8%) from strong demand during the first three quarters of 2008 and additional production from recently completed mines. Year over year increases were partially offset by heavy rainfall and flooding in Queensland during the first quarter of 2008 and customer shipment deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic slowdown. Increased demand also led to higher volumes across our U.S. operating segments, which overcame slightly lower volumes at some of our Midwestern U.S. Mining surface operations due to poor weather in that operating region that impacted production during the first and second quarters. The volume increase of 5.1% at our Western U.S. Mining operations resulted from greater throughput from capital improvements and contributions from our new El Segundo Mine, partially offset by the flooding in the midwestern U.S. that impacted railroad shipping performance related to western U.S. production during the second quarter of 2008. Trading and Brokerage operations revenues increased over the prior year due to increased trading positions allowing us to capture market movements derived from the volatility of both domestic and international coal markets. Also impacting year over year revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations was an agreement to recover previously recognized postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs of $56.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. The agreement is discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 681.3 $ 595.4 $ 85.9 14.4 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 177.3 200.0 (22.7 ) (11.4 )% Australian Mining 1,017.0 166.1 850.9 512.3 % Trading and Brokerage 218.9 116.6 102.3 87.7 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.5 $ 1,078.1 $ 1,016.4 94.3 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2008 over the prior year primarily driven by an overall increase in average sales prices per ton across the region ($2.10) and higher volumes in the region due to increased demand and greater throughput as a result of capital improvements. Also contributing to the increase was the recovery of postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs discussed above. Partially offsetting the pricing and volume contributions were higher per ton costs ($1.78). The cost increases were primarily due to higher sales related costs, higher material, supply and labor costs, higher repair and maintenance costs in the Powder River Basin and increased commodity costs, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives pricing. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2008 as increases in average sales price per ton ($4.22) were offset by cost increases resulting from higher costs for commodities, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives prices, as well as higher material, supply and labor costs. Heavy rains and flooding in the midwestern U.S. affected sales volume at some of our mines, particularly in the first half of the year. Also affecting the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment was the decrease in revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants in the prior year ($28.9 million) due to the producers exiting the synthetic fuel market after expiration of federal tax credits at the end of 2007. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 primarily due to higher pricing negotiated in the second quarter of 2008 ($40.86 per ton), higher overall volumes as a result of strong export demand and contributions from our recently completed mines, and lower demurrage costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher fuel costs, an increase in labor and overburden removal expenses and higher contractor costs (five of ten Australian mines are managed utilizing contract miners). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 over the prior year due to increased trading volumes and higher coal price volatility. 51 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.5 $ 1,078.1 $ 1,016.4 94.3 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (247.2 ) (109.5 ) (137.7 ) (125.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (406.2 ) (352.2 ) (54.0 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.2 ) (23.7 ) (24.5 ) (103.4 )% Interest expense (226.2 ) (235.0 ) 8.8 3.7 % Interest income 10.1 7.1 3.0 42.3 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,176.8 $ 364.8 $ 812.0 222.6 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests increased over the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, and higher asset retirement obligation expense. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. The decrease in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the following: Higher selling and administrative expenses ($54.7 million) primarily driven by an increase in performance based incentive costs and legal expenses; Cost reimbursement and partner fees received in the prior year for the Prairie State project, primarily related to the entrance of new project partners ($29.5 million); Lower net gains on disposals or exchanges of assets ($15.7 million). 2008 activity included a gain of $54.0 million on the sale of approximately 58 million tons of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. 2007 activity included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of oil and gas rights and assets in more than 860,000 acres in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for coal reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. The prior year also included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands to the Prairie State equity partners; and Lower equity income ($15.5 million) from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela) and higher costs associated with Btu Conversion activities of $14.3 million in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was higher in 2008 compared to the prior year because of increased depletion across our operating platform resulting from the volume increases and the impact of mining higher value coal reserves. In addition, depreciation and depletion increases resulted from our recently completed Australian mines and depletion at our El Segundo Mine. Asset retirement obligation expense increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to an increase in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates that reflect higher fuel, labor and re vegetation costs, as well as an overall increase in the number of acres disturbed. The addition of the El Segundo Mine, which was completed in June 2008, also contributed to higher asset retirement obligation expense. 52 Table of Contents Net Income The following table presents net income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,176.8 $ 364.8 $ 812.0 222.6 % Income tax (provision) benefit (185.8 ) 72.9 (258.7 ) (354.9 )% Minority interests (6.2 ) 2.3 (8.5 ) (369.6 )% Income from continuing operations 984.8 440.0 544.8 123.8 % Loss from discontinued operations (31.3 ) (175.7 ) 144.4 82.2 % Net income $ 953.5 $ 264.3 $ 689.2 260.8 % Net income increased in 2008 compared to the prior year due to the increase in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes and minority interests discussed above. The tax provision increase over the prior year is the result of the current year increased pre tax earnings ($292.6 million) combined with the valuation allowance release against federal net operating loss credits recognized into income in the prior year ($197.8 million). These increases were partially offset by the non cash tax benefit from the remeasurement of non U.S. dollar denominated income tax accounts as a result of the strengthening of the Australian dollar in 2007 as compared to weakening of the Australian dollar in 2008 ($121.3 million), the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income ($110.8 million) and the release of a valuation allowance against a portion of our Australia net operating loss carryforwards in the current year ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a lower loss from discontinued operations as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred for Patriot operations in 2007. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 related to operating losses, net of a gain on sale of assets previously held for sale ($19.6 million) and an $11.7 million write off of an excise tax refund receivable (net of tax) as a result of an April 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Summary Higher average sales prices across all U.S. regions and increased volumes, primarily from Australian Mining operations, contributed to a 12.2% increase in revenues to $4.55 billion compared to 2006. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.8% to $1.08 billion primarily on higher prices in the Western U.S. Mining operations and increased results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues, higher commodity costs, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar. Also, negatively impacting Australian Mining results was lower metallurgical coal prices associated with annual contracts that began in April 2007. Income from continuing operations was $440.0 million in 2007, or $1.63 per diluted share, a decrease of 22.8% from 2006 income from continuing operations of $569.9 million, or $2.12 per diluted share. 53 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2007 2006 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 161.4 160.5 0.9 0.6 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 29.6 28.7 0.9 3.1 % Australian Mining 21.0 10.8 10.2 94.4 % Trading and Brokerage 24.1 21.4 2.7 12.6 % Total tons sold 236.1 221.4 14.7 6.6 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,063.2 $ 1,703.4 $ 359.8 21.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 987.1 858.5 128.6 15.0 % Australian Mining 1,138.9 833.0 305.9 36.7 % Trading and Brokerage 320.7 652.0 (331.3 ) (50.8 )% Other 35.2 4.0 31.2 780.0 % Total revenues $ 4,545.1 $ 4,050.9 $ 494.2 12.2 % Total revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 across all mining operations. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: Prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased due to a sales realization increase of approximately 29% for our premium Powder River Basin product and an average increase across all U.S. regions of 16%. Midwestern U.S. Mining revenues increased due to higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants as those plants were idled for part of 2006. Increased volumes from our Australian Mining operations. Volumes related to operations acquired in the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 10.9 million tons of the increase to tons sold. Offsetting this increase was lower average sales prices in our Australian Mining operations related to lower metallurgical contract pricing and a significant change in sales mix resulting in higher thermal export and domestic product sales. Volumes were unfavorably impacted at some of our Australian Mining operations as a result of damaged rails and further amplified port and rail congestion throughout the year, in addition to adverse weather events that affected production. Partially offsetting sales price and volume increases was the continued shift towards trading contracts versus brokerage contracts in our Trading and Brokerage operations. Trading and Brokerage operations sales decreased during 2007 as the amount of brokerage business was reduced and replacement business was in the form of traded contracts. Contracts for trading activity are recorded at net margin in other revenues, whereas contracts for brokerage activity are recorded at gross sales price to revenues and operating costs. 54 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 595.4 $ 473.1 $ 122.3 25.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 200.0 186.2 13.8 7.4 % Australian Mining 166.1 286.8 (120.7 ) (42.1 )% Trading and Brokerage 116.6 92.6 24.0 25.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,078.1 $ 1,038.7 $ 39.4 3.8 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2007 over 2006 primarily related to the overall increase in average sales prices from our Powder River Basin operations. Partially offsetting higher average sales prices were higher costs associated with equipment repairs and maintenance and higher add on taxes and royalties driven by higher sales prices compared to the prior year, mine shutdown for maintenance in our Colorado mine, higher fuel costs and adverse weather conditions in the Powder River Basin and capital project delays. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2007 over 2006 as both volumes and prices per ton saw moderate increases. Results improved compared to 2006 as benefits of higher volumes and sales prices were offset by higher costs for commodities, including fuel. The 2007 results were also positively impacted by higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel facilities of $12.5 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants for a portion of 2006. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to approximately $31 million of higher costs resulting from the weakening U.S. dollar (higher costs of approximately $112 million were offset by hedging gains of $81 million); higher congestion related demurrage costs (approximately $50 million); lower pricing on annually repriced metallurgical coal contracts; and, rail and port congestion at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and the Port of Newcastle. Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal had been experiencing queues of over 41 vessels (approximately a 24 day load time) down from 50 vessels in the second quarter (approximately a 34 day delay). Partially offsetting these decreases were the full year contributions from our mines acquired in the Excel acquisition and a $6.3 million insurance recovery on a business interruption claim in the first half of 2007. Our Australian mines acquired in 2006 experienced shipping difficulties and damaged rail lines resulting from a storm late in 2007. The Port of Newcastle was closed for several days in 2007 due to a storm, with up to 79 vessels in the queue (a 35 40 day wait). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2007 over 2006 as the results reflected higher international trading gains, resulting from higher volumes and pricing due to expanded global trading activities, strong supply/demand fundamentals and tightened seaborne market conditions. 55 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,078.1 $ 1,038.7 $ 39.4 3.8 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (109.5 ) (127.7 ) 18.2 14.3 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (352.2 ) (284.2 ) (68.0 ) (23.9 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (23.7 ) (14.2 ) (9.5 ) (66.9 )% Interest expense (235.0 ) (139.1 ) (95.9 ) (68.9 )% Interest income 7.1 11.3 (4.2 ) (37.2 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 364.8 $ 484.8 $ (120.0 ) (24.8 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests in 2007 was lower than 2006 primarily due to higher interest expense and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the acquisition of Excel in late 2006. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development, Btu Conversion development and resource management. The improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA in 2007 compared to 2006 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $35.1 million. The 2007 activity included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves to the Prairie State equity partners. Our 2007 activity also included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of our coalbed methane and oil and gas rights in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for high Btu coal reserves located in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. In comparison, the 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million; Higher past mining obligation expenses of $15.5 million resulting from increased retiree healthcare costs due to higher than anticipated healthcare utilization by retirees, particularly related to prescription drugs; Higher selling and administrative expenses of $19.1 million primarily resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and other corporate development initiatives; and Lower equity income of $6.8 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela), which primarily resulted from trucking issues experienced earlier in the year, a temporary shortage of explosives and delays in receiving equipment, which impacted operations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $68.0 million primarily related to the addition of the Australian operations acquired in late 2006. Interest expense increased $95.9 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion in new debt issued or assumed as part of the Excel acquisition in the second half of 2006. 56 Table of Contents Net Income The following table presents net income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 364.8 $ 484.8 $ (120.0 ) (24.8 )% Income tax benefit 72.9 85.7 (12.8 ) (14.9 )% Minority interests 2.3 (0.6 ) 2.9 483.3 % Income from continuing operations 440.0 569.9 (129.9 ) (22.8 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations (175.7 ) 30.8 (206.5 ) (670.5 )% Net income $ 264.3 $ 600.7 $ (336.4 ) (56.0 )% Income from continuing operations decreased in 2007 compared to prior year due to the decrease in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and a lower income tax benefit compared to 2006. The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended 2007 related primarily to a $56.0 million foreign currency impact on deferred taxes as a result of increases in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rates and $33.2 million lower tax reserves than in 2006. This decrease was partially offset by lower pre tax income, a $10.3 million increase in released valuation allowances and $24.3 million of additional tax credits. Minority interests increased primarily from the absorption of losses in excess of the minority interest capital contribution at one of our mines, partially offset by lower earnings allocable to partners. Outlook Near Term Outlook The current global financial slowdown has reduced gross domestic product expectations for U.S., China and other major world economies, which is expected to temper the growth of coal demand in the near term. As a result, we expect our 2009 prices to be lower than 2008 levels for our unpriced 2009 Australian based metallurgical and thermal coal (see further discussion of unpriced coal below). Fourth quarter 2008 global steel production declined 19% compared to fourth quarter 2007 due to the softening worldwide economies. Steel production in 2009 is anticipated to be as much as 20% lower than 2008. We estimate lower steel production will reduce 2009 seaborne metallurgical coal demand up to 40 million metric tonnes. In response to expected declines in demand, met coal producers have been reducing planned production levels. As of January 2009, approximately 30 million metric tonnes of seaborne met coal production cuts have been announced. In January 2009, we announced planned production cuts of up to 2 million tons of Australian based metallurgical coal to match expected changes in demand due to the global recession. As of January 2009, we have 4 to 5 million tons of expected Australian based metallurgical coal production available to be priced for the last three quarters of 2009. By the end of 2008, published thermal coal prices in most major markets declined from their mid 2008 highs, largely reversing gains from the first half of 2008. The decline was initiated by the accelerated liquidation of positions by financial counterparties that was followed by mild weather across the northern hemisphere during the third quarter of 2008 and the onset of the global economic downturn over the second half of the year. As of January 2009, we have 5 to 6 million tons of Australian based thermal coal available to be priced for the last three quarters of 2009. In the U.S., declining gross domestic product is expected to lead to reduced electricity demand for 2009. In addition, higher than normal stockpiles, low natural gas prices and lower U.S. exports could dampen 2009 U.S. coal demand by up to 60 to 70 million tons. U.S. coal production is adjusting to anticipated changes in 57 Table of Contents demand, with approximately 40 million tons of announced production cuts from 50% of the U.S. production base as of January 2009. In January 2009, we announced planned reductions in 2009 Powder River Basin production of 10 million tons to better match production with expected demand. Our U.S. production is largely sold out for 2009. We are targeting full year 2009 production of 190 to 195 million tons in the U.S. and 22 to 24 million tons in Australia with total sales in the range of 230 to 250 million tons. We rely on ongoing access to the worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. We continue to manage costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We have experienced increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs, including a company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Long term Outlook Given the current global economic conditions, the near term is less certain. However, our long term outlook remains positive. Coal has been the fastest growing fuel for each of the past five years, with consumption growing nearly twice as fast as total energy use. The IEAs World Energy Outlook estimates world primary energy demand will grow 45% between 2006 and 2030, with demand for coal rising more than any other fuel and comprising more than a third of the expected increase in energy use. China and India alone account for more than half of the expected incremental energy demand. Currently, 200 gigawatts of coal fired electricity generating plants are under construction around the world, representing nearly 700 million tons of annual coal demand expected to come online in the next several years. In the U.S., 30 units are currently under construction in 19 states, representing more than 16 gigawatts of capacity and approximately 70 million tons of annual coal demand. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as coal to gas (CTG) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants represent a significant avenue for potential long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including CTL, which is estimated to add 70 million tons of annual U.S. coal demand by 2030. In addition, China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. We continue to support clean coal technology development and voluntary initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation as a founding member of the FutureGen Alliance and the Australian COAL21 Fund, and through our participation in the Power Systems Development Facility, the PowerTree Carbon Company LLC, the Midwest Geopolitical Sequestration Consortium and the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate. In addition, we are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, a planned near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage which is under development in China. 58 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $74.4 million, while funding payments were $89.5 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 6.6 $ (5.7 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 79.7 $ (68.5 ) Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.8 $ (0.8 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (39.1 ) $ 41.1 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 10.68 years at December 31, 2008. 59 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $48.2 million, and payments totaled $11.4 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Interpretation No. 48 (FIN No. 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the effect of income taxes. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 92% of our revenue in 2008 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Under the typical terms of our coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal, freight and emissions allowances, both in over the counter markets and on exchanges. Under the provision of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, all derivative coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value (as defined by SFAS No. 157) basis, except those that qualify for and the Company has elected to apply a normal purchases and normal sales exception. For certain of our derivative coal trading contracts, we establish fair values using bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal, freight and 60 Table of Contents emission allowance positions from the over the counter market. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. For our exchange based positions, we utilize published settlement prices. Non derivative coal contracts, including those that qualify for and the Company has elected to apply a normal purchases and normal sales exception, are accounted for on an accrual basis. As of December 31, 2008, 94% of the contracts in our trading portfolio were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials. As of December 31, 2008, 75% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2009 and 88% within 24 months. See Note 3 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Fair Value Measurements We use various methods to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using market quoted inputs for valuation or corroboration as available. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the particular asset or liability, including assumptions about inherent risk. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements utilizing the best available information. We consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three hierarchy levels, Level 1, 2 and 3, as prescribed by SFAS No. 157 (see Note 3 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those which our positions extend out to periods where there is low trade activity or where broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include quotes from one to three reputable brokers where forward pricing curves are projected. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts, which are categorized by level in the table below. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. Net assets (liabilities) related to coal trading activities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: December 31, Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Level 1 $ (17.0 ) $ 5.9 $ (22.9 ) Level 2 337.8 (86.6 ) 424.4 Level 3 37.8 128.7 (90.9 ) Total $ 358.6 $ 48.0 $ 310.6 61 Table of Contents Our coal trading platform includes positions designed to secure forward pricing for some of our production (i.e. cash flow hedges wherein the effective portion of the change in the fair value is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until the hedged transaction occurs) as well as positions designed to generate current period trading results. Overall pricing increases since December 31, 2007 and higher trading volumes, particularly from our international trading activities, have increased the value of our coal trading portfolio during 2008. As a result, segment Adjusted EBITDA from our Trading and Brokerage segment totaled $218.9 million compared to $116.6 million in 2007. The fair value of coal trading positions designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated future sales was an asset of $220.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and a liability of $44.1 million as of December 31, 2007 (primarily classified as Level 2). The estimated realization of our aggregate coal trading portfolio of $358.6 million is 75% in 2009 and 88% within two years. Level 3 Net Financial Asset (Liability) Detail The Level 3 net financial assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2008 are as follows: Net financial assets (liabilities) (Dollars in millions) Physical commodity purchase/sale contracts coal trading activities $ 38.9 Commodity swaps and options coal trading activities (1.1 ) Total net Level 3 financial assets $ 37.8 Total net financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value $ (129.2 ) Percent of Level 3 net financial assets to total net financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value Not meaningful(1 ) (1) Percentage of Level 3 net financial assets compared to total net financial assets (liabilities) is not meaningful due to overall liability position as of December 31, 2008. The following table summarizes the changes in our recurring Level 3 net financial assets: Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Beginning of period $ 128.7 Total gains or losses (realized/unrealized): Included in earnings (9.8 ) Included in other comprehensive income 3.4 Purchases, issuances and settlements (58.8 ) Net transfers out (25.7 ) December 31, 2008 $ 37.8 The following table summarizes the changes in unrealized gains (losses) relating to Level 3 net financial assets still held as January 1 and December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Changes in unrealized losses(1) $ (34.8 ) (1) For the periods presented, unrealized gains and losses from Level 3 items are offset by unrealized gains and losses on positions classified in Level 1 or 2, as well as other positions that have been realized during the applicable periods. 62 Table of Contents Exploration and Drilling Costs Exploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Advance Stripping Costs Pre production: At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre production box cut to remove overburden (i.e., advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (i.e., advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices. Post production: Advance stripping costs related to post production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, we expense such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which we adopted using the modified prospective option on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123(R), share based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award. We utilize restricted stock, nonqualified stock options, performance units, deferred stock units and an employee stock purchase plan as part of our share based compensation program. Determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions, including items such as expected term, risk free rate, forfeiture rate and expected volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable (through our securitization program). Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, federal coal lease payments, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of our 5.875% and 6.875% Senior Notes and Debentures. We generally fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. We believe our available borrowing capicity and operating cash flows will be sufficient in the near term. As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. Our two defined benefit pension plans, which have approximately 45% of their assets invested in equity securities, experienced negative returns in 2008 due to recent equity market performance. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Protection Act), which was effective January 1, 2008, increased the long term funding targets for single employer pension plans from 90% to 100%. In addition, the Pension Protection 63 Table of Contents Act restricts at risk (generally defined as under 80% funded) plans from making lump sum payments and increasing benefits unless they are funded immediately, and also requires that the plan give participants notice regarding the at risk status of the plan. If a plan falls below 60%, lump sum payments are prohibited and participant benefit accruals cease. As of December 31, 2008, our pension plans were approximately 68% funded, before considering planned 2009 contributions. Our minimum funding requirement for 2009 is approximately $25 million, and would result in a funded status above 70%. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2008 increased $956.1 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily related to a current year increase in operating cash flows generated from our Australian mining operations and the timing of cash flows for working capital driven by an increase in income tax amounts that will be payable in future periods. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased $7.4 million in 2008 compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower capital spending of $160.5 million in 2008, mostly offset by the acquisition of minority interests of $110.1 million relating to our Millennium Mine, and a decrease in cash proceeds of $46.8 million, net of notes receivable, related to asset disposals. Net cash used in financing activities reflects a use of $375.8 million in 2008 compared to $44.7 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2007. The increase in the use of cash in 2008 is primarily due to the repurchase of $199.8 million of our outstanding common stock, $97.7 million to repay the borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility, and debt repayments of $32.7 million, including payments of $18.8 million on our Term Loan under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. During 2007, we repaid $37.9 million of our Term Loan and purchased in the open market $13.8 million face value of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. We also made the final principal payment of $59.5 million on our 5% Subordinated Note. Our Revolving Credit Facility balance increased $97.7 million in 2007 as it was utilized to fund cash contributions to Patriot at the spin off date. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 consisted of the following: December 31, 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 490.3 $ 509.1 Revolving Credit Facility 97.7 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 732.5 732.5 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 650.0 650.0 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650.0 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 247.0 247.0 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 218.1 218.1 6.84% Series C Bonds due 2016 43.0 43.0 6.34% Series B Bonds due 2014 18.0 21.0 6.84% Series A Bonds due 2014 10.0 10.0 Capital lease obligations 81.2 92.2 Fair value hedge adjustment 15.1 1.6 Other 1.0 0.9 Total $ 3,156.2 $ 3,273.1 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2008. 64 Table of Contents Senior Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2006, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a $2.75 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and which amended and restated in full our then existing $1.35 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Currently, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus 0.75%, which at December 31, 2008 was 2.2%. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The new facility is less restrictive with respect to limitations on our dividend payments, capital expenditures, asset sales or stock repurchases. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2008, we had no borrowings and $245.1 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility is primarily used for standby letters of credit and short term working capital needs. The remaining available borrowing capacity ($1.5 billion as of December 31, 2008) can be used to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs, including additional standby letters of credit. Other Long Term Debt A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Third party Security Ratings The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on our Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement On July 28, 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, 65 Table of Contents debt securities, warrants and units. The Debentures, 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Share Repurchase Program In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, approximately 13 million shares. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In addition, our Board of Directors had previously authorized our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside the repurchase program. In October 2008, our Board of Directors amended the share repurchase program to increase the total authorized amount to $1 billion. The amended repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. In 2008, we repurchased 5.5 million of our common shares for $199.8 million under this repurchase program and in 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares for $99.8 million under this repurchase program. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,356.1 $ 198.5 $ 861.8 $ 1,004.1 $ 3,291.8 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 99.4 19.1 30.2 38.1 12.0 Operating lease obligations 409.2 76.3 132.5 73.6 126.8 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 38.5 38.5 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 193.9 134.1 15.1 11.5 33.2 Other long term liabilities(2) 1,513.1 192.7 216.5 178.2 925.7 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,610.2 $ 659.2 $ 1,256.1 $ 1,305.5 $ 4,389.5 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2008, we had $38.5 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $124.6 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next five years. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures primarily relate to the replacement and improvement of equipment and facilities at existing mines. We expect to fund capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. We do not expect any of the $186.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as 66 Table of Contents bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (such as self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2008: Workers Reclamation Lease Compensation Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self Bonding $ 773.4 $ $ $ $ 773.4 Surety Bonds 740.6 99.2 19.3 15.2 874.3 Letters of Credit 0.1 54.9 199.3 254.3 $ 1,514.1 $ 99.2 $ 74.2 $ 214.5 $ 1,902.0 (1) Other includes the four letter of credit obligations described below and an additional $24.3 million in self bonding, letters of credit and surety bonds related to collateral for surety companies, road maintenance, performance guarantees and other operations. We own a 37.5% interest in a partnership that leases a coal export terminal from the Peninsula Ports Authority of Virginia under a 30 year lease that permits the partnership to purchase the terminal at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount. The partners have severally (but not jointly) agreed to make payments under various agreements which in the aggregate provide the partnership with sufficient funds to pay rents and to cover the principal and interest payments on the floating rate industrial revenue bonds issued by the Peninsula Ports Authority, and which are supported by letters of credit from a commercial bank. As of December 31, 2008, our maximum reimbursement obligation to the commercial bank was in turn supported by two letters of credit totaling $42.8 million. We are party to an agreement with the PBGC and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make special contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.) and continues under this process as of December 31, 2008. As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. At December 31, 2008, we have a $110.4 million letter of credit for collateral for bank guarantees issued with respect to certain reclamation and performance obligations related to the mines acquired in the Excel acquisition. Other Guarantees As part of arrangements through which we obtain exclusive sales representation agreements with small coal mining companies (the Counterparties), we issued financial guarantees on behalf of the Counterparties. These guarantees facilitate the Counterparties efforts to obtain bonding or financing. In the event of default, we have multiple recourse options, including the ability to assume the loans and procure title and use of the equipment purchased through the loans. If default occurs, we have the ability and intent to exercise our recourse options, so the liability associated with the guarantee has been valued at zero. The aggregate amount 67 Table of Contents guaranteed by us for all such Counterparties was $10.0 million at December 31, 2008. Our obligations under the guarantees extend to September 2013. As part of the Patriot spin off, we agreed to maintain several letters of credit that secured Patriot obligations for certain employee benefits and workers compensation obligations. These letters of credit are to be released upon Patriot satisfying the beneficiaries with alternate letters of credit or insurance. If Patriot is unable to satisfy the primary beneficiaries by June 30, 2011, they are then required to provide directly to us a letter of credit in the amount of the remaining obligation. The amount of letters of credit maintained by us securing Patriot obligations was $7.0 million at December 31, 2008 and $136.8 million at December 31, 2007. Under our accounts receivable securitization program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The securitization program and the underlying facilities will effectively expire in May 2009. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $275.0 million as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounts receivable securitization). Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, emission allowances, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal and ocean freight. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified 68 Table of Contents confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to option, swap and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. During 2008, we implemented a change to our volatility calculation by incorporating an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days. This algorithm makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our value at risk measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the combined actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $8.5 million, $27.2 million, and $19.1 million, respectively. Our value at risk increased over the prior year due to greater price volatility in the eastern U.S. and international coal markets. As of December 31, 2008, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage Expiration of Portfolio 2009 75 % 2010 13 % 2011 11 % 2012 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Performance and Credit Risk Our concentration of performance and credit risk is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. In general, increases in coal price volatility and our own trading activity resulted in greater exposure to our coal trading counterparties during 2008. In addition to credit risk, performance risk includes the possibility that a counterparty fails to deliver agreed production or trading volumes. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include 69 Table of Contents obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into agreements that include netting language with counterparties that permit us to offset trading positions, receivables, and payables with such counterparties. We conduct our various hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate management, and fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks. In light of the recent turmoil in the financial markets we continue to closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2009 targets hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a five cent change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $84.0 million for 2009. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $25.9 million for 2009. The chart at the end of Item 7A. shows the notional amount of our forward contracts as of December 31, 2008. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.5 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $691.2 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $6.9 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $145.2 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% and 87% of our worldwide sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of January 27, 2009, we have largely sold out expected 2009 U.S. production. We had 9 to 11 million tons remaining to be priced for 2009 in Australia at January 27, 2009. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, which are primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. As of December 31, 2008, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel and explosives. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 125 to 130 million gallons of fuel next year. A $10 dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $31 million. 70 Table of Contents Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the chart below. We expect to consume 335,000 to 345,000 tons of explosives per year in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included with the fees paid to our contract miners. Based on our expected usage, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $7 million.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 30 coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions, except Appalachia, and international interests in Australia and Venezuela. In 2008, we produced 223.7 million tons of coal and sold 255.5 million tons of coal. Our U.S. sales represented 18% of U.S. coal consumption and were approximately 30% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. U.S. coal consumption was approximately 1.1 billion tons in 2008, based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Coal is primarily used for baseload electricity requirements. In 2008, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 50%. Between 2007 and 2030, the EIA projects coal based electricity generation to grow 19%, outpacing all other primary fuel sources, representing 164 million tons of additional coal demand. During that same time frame, new coal to liquids facilities for both heat and power and liquids production is projected by the EIA to add another 70 million tons of coal demand. Coal production is expected to shift to western and interior U.S. locations to offset Appalachian declines. Specifically, production from facilities located west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth, comprising a 61% share of total production in 2030 versus 58% in 2007. Global coal consumption has grown faster than any other fuel, averaging nearly 5% per year between 2000 and 2007. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects demand for coal will rise more than any other fuel in absolute terms, accounting for over a third of the increase in energy use between 2006 and 2030. China and India combined represent 85% of the projected increase in world coal demand. Most of the increase in demand for coal comes from the power generation sector. Global electricity generation is projected by the IEA to rise 76% from 18,921 terawatt hours in 2006 to 33,265 terawatt hours in 2030. The IEA estimates 613 gigawatts of new power generating capacity is under construction around the world, approximately one third of which is coal based. The IEA expects coal to remain the main fuel for power generation worldwide, comprising 44% of the generation mix in 2030 versus 41% in 2006. In total, the IEA projects global primary coal demand will increase 61%, or approximately 2.6 billion tonnes by 2030. For the year ended December 31, 2008, 82% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 16% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2008, approximately 90% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by the recent economic downturn, poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at 47 Table of Contents mining locations and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations and are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Geologically, the Western U.S. Mining operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations and are characterized by a mix of surface and underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Geologically, the Midwestern U.S. Mining operations mine bituminous coal deposits. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as steam coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a small portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produced approximately 4.8 million tons of steam coal in 2008 for export to the U.S. and Europe. During 2008, the Paso Diablo Mine contributed $5.7 million to segment Adjusted EBITDA in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and paid a dividend of $19.9 million. At December 31, 2008, our investment in Paso Diablo was $54.2 million. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 3% of our total sales volume, but represents a larger share of our revenue, approximately 23% in 2008. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 90% of revenues in 2008, we generate revenues and additional cash flows from our Trading and Brokerage segment (9% of revenues) and other activities, including transactions utilizing our vast natural resource position (selling non core land holdings and mineral interests). We also continue to pursue development of coal fueled generating and Btu Conversion projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. Coal fueled generating projects may involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. Currently, we own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. The long term demand for oil and natural gas around the world is expected to lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel. We are exploring Btu Conversion projects designed to expand the uses of coal through coal to liquids and coal gasification technologies. Currently, we are pursuing development of a coal to gas facility in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The facility, known as Kentucky NewGas, is a planned mine mouth gasification project using ConocoPhillips proprietary E Gas(tm) technology to produce clean synthesis gas with carbon storage potential. The plant, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of 48 Table of Contents each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. We also own a minority interest in GreatPoint Energy, Inc., which is commercializing its coal to pipeline quality natural gas technology. We are participating in the advancement of clean coal technologies, including carbon capture and storage, in the U.S., China and Australia. We are a founding member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non profit company working in partnership with the U.S. DOE, which under its new configuration, would develop multiple carbon capture and storage sites. We are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, a near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage. And in Australia, we made a 10 year commitment to fund the Australian COAL21 Fund designed to support clean coal technology demonstration projects and research in Australia. Results of Operations The results of operations for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets and operations recently divested. Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Summary Higher average sales prices and volumes across all operating regions, particularly in Australia, contributed to a 45.1% increase in revenues to $6.59 billion. Segment Adjusted EBITDA rose 94.3% to $2.09 billion primarily on the higher pricing mentioned above and favorable results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales prices and volumes were partially offset by higher commodity, material, supply, sales related and labor costs in all operating regions. Income from continuing operations was $984.8 million in 2008, or $3.63 per diluted share, 123.8% above 2007 income from continuing operations of $440.0 million, or $1.63 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 169.7 161.4 8.3 5.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 30.7 29.6 1.1 3.7 % Australian Mining 23.9 21.0 2.9 13.8 % Trading and Brokerage 31.2 24.1 7.1 29.5 % Total tons sold 255.5 236.1 19.4 8.2 % 49 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,533.1 $ 2,063.2 $ 469.9 22.8 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,154.6 987.1 167.5 17.0 % Australian Mining 2,275.2 1,138.9 1,136.3 99.8 % Trading and Brokerage 601.8 320.7 281.1 87.7 % Other 28.7 35.2 (6.5 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,593.4 $ 4,545.1 $ 2,048.3 45.1 % Total revenues increased in 2008 compared to the prior year across all operating segments. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: An increase in average sales price at our Australian Mining operations (75.6%), primarily driven by the strength of metallurgical coal prices on our Australia contracts that reprice annually in the second quarter of each year. U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (15.2%) driven by the benefit of higher priced coal supply agreements signed in recent years. Australias volumes increased over the prior year (13.8%) from strong demand during the first three quarters of 2008 and additional production from recently completed mines. Year over year increases were partially offset by heavy rainfall and flooding in Queensland during the first quarter of 2008 and customer shipment deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic slowdown. Increased demand also led to higher volumes across our U.S. operating segments, which overcame slightly lower volumes at some of our Midwestern U.S. Mining surface operations due to poor weather in that operating region that impacted production during the first and second quarters. The volume increase of 5.1% at our Western U.S. Mining operations resulted from greater throughput from capital improvements and contributions from our new El Segundo Mine, partially offset by the flooding in the midwestern U.S. that impacted railroad shipping performance related to western U.S. production during the second quarter of 2008. Trading and Brokerage operations revenues increased over the prior year due to increased trading positions allowing us to capture market movements derived from the volatility of both domestic and international coal markets. Also impacting year over year revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations was an agreement to recover previously recognized postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs of $56.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. The agreement is discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 681.3 $ 595.4 $ 85.9 14.4 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 177.3 200.0 (22.7 ) (11.4 )% Australian Mining 1,017.0 166.1 850.9 512.3 % Trading and Brokerage 218.9 116.6 102.3 87.7 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.5 $ 1,078.1 $ 1,016.4 94.3 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2008 over the prior year primarily driven by an overall increase in average sales prices per ton across the region ($2.10) and higher volumes in the region due to increased demand and greater throughput as a result of capital improvements. Also contributing to the increase was the recovery of postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs discussed above. Partially offsetting the pricing and volume contributions were higher per ton costs ($1.78). The cost increases were primarily due to higher sales related costs, higher material, supply and labor costs, higher repair and maintenance costs in the Powder River Basin and increased commodity costs, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives pricing. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2008 as increases in average sales price per ton ($4.22) were offset by cost increases resulting from higher costs for commodities, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives prices, as well as higher material, supply and labor costs. Heavy rains and flooding in the midwestern U.S. affected sales volume at some of our mines, particularly in the first half of the year. Also affecting the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment was the decrease in revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants in the prior year ($28.9 million) due to the producers exiting the synthetic fuel market after expiration of federal tax credits at the end of 2007. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 primarily due to higher pricing negotiated in the second quarter of 2008 ($40.86 per ton), higher overall volumes as a result of strong export demand and contributions from our recently completed mines, and lower demurrage costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher fuel costs, an increase in labor and overburden removal expenses and higher contractor costs (five of ten Australian mines are managed utilizing contract miners). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 over the prior year due to increased trading volumes and higher coal price volatility. 51 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.5 $ 1,078.1 $ 1,016.4 94.3 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (247.2 ) (109.5 ) (137.7 ) (125.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (406.2 ) (352.2 ) (54.0 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.2 ) (23.7 ) (24.5 ) (103.4 )% Interest expense (226.2 ) (235.0 ) 8.8 3.7 % Interest income 10.1 7.1 3.0 42.3 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,176.8 $ 364.8 $ 812.0 222.6 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests increased over the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, and higher asset retirement obligation expense. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. The decrease in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the following: Higher selling and administrative expenses ($54.7 million) primarily driven by an increase in performance based incentive costs and legal expenses; Cost reimbursement and partner fees received in the prior year for the Prairie State project, primarily related to the entrance of new project partners ($29.5 million); Lower net gains on disposals or exchanges of assets ($15.7 million). 2008 activity included a gain of $54.0 million on the sale of approximately 58 million tons of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. 2007 activity included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of oil and gas rights and assets in more than 860,000 acres in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for coal reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. The prior year also included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands to the Prairie State equity partners; and Lower equity income ($15.5 million) from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela) and higher costs associated with Btu Conversion activities of $14.3 million in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was higher in 2008 compared to the prior year because of increased depletion across our operating platform resulting from the volume increases and the impact of mining higher value coal reserves. In addition, depreciation and depletion increases resulted from our recently completed Australian mines and depletion at our El Segundo Mine. Asset retirement obligation expense increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to an increase in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates that reflect higher fuel, labor and re vegetation costs, as well as an overall increase in the number of acres disturbed. The addition of the El Segundo Mine, which was completed in June 2008, also contributed to higher asset retirement obligation expense. 52 Table of Contents Net Income The following table presents net income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,176.8 $ 364.8 $ 812.0 222.6 % Income tax (provision) benefit (185.8 ) 72.9 (258.7 ) (354.9 )% Minority interests (6.2 ) 2.3 (8.5 ) (369.6 )% Income from continuing operations 984.8 440.0 544.8 123.8 % Loss from discontinued operations (31.3 ) (175.7 ) 144.4 82.2 % Net income $ 953.5 $ 264.3 $ 689.2 260.8 % Net income increased in 2008 compared to the prior year due to the increase in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes and minority interests discussed above. The tax provision increase over the prior year is the result of the current year increased pre tax earnings ($292.6 million) combined with the valuation allowance release against federal net operating loss credits recognized into income in the prior year ($197.8 million). These increases were partially offset by the non cash tax benefit from the remeasurement of non U.S. dollar denominated income tax accounts as a result of the strengthening of the Australian dollar in 2007 as compared to weakening of the Australian dollar in 2008 ($121.3 million), the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income ($110.8 million) and the release of a valuation allowance against a portion of our Australia net operating loss carryforwards in the current year ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a lower loss from discontinued operations as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred for Patriot operations in 2007. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 related to operating losses, net of a gain on sale of assets previously held for sale ($19.6 million) and an $11.7 million write off of an excise tax refund receivable (net of tax) as a result of an April 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Summary Higher average sales prices across all U.S. regions and increased volumes, primarily from Australian Mining operations, contributed to a 12.2% increase in revenues to $4.55 billion compared to 2006. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.8% to $1.08 billion primarily on higher prices in the Western U.S. Mining operations and increased results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues, higher commodity costs, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar. Also, negatively impacting Australian Mining results was lower metallurgical coal prices associated with annual contracts that began in April 2007. Income from continuing operations was $440.0 million in 2007, or $1.63 per diluted share, a decrease of 22.8% from 2006 income from continuing operations of $569.9 million, or $2.12 per diluted share. 53 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2007 2006 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 161.4 160.5 0.9 0.6 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 29.6 28.7 0.9 3.1 % Australian Mining 21.0 10.8 10.2 94.4 % Trading and Brokerage 24.1 21.4 2.7 12.6 % Total tons sold 236.1 221.4 14.7 6.6 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,063.2 $ 1,703.4 $ 359.8 21.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 987.1 858.5 128.6 15.0 % Australian Mining 1,138.9 833.0 305.9 36.7 % Trading and Brokerage 320.7 652.0 (331.3 ) (50.8 )% Other 35.2 4.0 31.2 780.0 % Total revenues $ 4,545.1 $ 4,050.9 $ 494.2 12.2 % Total revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 across all mining operations. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: Prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased due to a sales realization increase of approximately 29% for our premium Powder River Basin product and an average increase across all U.S. regions of 16%. Midwestern U.S. Mining revenues increased due to higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants as those plants were idled for part of 2006. Increased volumes from our Australian Mining operations. Volumes related to operations acquired in the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 10.9 million tons of the increase to tons sold. Offsetting this increase was lower average sales prices in our Australian Mining operations related to lower metallurgical contract pricing and a significant change in sales mix resulting in higher thermal export and domestic product sales. Volumes were unfavorably impacted at some of our Australian Mining operations as a result of damaged rails and further amplified port and rail congestion throughout the year, in addition to adverse weather events that affected production. Partially offsetting sales price and volume increases was the continued shift towards trading contracts versus brokerage contracts in our Trading and Brokerage operations. Trading and Brokerage operations sales decreased during 2007 as the amount of brokerage business was reduced and replacement business was in the form of traded contracts. Contracts for trading activity are recorded at net margin in other revenues, whereas contracts for brokerage activity are recorded at gross sales price to revenues and operating costs. 54 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 595.4 $ 473.1 $ 122.3 25.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 200.0 186.2 13.8 7.4 % Australian Mining 166.1 286.8 (120.7 ) (42.1 )% Trading and Brokerage 116.6 92.6 24.0 25.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,078.1 $ 1,038.7 $ 39.4 3.8 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2007 over 2006 primarily related to the overall increase in average sales prices from our Powder River Basin operations. Partially offsetting higher average sales prices were higher costs associated with equipment repairs and maintenance and higher add on taxes and royalties driven by higher sales prices compared to the prior year, mine shutdown for maintenance in our Colorado mine, higher fuel costs and adverse weather conditions in the Powder River Basin and capital project delays. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2007 over 2006 as both volumes and prices per ton saw moderate increases. Results improved compared to 2006 as benefits of higher volumes and sales prices were offset by higher costs for commodities, including fuel. The 2007 results were also positively impacted by higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel facilities of $12.5 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants for a portion of 2006. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to approximately $31 million of higher costs resulting from the weakening U.S. dollar (higher costs of approximately $112 million were offset by hedging gains of $81 million); higher congestion related demurrage costs (approximately $50 million); lower pricing on annually repriced metallurgical coal contracts; and, rail and port congestion at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and the Port of Newcastle. Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal had been experiencing queues of over 41 vessels (approximately a 24 day load time) down from 50 vessels in the second quarter (approximately a 34 day delay). Partially offsetting these decreases were the full year contributions from our mines acquired in the Excel acquisition and a $6.3 million insurance recovery on a business interruption claim in the first half of 2007. Our Australian mines acquired in 2006 experienced shipping difficulties and damaged rail lines resulting from a storm late in 2007. The Port of Newcastle was closed for several days in 2007 due to a storm, with up to 79 vessels in the queue (a 35 40 day wait). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2007 over 2006 as the results reflected higher international trading gains, resulting from higher volumes and pricing due to expanded global trading activities, strong supply/demand fundamentals and tightened seaborne market conditions. 55 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,078.1 $ 1,038.7 $ 39.4 3.8 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (109.5 ) (127.7 ) 18.2 14.3 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (352.2 ) (284.2 ) (68.0 ) (23.9 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (23.7 ) (14.2 ) (9.5 ) (66.9 )% Interest expense (235.0 ) (139.1 ) (95.9 ) (68.9 )% Interest income 7.1 11.3 (4.2 ) (37.2 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 364.8 $ 484.8 $ (120.0 ) (24.8 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests in 2007 was lower than 2006 primarily due to higher interest expense and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the acquisition of Excel in late 2006. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development, Btu Conversion development and resource management. The improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA in 2007 compared to 2006 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $35.1 million. The 2007 activity included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves to the Prairie State equity partners. Our 2007 activity also included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of our coalbed methane and oil and gas rights in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for high Btu coal reserves located in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. In comparison, the 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million; Higher past mining obligation expenses of $15.5 million resulting from increased retiree healthcare costs due to higher than anticipated healthcare utilization by retirees, particularly related to prescription drugs; Higher selling and administrative expenses of $19.1 million primarily resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and other corporate development initiatives; and Lower equity income of $6.8 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela), which primarily resulted from trucking issues experienced earlier in the year, a temporary shortage of explosives and delays in receiving equipment, which impacted operations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $68.0 million primarily related to the addition of the Australian operations acquired in late 2006. Interest expense increased $95.9 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion in new debt issued or assumed as part of the Excel acquisition in the second half of 2006. 56 Table of Contents Net Income The following table presents net income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 364.8 $ 484.8 $ (120.0 ) (24.8 )% Income tax benefit 72.9 85.7 (12.8 ) (14.9 )% Minority interests 2.3 (0.6 ) 2.9 483.3 % Income from continuing operations 440.0 569.9 (129.9 ) (22.8 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations (175.7 ) 30.8 (206.5 ) (670.5 )% Net income $ 264.3 $ 600.7 $ (336.4 ) (56.0 )% Income from continuing operations decreased in 2007 compared to prior year due to the decrease in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and a lower income tax benefit compared to 2006. The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended 2007 related primarily to a $56.0 million foreign currency impact on deferred taxes as a result of increases in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rates and $33.2 million lower tax reserves than in 2006. This decrease was partially offset by lower pre tax income, a $10.3 million increase in released valuation allowances and $24.3 million of additional tax credits. Minority interests increased primarily from the absorption of losses in excess of the minority interest capital contribution at one of our mines, partially offset by lower earnings allocable to partners. Outlook Near Term Outlook The current global financial slowdown has reduced gross domestic product expectations for U.S., China and other major world economies, which is expected to temper the growth of coal demand in the near term. As a result, we expect our 2009 prices to be lower than 2008 levels for our unpriced 2009 Australian based metallurgical and thermal coal (see further discussion of unpriced coal below). Fourth quarter 2008 global steel production declined 19% compared to fourth quarter 2007 due to the softening worldwide economies. Steel production in 2009 is anticipated to be as much as 20% lower than 2008. We estimate lower steel production will reduce 2009 seaborne metallurgical coal demand up to 40 million metric tonnes. In response to expected declines in demand, met coal producers have been reducing planned production levels. As of January 2009, approximately 30 million metric tonnes of seaborne met coal production cuts have been announced. In January 2009, we announced planned production cuts of up to 2 million tons of Australian based metallurgical coal to match expected changes in demand due to the global recession. As of January 2009, we have 4 to 5 million tons of expected Australian based metallurgical coal production available to be priced for the last three quarters of 2009. By the end of 2008, published thermal coal prices in most major markets declined from their mid 2008 highs, largely reversing gains from the first half of 2008. The decline was initiated by the accelerated liquidation of positions by financial counterparties that was followed by mild weather across the northern hemisphere during the third quarter of 2008 and the onset of the global economic downturn over the second half of the year. As of January 2009, we have 5 to 6 million tons of Australian based thermal coal available to be priced for the last three quarters of 2009. In the U.S., declining gross domestic product is expected to lead to reduced electricity demand for 2009. In addition, higher than normal stockpiles, low natural gas prices and lower U.S. exports could dampen 2009 U.S. coal demand by up to 60 to 70 million tons. U.S. coal production is adjusting to anticipated changes in 57 Table of Contents demand, with approximately 40 million tons of announced production cuts from 50% of the U.S. production base as of January 2009. In January 2009, we announced planned reductions in 2009 Powder River Basin production of 10 million tons to better match production with expected demand. Our U.S. production is largely sold out for 2009. We are targeting full year 2009 production of 190 to 195 million tons in the U.S. and 22 to 24 million tons in Australia with total sales in the range of 230 to 250 million tons. We rely on ongoing access to the worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. We continue to manage costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We have experienced increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs, including a company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Long term Outlook Given the current global economic conditions, the near term is less certain. However, our long term outlook remains positive. Coal has been the fastest growing fuel for each of the past five years, with consumption growing nearly twice as fast as total energy use. The IEAs World Energy Outlook estimates world primary energy demand will grow 45% between 2006 and 2030, with demand for coal rising more than any other fuel and comprising more than a third of the expected increase in energy use. China and India alone account for more than half of the expected incremental energy demand. Currently, 200 gigawatts of coal fired electricity generating plants are under construction around the world, representing nearly 700 million tons of annual coal demand expected to come online in the next several years. In the U.S., 30 units are currently under construction in 19 states, representing more than 16 gigawatts of capacity and approximately 70 million tons of annual coal demand. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as coal to gas (CTG) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants represent a significant avenue for potential long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including CTL, which is estimated to add 70 million tons of annual U.S. coal demand by 2030. In addition, China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. We continue to support clean coal technology development and voluntary initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation as a founding member of the FutureGen Alliance and the Australian COAL21 Fund, and through our participation in the Power Systems Development Facility, the PowerTree Carbon Company LLC, the Midwest Geopolitical Sequestration Consortium and the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate. In addition, we are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, a planned near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage which is under development in China. 58 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $74.4 million, while funding payments were $89.5 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 6.6 $ (5.7 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 79.7 $ (68.5 ) Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.8 $ (0.8 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (39.1 ) $ 41.1 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 10.68 years at December 31, 2008. 59 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $48.2 million, and payments totaled $11.4 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Interpretation No. 48 (FIN No. 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the effect of income taxes. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 92% of our revenue in 2008 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Under the typical terms of our coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal, freight and emissions allowances, both in over the counter markets and on exchanges. Under the provision of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, all derivative coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value (as defined by SFAS No. 157) basis, except those that qualify for and the Company has elected to apply a normal purchases and normal sales exception. For certain of our derivative coal trading contracts, we establish fair values using bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal, freight and 60 Table of Contents emission allowance positions from the over the counter market. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. For our exchange based positions, we utilize published settlement prices. Non derivative coal contracts, including those that qualify for and the Company has elected to apply a normal purchases and normal sales exception, are accounted for on an accrual basis. As of December 31, 2008, 94% of the contracts in our trading portfolio were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials. As of December 31, 2008, 75% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2009 and 88% within 24 months. See Note 3 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Fair Value Measurements We use various methods to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using market quoted inputs for valuation or corroboration as available. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the particular asset or liability, including assumptions about inherent risk. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements utilizing the best available information. We consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three hierarchy levels, Level 1, 2 and 3, as prescribed by SFAS No. 157 (see Note 3 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those which our positions extend out to periods where there is low trade activity or where broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include quotes from one to three reputable brokers where forward pricing curves are projected. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts, which are categorized by level in the table below. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. Net assets (liabilities) related to coal trading activities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: December 31, Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Level 1 $ (17.0 ) $ 5.9 $ (22.9 ) Level 2 337.8 (86.6 ) 424.4 Level 3 37.8 128.7 (90.9 ) Total $ 358.6 $ 48.0 $ 310.6 61 Table of Contents Our coal trading platform includes positions designed to secure forward pricing for some of our production (i.e. cash flow hedges wherein the effective portion of the change in the fair value is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until the hedged transaction occurs) as well as positions designed to generate current period trading results. Overall pricing increases since December 31, 2007 and higher trading volumes, particularly from our international trading activities, have increased the value of our coal trading portfolio during 2008. As a result, segment Adjusted EBITDA from our Trading and Brokerage segment totaled $218.9 million compared to $116.6 million in 2007. The fair value of coal trading positions designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated future sales was an asset of $220.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and a liability of $44.1 million as of December 31, 2007 (primarily classified as Level 2). The estimated realization of our aggregate coal trading portfolio of $358.6 million is 75% in 2009 and 88% within two years. Level 3 Net Financial Asset (Liability) Detail The Level 3 net financial assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2008 are as follows: Net financial assets (liabilities) (Dollars in millions) Physical commodity purchase/sale contracts coal trading activities $ 38.9 Commodity swaps and options coal trading activities (1.1 ) Total net Level 3 financial assets $ 37.8 Total net financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value $ (129.2 ) Percent of Level 3 net financial assets to total net financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value Not meaningful(1 ) (1) Percentage of Level 3 net financial assets compared to total net financial assets (liabilities) is not meaningful due to overall liability position as of December 31, 2008. The following table summarizes the changes in our recurring Level 3 net financial assets: Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Beginning of period $ 128.7 Total gains or losses (realized/unrealized): Included in earnings (9.8 ) Included in other comprehensive income 3.4 Purchases, issuances and settlements (58.8 ) Net transfers out (25.7 ) December 31, 2008 $ 37.8 The following table summarizes the changes in unrealized gains (losses) relating to Level 3 net financial assets still held as January 1 and December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Changes in unrealized losses(1) $ (34.8 ) (1) For the periods presented, unrealized gains and losses from Level 3 items are offset by unrealized gains and losses on positions classified in Level 1 or 2, as well as other positions that have been realized during the applicable periods. 62 Table of Contents Exploration and Drilling Costs Exploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Advance Stripping Costs Pre production: At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre production box cut to remove overburden (i.e., advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (i.e., advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices. Post production: Advance stripping costs related to post production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, we expense such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which we adopted using the modified prospective option on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123(R), share based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award. We utilize restricted stock, nonqualified stock options, performance units, deferred stock units and an employee stock purchase plan as part of our share based compensation program. Determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions, including items such as expected term, risk free rate, forfeiture rate and expected volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable (through our securitization program). Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, federal coal lease payments, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of our 5.875% and 6.875% Senior Notes and Debentures. We generally fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. We believe our available borrowing capicity and operating cash flows will be sufficient in the near term. As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. Our two defined benefit pension plans, which have approximately 45% of their assets invested in equity securities, experienced negative returns in 2008 due to recent equity market performance. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Protection Act), which was effective January 1, 2008, increased the long term funding targets for single employer pension plans from 90% to 100%. In addition, the Pension Protection 63 Table of Contents Act restricts at risk (generally defined as under 80% funded) plans from making lump sum payments and increasing benefits unless they are funded immediately, and also requires that the plan give participants notice regarding the at risk status of the plan. If a plan falls below 60%, lump sum payments are prohibited and participant benefit accruals cease. As of December 31, 2008, our pension plans were approximately 68% funded, before considering planned 2009 contributions. Our minimum funding requirement for 2009 is approximately $25 million, and would result in a funded status above 70%. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2008 increased $956.1 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily related to a current year increase in operating cash flows generated from our Australian mining operations and the timing of cash flows for working capital driven by an increase in income tax amounts that will be payable in future periods. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased $7.4 million in 2008 compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower capital spending of $160.5 million in 2008, mostly offset by the acquisition of minority interests of $110.1 million relating to our Millennium Mine, and a decrease in cash proceeds of $46.8 million, net of notes receivable, related to asset disposals. Net cash used in financing activities reflects a use of $375.8 million in 2008 compared to $44.7 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2007. The increase in the use of cash in 2008 is primarily due to the repurchase of $199.8 million of our outstanding common stock, $97.7 million to repay the borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility, and debt repayments of $32.7 million, including payments of $18.8 million on our Term Loan under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. During 2007, we repaid $37.9 million of our Term Loan and purchased in the open market $13.8 million face value of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. We also made the final principal payment of $59.5 million on our 5% Subordinated Note. Our Revolving Credit Facility balance increased $97.7 million in 2007 as it was utilized to fund cash contributions to Patriot at the spin off date. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 consisted of the following: December 31, 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 490.3 $ 509.1 Revolving Credit Facility 97.7 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 732.5 732.5 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 650.0 650.0 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650.0 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 247.0 247.0 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 218.1 218.1 6.84% Series C Bonds due 2016 43.0 43.0 6.34% Series B Bonds due 2014 18.0 21.0 6.84% Series A Bonds due 2014 10.0 10.0 Capital lease obligations 81.2 92.2 Fair value hedge adjustment 15.1 1.6 Other 1.0 0.9 Total $ 3,156.2 $ 3,273.1 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2008. 64 Table of Contents Senior Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2006, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a $2.75 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and which amended and restated in full our then existing $1.35 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Currently, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus 0.75%, which at December 31, 2008 was 2.2%. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The new facility is less restrictive with respect to limitations on our dividend payments, capital expenditures, asset sales or stock repurchases. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2008, we had no borrowings and $245.1 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility is primarily used for standby letters of credit and short term working capital needs. The remaining available borrowing capacity ($1.5 billion as of December 31, 2008) can be used to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs, including additional standby letters of credit. Other Long Term Debt A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Third party Security Ratings The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on our Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement On July 28, 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, 65 Table of Contents debt securities, warrants and units. The Debentures, 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Share Repurchase Program In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, approximately 13 million shares. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In addition, our Board of Directors had previously authorized our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside the repurchase program. In October 2008, our Board of Directors amended the share repurchase program to increase the total authorized amount to $1 billion. The amended repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. In 2008, we repurchased 5.5 million of our common shares for $199.8 million under this repurchase program and in 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares for $99.8 million under this repurchase program. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,356.1 $ 198.5 $ 861.8 $ 1,004.1 $ 3,291.8 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 99.4 19.1 30.2 38.1 12.0 Operating lease obligations 409.2 76.3 132.5 73.6 126.8 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 38.5 38.5 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 193.9 134.1 15.1 11.5 33.2 Other long term liabilities(2) 1,513.1 192.7 216.5 178.2 925.7 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,610.2 $ 659.2 $ 1,256.1 $ 1,305.5 $ 4,389.5 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2008, we had $38.5 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $124.6 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next five years. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures primarily relate to the replacement and improvement of equipment and facilities at existing mines. We expect to fund capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. We do not expect any of the $186.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as 66 Table of Contents bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (such as self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2008: Workers Reclamation Lease Compensation Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self Bonding $ 773.4 $ $ $ $ 773.4 Surety Bonds 740.6 99.2 19.3 15.2 874.3 Letters of Credit 0.1 54.9 199.3 254.3 $ 1,514.1 $ 99.2 $ 74.2 $ 214.5 $ 1,902.0 (1) Other includes the four letter of credit obligations described below and an additional $24.3 million in self bonding, letters of credit and surety bonds related to collateral for surety companies, road maintenance, performance guarantees and other operations. We own a 37.5% interest in a partnership that leases a coal export terminal from the Peninsula Ports Authority of Virginia under a 30 year lease that permits the partnership to purchase the terminal at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount. The partners have severally (but not jointly) agreed to make payments under various agreements which in the aggregate provide the partnership with sufficient funds to pay rents and to cover the principal and interest payments on the floating rate industrial revenue bonds issued by the Peninsula Ports Authority, and which are supported by letters of credit from a commercial bank. As of December 31, 2008, our maximum reimbursement obligation to the commercial bank was in turn supported by two letters of credit totaling $42.8 million. We are party to an agreement with the PBGC and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make special contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.) and continues under this process as of December 31, 2008. As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. At December 31, 2008, we have a $110.4 million letter of credit for collateral for bank guarantees issued with respect to certain reclamation and performance obligations related to the mines acquired in the Excel acquisition. Other Guarantees As part of arrangements through which we obtain exclusive sales representation agreements with small coal mining companies (the Counterparties), we issued financial guarantees on behalf of the Counterparties. These guarantees facilitate the Counterparties efforts to obtain bonding or financing. In the event of default, we have multiple recourse options, including the ability to assume the loans and procure title and use of the equipment purchased through the loans. If default occurs, we have the ability and intent to exercise our recourse options, so the liability associated with the guarantee has been valued at zero. The aggregate amount 67 Table of Contents guaranteed by us for all such Counterparties was $10.0 million at December 31, 2008. Our obligations under the guarantees extend to September 2013. As part of the Patriot spin off, we agreed to maintain several letters of credit that secured Patriot obligations for certain employee benefits and workers compensation obligations. These letters of credit are to be released upon Patriot satisfying the beneficiaries with alternate letters of credit or insurance. If Patriot is unable to satisfy the primary beneficiaries by June 30, 2011, they are then required to provide directly to us a letter of credit in the amount of the remaining obligation. The amount of letters of credit maintained by us securing Patriot obligations was $7.0 million at December 31, 2008 and $136.8 million at December 31, 2007. Under our accounts receivable securitization program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The securitization program and the underlying facilities will effectively expire in May 2009. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $275.0 million as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounts receivable securitization). Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, emission allowances, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal and ocean freight. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified 68 Table of Contents confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to option, swap and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. During 2008, we implemented a change to our volatility calculation by incorporating an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days. This algorithm makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our value at risk measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the combined actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $8.5 million, $27.2 million, and $19.1 million, respectively. Our value at risk increased over the prior year due to greater price volatility in the eastern U.S. and international coal markets. As of December 31, 2008, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage Expiration of Portfolio 2009 75 % 2010 13 % 2011 11 % 2012 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Performance and Credit Risk Our concentration of performance and credit risk is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. In general, increases in coal price volatility and our own trading activity resulted in greater exposure to our coal trading counterparties during 2008. In addition to credit risk, performance risk includes the possibility that a counterparty fails to deliver agreed production or trading volumes. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include 69 Table of Contents obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into agreements that include netting language with counterparties that permit us to offset trading positions, receivables, and payables with such counterparties. We conduct our various hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate management, and fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks. In light of the recent turmoil in the financial markets we continue to closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2009 targets hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a five cent change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $84.0 million for 2009. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $25.9 million for 2009. The chart at the end of Item 7A. shows the notional amount of our forward contracts as of December 31, 2008. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.5 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $691.2 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $6.9 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $145.2 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% and 87% of our worldwide sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of January 27, 2009, we have largely sold out expected 2009 U.S. production. We had 9 to 11 million tons remaining to be priced for 2009 in Australia at January 27, 2009. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, which are primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. As of December 31, 2008, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel and explosives. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 125 to 130 million gallons of fuel next year. A $10 dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $31 million. 70 Table of Contents Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the chart below. We expect to consume 335,000 to 345,000 tons of explosives per year in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included with the fees paid to our contract miners. Based on our expected usage, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $7 million.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the largest private sector coal company in the world, with majority interests in 30 coal operations located throughout all major U.S. coal producing regions, except Appalachia, and international interests in Australia and Venezuela. In 2008, we produced 223.7 million tons of coal and sold 255.5 million tons of coal. Our U.S. sales represented 18% of U.S. coal consumption and were approximately 30% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. U.S. coal consumption was approximately 1.1 billion tons in 2008, based on Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates. Coal is primarily used for baseload electricity requirements. In 2008, coals share of electricity generation was approximately 50%. Between 2007 and 2030, the EIA projects coal based electricity generation to grow 19%, outpacing all other primary fuel sources, representing 164 million tons of additional coal demand. During that same time frame, new coal to liquids facilities for both heat and power and liquids production is projected by the EIA to add another 70 million tons of coal demand. Coal production is expected to shift to western and interior U.S. locations to offset Appalachian declines. Specifically, production from facilities located west of the Mississippi River is projected to provide most of the incremental growth, comprising a 61% share of total production in 2030 versus 58% in 2007. Global coal consumption has grown faster than any other fuel, averaging nearly 5% per year between 2000 and 2007. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects demand for coal will rise more than any other fuel in absolute terms, accounting for over a third of the increase in energy use between 2006 and 2030. China and India combined represent 85% of the projected increase in world coal demand. Most of the increase in demand for coal comes from the power generation sector. Global electricity generation is projected by the IEA to rise 76% from 18,921 terawatt hours in 2006 to 33,265 terawatt hours in 2030. The IEA estimates 613 gigawatts of new power generating capacity is under construction around the world, approximately one third of which is coal based. The IEA expects coal to remain the main fuel for power generation worldwide, comprising 44% of the generation mix in 2030 versus 41% in 2006. In total, the IEA projects global primary coal demand will increase 61%, or approximately 2.6 billion tonnes by 2030. For the year ended December 31, 2008, 82% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 16% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2008, approximately 90% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by the recent economic downturn, poor weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at 47 Table of Contents mining locations and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. We conduct business through four principal operating segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of steam coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations and are characterized by predominantly surface extraction processes, lower sulfur content and Btu of coal, and higher customer transportation costs (due to longer shipping distances). Geologically, the Western U.S. Mining operations mine bituminous and subbituminous coal deposits. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations and are characterized by a mix of surface and underground extraction processes, higher sulfur content and Btu of coal and lower customer transportation costs (due to shorter shipping distances). Geologically, the Midwestern U.S. Mining operations mine bituminous coal deposits. Australian Mining operations are characterized by both surface and underground extraction processes, mining various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as steam coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a small portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. We own a 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare, which owns and operates the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela. The Paso Diablo Mine produced approximately 4.8 million tons of steam coal in 2008 for export to the U.S. and Europe. During 2008, the Paso Diablo Mine contributed $5.7 million to segment Adjusted EBITDA in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and paid a dividend of $19.9 million. At December 31, 2008, our investment in Paso Diablo was $54.2 million. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. Metallurgical coal is approximately 3% of our total sales volume, but represents a larger share of our revenue, approximately 23% in 2008. In addition to our mining operations, which comprised 90% of revenues in 2008, we generate revenues and additional cash flows from our Trading and Brokerage segment (9% of revenues) and other activities, including transactions utilizing our vast natural resource position (selling non core land holdings and mineral interests). We also continue to pursue development of coal fueled generating and Btu Conversion projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. Coal fueled generating projects may involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. Currently, we own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. The long term demand for oil and natural gas around the world is expected to lead to an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel. We are exploring Btu Conversion projects designed to expand the uses of coal through coal to liquids and coal gasification technologies. Currently, we are pursuing development of a coal to gas facility in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The facility, known as Kentucky NewGas, is a planned mine mouth gasification project using ConocoPhillips proprietary E Gas(tm) technology to produce clean synthesis gas with carbon storage potential. The plant, assuming all necessary permits and financing are obtained and following selection of partners and sale of a majority of the output of 48 Table of Contents each plant, could be operational following a four year construction phase. We also own a minority interest in GreatPoint Energy, Inc., which is commercializing its coal to pipeline quality natural gas technology. We are participating in the advancement of clean coal technologies, including carbon capture and storage, in the U.S., China and Australia. We are a founding member of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non profit company working in partnership with the U.S. DOE, which under its new configuration, would develop multiple carbon capture and storage sites. We are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, a near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage. And in Australia, we made a 10 year commitment to fund the Australian COAL21 Fund designed to support clean coal technology demonstration projects and research in Australia. Results of Operations The results of operations for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets and operations recently divested. Adjusted EBITDA The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to and analysis of our segments Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, minority interests, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under generally accepted accounting principles, in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Summary Higher average sales prices and volumes across all operating regions, particularly in Australia, contributed to a 45.1% increase in revenues to $6.59 billion. Segment Adjusted EBITDA rose 94.3% to $2.09 billion primarily on the higher pricing mentioned above and favorable results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales prices and volumes were partially offset by higher commodity, material, supply, sales related and labor costs in all operating regions. Income from continuing operations was $984.8 million in 2008, or $3.63 per diluted share, 123.8% above 2007 income from continuing operations of $440.0 million, or $1.63 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 169.7 161.4 8.3 5.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 30.7 29.6 1.1 3.7 % Australian Mining 23.9 21.0 2.9 13.8 % Trading and Brokerage 31.2 24.1 7.1 29.5 % Total tons sold 255.5 236.1 19.4 8.2 % 49 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,533.1 $ 2,063.2 $ 469.9 22.8 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,154.6 987.1 167.5 17.0 % Australian Mining 2,275.2 1,138.9 1,136.3 99.8 % Trading and Brokerage 601.8 320.7 281.1 87.7 % Other 28.7 35.2 (6.5 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,593.4 $ 4,545.1 $ 2,048.3 45.1 % Total revenues increased in 2008 compared to the prior year across all operating segments. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: An increase in average sales price at our Australian Mining operations (75.6%), primarily driven by the strength of metallurgical coal prices on our Australia contracts that reprice annually in the second quarter of each year. U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (15.2%) driven by the benefit of higher priced coal supply agreements signed in recent years. Australias volumes increased over the prior year (13.8%) from strong demand during the first three quarters of 2008 and additional production from recently completed mines. Year over year increases were partially offset by heavy rainfall and flooding in Queensland during the first quarter of 2008 and customer shipment deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic slowdown. Increased demand also led to higher volumes across our U.S. operating segments, which overcame slightly lower volumes at some of our Midwestern U.S. Mining surface operations due to poor weather in that operating region that impacted production during the first and second quarters. The volume increase of 5.1% at our Western U.S. Mining operations resulted from greater throughput from capital improvements and contributions from our new El Segundo Mine, partially offset by the flooding in the midwestern U.S. that impacted railroad shipping performance related to western U.S. production during the second quarter of 2008. Trading and Brokerage operations revenues increased over the prior year due to increased trading positions allowing us to capture market movements derived from the volatility of both domestic and international coal markets. Also impacting year over year revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations was an agreement to recover previously recognized postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs of $56.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. The agreement is discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 681.3 $ 595.4 $ 85.9 14.4 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 177.3 200.0 (22.7 ) (11.4 )% Australian Mining 1,017.0 166.1 850.9 512.3 % Trading and Brokerage 218.9 116.6 102.3 87.7 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.5 $ 1,078.1 $ 1,016.4 94.3 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2008 over the prior year primarily driven by an overall increase in average sales prices per ton across the region ($2.10) and higher volumes in the region due to increased demand and greater throughput as a result of capital improvements. Also contributing to the increase was the recovery of postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs discussed above. Partially offsetting the pricing and volume contributions were higher per ton costs ($1.78). The cost increases were primarily due to higher sales related costs, higher material, supply and labor costs, higher repair and maintenance costs in the Powder River Basin and increased commodity costs, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives pricing. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2008 as increases in average sales price per ton ($4.22) were offset by cost increases resulting from higher costs for commodities, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives prices, as well as higher material, supply and labor costs. Heavy rains and flooding in the midwestern U.S. affected sales volume at some of our mines, particularly in the first half of the year. Also affecting the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment was the decrease in revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants in the prior year ($28.9 million) due to the producers exiting the synthetic fuel market after expiration of federal tax credits at the end of 2007. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 primarily due to higher pricing negotiated in the second quarter of 2008 ($40.86 per ton), higher overall volumes as a result of strong export demand and contributions from our recently completed mines, and lower demurrage costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher fuel costs, an increase in labor and overburden removal expenses and higher contractor costs (five of ten Australian mines are managed utilizing contract miners). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 over the prior year due to increased trading volumes and higher coal price volatility. 51 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.5 $ 1,078.1 $ 1,016.4 94.3 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (247.2 ) (109.5 ) (137.7 ) (125.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (406.2 ) (352.2 ) (54.0 ) (15.3 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.2 ) (23.7 ) (24.5 ) (103.4 )% Interest expense (226.2 ) (235.0 ) 8.8 3.7 % Interest income 10.1 7.1 3.0 42.3 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,176.8 $ 364.8 $ 812.0 222.6 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests increased over the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, and higher asset retirement obligation expense. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. The decrease in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the following: Higher selling and administrative expenses ($54.7 million) primarily driven by an increase in performance based incentive costs and legal expenses; Cost reimbursement and partner fees received in the prior year for the Prairie State project, primarily related to the entrance of new project partners ($29.5 million); Lower net gains on disposals or exchanges of assets ($15.7 million). 2008 activity included a gain of $54.0 million on the sale of approximately 58 million tons of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. 2007 activity included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of oil and gas rights and assets in more than 860,000 acres in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for coal reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. The prior year also included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands to the Prairie State equity partners; and Lower equity income ($15.5 million) from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela) and higher costs associated with Btu Conversion activities of $14.3 million in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was higher in 2008 compared to the prior year because of increased depletion across our operating platform resulting from the volume increases and the impact of mining higher value coal reserves. In addition, depreciation and depletion increases resulted from our recently completed Australian mines and depletion at our El Segundo Mine. Asset retirement obligation expense increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to an increase in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates that reflect higher fuel, labor and re vegetation costs, as well as an overall increase in the number of acres disturbed. The addition of the El Segundo Mine, which was completed in June 2008, also contributed to higher asset retirement obligation expense. 52 Table of Contents Net Income The following table presents net income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,176.8 $ 364.8 $ 812.0 222.6 % Income tax (provision) benefit (185.8 ) 72.9 (258.7 ) (354.9 )% Minority interests (6.2 ) 2.3 (8.5 ) (369.6 )% Income from continuing operations 984.8 440.0 544.8 123.8 % Loss from discontinued operations (31.3 ) (175.7 ) 144.4 82.2 % Net income $ 953.5 $ 264.3 $ 689.2 260.8 % Net income increased in 2008 compared to the prior year due to the increase in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes and minority interests discussed above. The tax provision increase over the prior year is the result of the current year increased pre tax earnings ($292.6 million) combined with the valuation allowance release against federal net operating loss credits recognized into income in the prior year ($197.8 million). These increases were partially offset by the non cash tax benefit from the remeasurement of non U.S. dollar denominated income tax accounts as a result of the strengthening of the Australian dollar in 2007 as compared to weakening of the Australian dollar in 2008 ($121.3 million), the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income ($110.8 million) and the release of a valuation allowance against a portion of our Australia net operating loss carryforwards in the current year ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a lower loss from discontinued operations as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred for Patriot operations in 2007. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 related to operating losses, net of a gain on sale of assets previously held for sale ($19.6 million) and an $11.7 million write off of an excise tax refund receivable (net of tax) as a result of an April 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Summary Higher average sales prices across all U.S. regions and increased volumes, primarily from Australian Mining operations, contributed to a 12.2% increase in revenues to $4.55 billion compared to 2006. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.8% to $1.08 billion primarily on higher prices in the Western U.S. Mining operations and increased results from Trading and Brokerage operations. Increases in sales volumes and prices in our U.S. mining operations were partially offset by challenges experienced during the period such as ongoing shipping constraints from port congestion in Australia; geologic and equipment issues, higher commodity costs, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar. Also, negatively impacting Australian Mining results was lower metallurgical coal prices associated with annual contracts that began in April 2007. Income from continuing operations was $440.0 million in 2007, or $1.63 per diluted share, a decrease of 22.8% from 2006 income from continuing operations of $569.9 million, or $2.12 per diluted share. 53 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2007 2006 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 161.4 160.5 0.9 0.6 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 29.6 28.7 0.9 3.1 % Australian Mining 21.0 10.8 10.2 94.4 % Trading and Brokerage 24.1 21.4 2.7 12.6 % Total tons sold 236.1 221.4 14.7 6.6 % Revenues The table below presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,063.2 $ 1,703.4 $ 359.8 21.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 987.1 858.5 128.6 15.0 % Australian Mining 1,138.9 833.0 305.9 36.7 % Trading and Brokerage 320.7 652.0 (331.3 ) (50.8 )% Other 35.2 4.0 31.2 780.0 % Total revenues $ 4,545.1 $ 4,050.9 $ 494.2 12.2 % Total revenues increased in 2007 compared to 2006 across all mining operations. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: Prices in our Western U.S. Mining operations increased due to a sales realization increase of approximately 29% for our premium Powder River Basin product and an average increase across all U.S. regions of 16%. Midwestern U.S. Mining revenues increased due to higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants as those plants were idled for part of 2006. Increased volumes from our Australian Mining operations. Volumes related to operations acquired in the October 2006 Excel acquisition accounted for 10.9 million tons of the increase to tons sold. Offsetting this increase was lower average sales prices in our Australian Mining operations related to lower metallurgical contract pricing and a significant change in sales mix resulting in higher thermal export and domestic product sales. Volumes were unfavorably impacted at some of our Australian Mining operations as a result of damaged rails and further amplified port and rail congestion throughout the year, in addition to adverse weather events that affected production. Partially offsetting sales price and volume increases was the continued shift towards trading contracts versus brokerage contracts in our Trading and Brokerage operations. Trading and Brokerage operations sales decreased during 2007 as the amount of brokerage business was reduced and replacement business was in the form of traded contracts. Contracts for trading activity are recorded at net margin in other revenues, whereas contracts for brokerage activity are recorded at gross sales price to revenues and operating costs. 54 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 595.4 $ 473.1 $ 122.3 25.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 200.0 186.2 13.8 7.4 % Australian Mining 166.1 286.8 (120.7 ) (42.1 )% Trading and Brokerage 116.6 92.6 24.0 25.9 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,078.1 $ 1,038.7 $ 39.4 3.8 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2007 over 2006 primarily related to the overall increase in average sales prices from our Powder River Basin operations. Partially offsetting higher average sales prices were higher costs associated with equipment repairs and maintenance and higher add on taxes and royalties driven by higher sales prices compared to the prior year, mine shutdown for maintenance in our Colorado mine, higher fuel costs and adverse weather conditions in the Powder River Basin and capital project delays. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2007 over 2006 as both volumes and prices per ton saw moderate increases. Results improved compared to 2006 as benefits of higher volumes and sales prices were offset by higher costs for commodities, including fuel. The 2007 results were also positively impacted by higher revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel facilities of $12.5 million as customers idled their synthetic fuel plants for a portion of 2006. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to approximately $31 million of higher costs resulting from the weakening U.S. dollar (higher costs of approximately $112 million were offset by hedging gains of $81 million); higher congestion related demurrage costs (approximately $50 million); lower pricing on annually repriced metallurgical coal contracts; and, rail and port congestion at Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal and the Port of Newcastle. Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal had been experiencing queues of over 41 vessels (approximately a 24 day load time) down from 50 vessels in the second quarter (approximately a 34 day delay). Partially offsetting these decreases were the full year contributions from our mines acquired in the Excel acquisition and a $6.3 million insurance recovery on a business interruption claim in the first half of 2007. Our Australian mines acquired in 2006 experienced shipping difficulties and damaged rail lines resulting from a storm late in 2007. The Port of Newcastle was closed for several days in 2007 due to a storm, with up to 79 vessels in the queue (a 35 40 day wait). Trading and Brokerage operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2007 over 2006 as the results reflected higher international trading gains, resulting from higher volumes and pricing due to expanded global trading activities, strong supply/demand fundamentals and tightened seaborne market conditions. 55 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The following table presents income before income taxes and minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,078.1 $ 1,038.7 $ 39.4 3.8 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (109.5 ) (127.7 ) 18.2 14.3 % Depreciation, depletion and amortization (352.2 ) (284.2 ) (68.0 ) (23.9 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (23.7 ) (14.2 ) (9.5 ) (66.9 )% Interest expense (235.0 ) (139.1 ) (95.9 ) (68.9 )% Interest income 7.1 11.3 (4.2 ) (37.2 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests $ 364.8 $ 484.8 $ (120.0 ) (24.8 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests in 2007 was lower than 2006 primarily due to higher interest expense and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization related to the acquisition of Excel in late 2006. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development, Btu Conversion development and resource management. The improvement in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA in 2007 compared to 2006 includes the following: Higher gains on asset disposals and exchanges of $35.1 million. The 2007 activity included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves to the Prairie State equity partners. Our 2007 activity also included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of our coalbed methane and oil and gas rights in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for high Btu coal reserves located in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. In comparison, the 2006 activity included a $39.2 million gain on an exchange with the Bureau of Land Management of approximately 63 million tons of leased coal reserves at our Caballo mining operation for approximately 46 million tons of coal reserves contiguous with our North Antelope Rochelle mining operation and other gains on asset disposals totaling $14.3 million; Higher past mining obligation expenses of $15.5 million resulting from increased retiree healthcare costs due to higher than anticipated healthcare utilization by retirees, particularly related to prescription drugs; Higher selling and administrative expenses of $19.1 million primarily resulting from the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and other corporate development initiatives; and Lower equity income of $6.8 million from our 25.5% interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela), which primarily resulted from trucking issues experienced earlier in the year, a temporary shortage of explosives and delays in receiving equipment, which impacted operations. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $68.0 million primarily related to the addition of the Australian operations acquired in late 2006. Interest expense increased $95.9 million primarily due to approximately $1.8 billion in new debt issued or assumed as part of the Excel acquisition in the second half of 2006. 56 Table of Contents Net Income The following table presents net income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2007 2006 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 364.8 $ 484.8 $ (120.0 ) (24.8 )% Income tax benefit 72.9 85.7 (12.8 ) (14.9 )% Minority interests 2.3 (0.6 ) 2.9 483.3 % Income from continuing operations 440.0 569.9 (129.9 ) (22.8 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations (175.7 ) 30.8 (206.5 ) (670.5 )% Net income $ 264.3 $ 600.7 $ (336.4 ) (56.0 )% Income from continuing operations decreased in 2007 compared to prior year due to the decrease in income before income taxes and minority interests discussed above and a lower income tax benefit compared to 2006. The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended 2007 related primarily to a $56.0 million foreign currency impact on deferred taxes as a result of increases in Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rates and $33.2 million lower tax reserves than in 2006. This decrease was partially offset by lower pre tax income, a $10.3 million increase in released valuation allowances and $24.3 million of additional tax credits. Minority interests increased primarily from the absorption of losses in excess of the minority interest capital contribution at one of our mines, partially offset by lower earnings allocable to partners. Outlook Near Term Outlook The current global financial slowdown has reduced gross domestic product expectations for U.S., China and other major world economies, which is expected to temper the growth of coal demand in the near term. As a result, we expect our 2009 prices to be lower than 2008 levels for our unpriced 2009 Australian based metallurgical and thermal coal (see further discussion of unpriced coal below). Fourth quarter 2008 global steel production declined 19% compared to fourth quarter 2007 due to the softening worldwide economies. Steel production in 2009 is anticipated to be as much as 20% lower than 2008. We estimate lower steel production will reduce 2009 seaborne metallurgical coal demand up to 40 million metric tonnes. In response to expected declines in demand, met coal producers have been reducing planned production levels. As of January 2009, approximately 30 million metric tonnes of seaborne met coal production cuts have been announced. In January 2009, we announced planned production cuts of up to 2 million tons of Australian based metallurgical coal to match expected changes in demand due to the global recession. As of January 2009, we have 4 to 5 million tons of expected Australian based metallurgical coal production available to be priced for the last three quarters of 2009. By the end of 2008, published thermal coal prices in most major markets declined from their mid 2008 highs, largely reversing gains from the first half of 2008. The decline was initiated by the accelerated liquidation of positions by financial counterparties that was followed by mild weather across the northern hemisphere during the third quarter of 2008 and the onset of the global economic downturn over the second half of the year. As of January 2009, we have 5 to 6 million tons of Australian based thermal coal available to be priced for the last three quarters of 2009. In the U.S., declining gross domestic product is expected to lead to reduced electricity demand for 2009. In addition, higher than normal stockpiles, low natural gas prices and lower U.S. exports could dampen 2009 U.S. coal demand by up to 60 to 70 million tons. U.S. coal production is adjusting to anticipated changes in 57 Table of Contents demand, with approximately 40 million tons of announced production cuts from 50% of the U.S. production base as of January 2009. In January 2009, we announced planned reductions in 2009 Powder River Basin production of 10 million tons to better match production with expected demand. Our U.S. production is largely sold out for 2009. We are targeting full year 2009 production of 190 to 195 million tons in the U.S. and 22 to 24 million tons in Australia with total sales in the range of 230 to 250 million tons. We rely on ongoing access to the worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. We continue to manage costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potentially adverse port and rail performance. We have experienced increases in operating costs related to fuel, explosives, steel, tires, contract mining and healthcare, and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs, including a company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. Long term Outlook Given the current global economic conditions, the near term is less certain. However, our long term outlook remains positive. Coal has been the fastest growing fuel for each of the past five years, with consumption growing nearly twice as fast as total energy use. The IEAs World Energy Outlook estimates world primary energy demand will grow 45% between 2006 and 2030, with demand for coal rising more than any other fuel and comprising more than a third of the expected increase in energy use. China and India alone account for more than half of the expected incremental energy demand. Currently, 200 gigawatts of coal fired electricity generating plants are under construction around the world, representing nearly 700 million tons of annual coal demand expected to come online in the next several years. In the U.S., 30 units are currently under construction in 19 states, representing more than 16 gigawatts of capacity and approximately 70 million tons of annual coal demand. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as coal to gas (CTG) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants represent a significant avenue for potential long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel, including CTL, which is estimated to add 70 million tons of annual U.S. coal demand by 2030. In addition, China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. Enactment of laws and passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit carbon dioxide emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. We continue to support clean coal technology development and voluntary initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation as a founding member of the FutureGen Alliance and the Australian COAL21 Fund, and through our participation in the Power Systems Development Facility, the PowerTree Carbon Company LLC, the Midwest Geopolitical Sequestration Consortium and the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate. In addition, we are the only non Chinese equity partner in GreenGen, a planned near zero emissions coal fueled power plant with carbon capture and storage which is under development in China. 58 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of federal law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $74.4 million, while funding payments were $89.5 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 6.6 $ (5.7 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 79.7 $ (68.5 ) Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.8 $ (0.8 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (39.1 ) $ 41.1 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 10.68 years at December 31, 2008. 59 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $48.2 million, and payments totaled $11.4 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109), which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Interpretation No. 48 (FIN No. 48) Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109) prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the effect of income taxes. Revenue Recognition In general, we recognize revenues when they are realizable and earned. We generated 92% of our revenue in 2008 from the sale of coal to our customers. Revenue from coal sales is realized and earned when risk of loss passes to the customer. Under the typical terms of our coal supply agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to the customer at the mine or port, where coal is loaded to the rail, barge, ocean going vessel, truck or other transportation source(s) that delivers coal to its destination. With respect to other revenues, other operating income, or gains on asset sales recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal, we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and apply the relevant accounting literature as appropriate, and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Trading Activities We engage in the buying and selling of coal, freight and emissions allowances, both in over the counter markets and on exchanges. Under the provision of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, all derivative coal trading contracts are accounted for on a fair value (as defined by SFAS No. 157) basis, except those that qualify for and the Company has elected to apply a normal purchases and normal sales exception. For certain of our derivative coal trading contracts, we establish fair values using bid/ask price quotations obtained from multiple, independent third party brokers to value coal, freight and 60 Table of Contents emission allowance positions from the over the counter market. Prices from these sources are then averaged to obtain trading position values. We could experience difficulty in valuing our market positions if the number of third party brokers should decrease or market liquidity is reduced. For our exchange based positions, we utilize published settlement prices. Non derivative coal contracts, including those that qualify for and the Company has elected to apply a normal purchases and normal sales exception, are accounted for on an accrual basis. As of December 31, 2008, 94% of the contracts in our trading portfolio were valued utilizing prices from over the counter market sources, adjusted for coal quality and traded transportation differentials. As of December 31, 2008, 75% of the estimated future value of our trading portfolio was scheduled to be realized by the end of 2009 and 88% within 24 months. See Note 3 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding assets and liabilities from our coal trading activities. Fair Value Measurements We use various methods to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using market quoted inputs for valuation or corroboration as available. We utilize market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the particular asset or liability, including assumptions about inherent risk. We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements utilizing the best available information. We consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three hierarchy levels, Level 1, 2 and 3, as prescribed by SFAS No. 157 (see Note 3 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those which our positions extend out to periods where there is low trade activity or where broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include quotes from one to three reputable brokers where forward pricing curves are projected. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts, which are categorized by level in the table below. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. Net assets (liabilities) related to coal trading activities at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: December 31, Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Level 1 $ (17.0 ) $ 5.9 $ (22.9 ) Level 2 337.8 (86.6 ) 424.4 Level 3 37.8 128.7 (90.9 ) Total $ 358.6 $ 48.0 $ 310.6 61 Table of Contents Our coal trading platform includes positions designed to secure forward pricing for some of our production (i.e. cash flow hedges wherein the effective portion of the change in the fair value is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until the hedged transaction occurs) as well as positions designed to generate current period trading results. Overall pricing increases since December 31, 2007 and higher trading volumes, particularly from our international trading activities, have increased the value of our coal trading portfolio during 2008. As a result, segment Adjusted EBITDA from our Trading and Brokerage segment totaled $218.9 million compared to $116.6 million in 2007. The fair value of coal trading positions designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated future sales was an asset of $220.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and a liability of $44.1 million as of December 31, 2007 (primarily classified as Level 2). The estimated realization of our aggregate coal trading portfolio of $358.6 million is 75% in 2009 and 88% within two years. Level 3 Net Financial Asset (Liability) Detail The Level 3 net financial assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2008 are as follows: Net financial assets (liabilities) (Dollars in millions) Physical commodity purchase/sale contracts coal trading activities $ 38.9 Commodity swaps and options coal trading activities (1.1 ) Total net Level 3 financial assets $ 37.8 Total net financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value $ (129.2 ) Percent of Level 3 net financial assets to total net financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value Not meaningful(1 ) (1) Percentage of Level 3 net financial assets compared to total net financial assets (liabilities) is not meaningful due to overall liability position as of December 31, 2008. The following table summarizes the changes in our recurring Level 3 net financial assets: Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Beginning of period $ 128.7 Total gains or losses (realized/unrealized): Included in earnings (9.8 ) Included in other comprehensive income 3.4 Purchases, issuances and settlements (58.8 ) Net transfers out (25.7 ) December 31, 2008 $ 37.8 The following table summarizes the changes in unrealized gains (losses) relating to Level 3 net financial assets still held as January 1 and December 31, 2008: Year Ended December 31, 2008 (Dollars in millions) Changes in unrealized losses(1) $ (34.8 ) (1) For the periods presented, unrealized gains and losses from Level 3 items are offset by unrealized gains and losses on positions classified in Level 1 or 2, as well as other positions that have been realized during the applicable periods. 62 Table of Contents Exploration and Drilling Costs Exploration expenditures are charged to operating costs as incurred, including costs related to drilling and study costs incurred to convert or upgrade mineral resources to reserves. Advance Stripping Costs Pre production: At existing surface operations, additional pits may be added to increase production capacity in order to meet customer requirements. These expansions may require significant capital to purchase additional equipment, expand the workforce, build or improve existing haul roads and create the initial pre production box cut to remove overburden (i.e., advance stripping costs) for new pits at existing operations. If these pits operate in a separate and distinct area of the mine, the costs associated with initially uncovering coal (i.e., advance stripping costs incurred for the initial box cuts) for production are capitalized and amortized over the life of the developed pit consistent with coal industry practices. Post production: Advance stripping costs related to post production are expensed as incurred. Where new pits are routinely developed as part of a contiguous mining sequence, we expense such costs as incurred. The development of a contiguous pit typically reflects the planned progression of an existing pit, thus maintaining production levels from the same mining area utilizing the same employee group and equipment. Share Based Compensation We account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), which we adopted using the modified prospective option on January 1, 2006. Under SFAS No. 123(R), share based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award. We utilize restricted stock, nonqualified stock options, performance units, deferred stock units and an employee stock purchase plan as part of our share based compensation program. Determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions, including items such as expected term, risk free rate, forfeiture rate and expected volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable (through our securitization program). Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, federal coal lease payments, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of our 5.875% and 6.875% Senior Notes and Debentures. We generally fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. We believe our available borrowing capicity and operating cash flows will be sufficient in the near term. As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. Our two defined benefit pension plans, which have approximately 45% of their assets invested in equity securities, experienced negative returns in 2008 due to recent equity market performance. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Protection Act), which was effective January 1, 2008, increased the long term funding targets for single employer pension plans from 90% to 100%. In addition, the Pension Protection 63 Table of Contents Act restricts at risk (generally defined as under 80% funded) plans from making lump sum payments and increasing benefits unless they are funded immediately, and also requires that the plan give participants notice regarding the at risk status of the plan. If a plan falls below 60%, lump sum payments are prohibited and participant benefit accruals cease. As of December 31, 2008, our pension plans were approximately 68% funded, before considering planned 2009 contributions. Our minimum funding requirement for 2009 is approximately $25 million, and would result in a funded status above 70%. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2008 increased $956.1 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily related to a current year increase in operating cash flows generated from our Australian mining operations and the timing of cash flows for working capital driven by an increase in income tax amounts that will be payable in future periods. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased $7.4 million in 2008 compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower capital spending of $160.5 million in 2008, mostly offset by the acquisition of minority interests of $110.1 million relating to our Millennium Mine, and a decrease in cash proceeds of $46.8 million, net of notes receivable, related to asset disposals. Net cash used in financing activities reflects a use of $375.8 million in 2008 compared to $44.7 million of cash provided by financing activities in 2007. The increase in the use of cash in 2008 is primarily due to the repurchase of $199.8 million of our outstanding common stock, $97.7 million to repay the borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility, and debt repayments of $32.7 million, including payments of $18.8 million on our Term Loan under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. During 2007, we repaid $37.9 million of our Term Loan and purchased in the open market $13.8 million face value of our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016. We also made the final principal payment of $59.5 million on our 5% Subordinated Note. Our Revolving Credit Facility balance increased $97.7 million in 2007 as it was utilized to fund cash contributions to Patriot at the spin off date. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 consisted of the following: December 31, 2008 2007 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 490.3 $ 509.1 Revolving Credit Facility 97.7 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 732.5 732.5 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 650.0 650.0 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 650.0 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 247.0 247.0 5.875% Senior Notes due 2016 218.1 218.1 6.84% Series C Bonds due 2016 43.0 43.0 6.34% Series B Bonds due 2014 18.0 21.0 6.84% Series A Bonds due 2014 10.0 10.0 Capital lease obligations 81.2 92.2 Fair value hedge adjustment 15.1 1.6 Other 1.0 0.9 Total $ 3,156.2 $ 3,273.1 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2008. 64 Table of Contents Senior Unsecured Credit Facility In September 2006, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which established a $2.75 billion Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and which amended and restated in full our then existing $1.35 billion Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Currently, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is LIBOR plus 0.75%, which at December 31, 2008 was 2.2%. Under the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The new facility is less restrictive with respect to limitations on our dividend payments, capital expenditures, asset sales or stock repurchases. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2008, we had no borrowings and $245.1 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Our Revolving Credit Facility is primarily used for standby letters of credit and short term working capital needs. The remaining available borrowing capacity ($1.5 billion as of December 31, 2008) can be used to fund strategic acquisitions or meet other financing needs, including additional standby letters of credit. Other Long Term Debt A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Third party Security Ratings The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on our Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement On July 28, 2006, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, 65 Table of Contents debt securities, warrants and units. The Debentures, 7.375% Senior Notes due 2016 and 7.875% Senior Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to the shelf registration statement. Share Repurchase Program In July 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 5% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, approximately 13 million shares. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. In addition, our Board of Directors had previously authorized our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside the repurchase program. In October 2008, our Board of Directors amended the share repurchase program to increase the total authorized amount to $1 billion. The amended repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. In 2008, we repurchased 5.5 million of our common shares for $199.8 million under this repurchase program and in 2006, we repurchased 2.2 million of our common shares for $99.8 million under this repurchase program. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,356.1 $ 198.5 $ 861.8 $ 1,004.1 $ 3,291.8 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 99.4 19.1 30.2 38.1 12.0 Operating lease obligations 409.2 76.3 132.5 73.6 126.8 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 38.5 38.5 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 193.9 134.1 15.1 11.5 33.2 Other long term liabilities(2) 1,513.1 192.7 216.5 178.2 925.7 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,610.2 $ 659.2 $ 1,256.1 $ 1,305.5 $ 4,389.5 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to significant capital purchases. (2) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2008, we had $38.5 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $124.6 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next five years. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures primarily relate to the replacement and improvement of equipment and facilities at existing mines. We expect to fund capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flow. We do not expect any of the $186.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as 66 Table of Contents bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (such as self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2008: Workers Reclamation Lease Compensation Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self Bonding $ 773.4 $ $ $ $ 773.4 Surety Bonds 740.6 99.2 19.3 15.2 874.3 Letters of Credit 0.1 54.9 199.3 254.3 $ 1,514.1 $ 99.2 $ 74.2 $ 214.5 $ 1,902.0 (1) Other includes the four letter of credit obligations described below and an additional $24.3 million in self bonding, letters of credit and surety bonds related to collateral for surety companies, road maintenance, performance guarantees and other operations. We own a 37.5% interest in a partnership that leases a coal export terminal from the Peninsula Ports Authority of Virginia under a 30 year lease that permits the partnership to purchase the terminal at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount. The partners have severally (but not jointly) agreed to make payments under various agreements which in the aggregate provide the partnership with sufficient funds to pay rents and to cover the principal and interest payments on the floating rate industrial revenue bonds issued by the Peninsula Ports Authority, and which are supported by letters of credit from a commercial bank. As of December 31, 2008, our maximum reimbursement obligation to the commercial bank was in turn supported by two letters of credit totaling $42.8 million. We are party to an agreement with the PBGC and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make special contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.) and continues under this process as of December 31, 2008. As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. At December 31, 2008, we have a $110.4 million letter of credit for collateral for bank guarantees issued with respect to certain reclamation and performance obligations related to the mines acquired in the Excel acquisition. Other Guarantees As part of arrangements through which we obtain exclusive sales representation agreements with small coal mining companies (the Counterparties), we issued financial guarantees on behalf of the Counterparties. These guarantees facilitate the Counterparties efforts to obtain bonding or financing. In the event of default, we have multiple recourse options, including the ability to assume the loans and procure title and use of the equipment purchased through the loans. If default occurs, we have the ability and intent to exercise our recourse options, so the liability associated with the guarantee has been valued at zero. The aggregate amount 67 Table of Contents guaranteed by us for all such Counterparties was $10.0 million at December 31, 2008. Our obligations under the guarantees extend to September 2013. As part of the Patriot spin off, we agreed to maintain several letters of credit that secured Patriot obligations for certain employee benefits and workers compensation obligations. These letters of credit are to be released upon Patriot satisfying the beneficiaries with alternate letters of credit or insurance. If Patriot is unable to satisfy the primary beneficiaries by June 30, 2011, they are then required to provide directly to us a letter of credit in the amount of the remaining obligation. The amount of letters of credit maintained by us securing Patriot obligations was $7.0 million at December 31, 2008 and $136.8 million at December 31, 2007. Under our accounts receivable securitization program, undivided interests in a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary are sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The securitization program and the underlying facilities will effectively expire in May 2009. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with those accounts receivable sold to the Conduit removed from the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of undivided interests in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $275.0 million as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounts receivable securitization). Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, emission allowances, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk analysis (described below). Value at risk analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter and direct trading of coal and ocean freight. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, in value at risk terms, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties, such as forwards, options and swaps, at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards and swaps as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. We perform a value at risk analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes over the counter and brokerage trading of coal. The use of value at risk allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, the price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. Value at risk represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified 68 Table of Contents confidence level. Our value at risk model is based on the industry standard variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to option, swap and forward positions. Our value at risk model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the value at risk estimates during the liquidation period. During 2008, we implemented a change to our volatility calculation by incorporating an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days. This algorithm makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. The use of value at risk allows management to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the value at risk methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analysis to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our value at risk measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the value at risk methodology and identify additional market related risks. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to value at risk and to better reflect current asset and liability volatilities. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe value at risk is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. An inherent limitation of value at risk is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. Value at risk should be evaluated in light of this limitation. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the combined actual low, high, and average values at risk for our coal trading portfolio were $8.5 million, $27.2 million, and $19.1 million, respectively. Our value at risk increased over the prior year due to greater price volatility in the eastern U.S. and international coal markets. As of December 31, 2008, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage Expiration of Portfolio 2009 75 % 2010 13 % 2011 11 % 2012 1 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Performance and Credit Risk Our concentration of performance and credit risk is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay. In general, increases in coal price volatility and our own trading activity resulted in greater exposure to our coal trading counterparties during 2008. In addition to credit risk, performance risk includes the possibility that a counterparty fails to deliver agreed production or trading volumes. When appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include 69 Table of Contents obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of failure to pay. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into agreements that include netting language with counterparties that permit us to offset trading positions, receivables, and payables with such counterparties. We conduct our various hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate management, and fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks. In light of the recent turmoil in the financial markets we continue to closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. Our currency hedging program for 2009 targets hedging approximately 70% of our anticipated Australian dollar denominated operating expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a five cent change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $84.0 million for 2009. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $25.9 million for 2009. The chart at the end of Item 7A. shows the notional amount of our forward contracts as of December 31, 2008. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.5 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $691.2 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of $6.9 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $145.2 million decrease in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements, rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 90% and 87% of our worldwide sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of January 27, 2009, we have largely sold out expected 2009 U.S. production. We had 9 to 11 million tons remaining to be priced for 2009 in Australia at January 27, 2009. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges Some of the products used in our mining activities, such as diesel fuel and explosives, are subject to commodity price risk. To manage this risk, we use a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, which are primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. As of December 31, 2008, we had derivative contracts outstanding that are designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases of fuel and explosives. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 125 to 130 million gallons of fuel next year. A $10 dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs (ignoring the effects of hedging) by approximately $31 million. 70 Table of Contents Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the chart below. We expect to consume 335,000 to 345,000 tons of explosives per year in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included with the fees paid to our contract miners. Based on our expected usage, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu (ignoring the effects of hedging) would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $7 million.
