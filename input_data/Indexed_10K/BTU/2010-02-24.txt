Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Share Repurchases Our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer also has the authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside the share repurchase program. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Through December 31, 2009, we have made repurchases of 7.7 million shares at a cost of $299.6 million, leaving $700.4 million available for share repurchase under the program. 34 Table of Contents The following table summarizes all share repurchases for the three months ended December 31, 2009: Maximum Dollar Value that May Yet Total Number of Be Used to Total Shares Purchased Repurchase Number of Average as Part of Publicly Shares Under the Shares Price per Announced Publicly Announced Period Purchased(1) Share Program Program (in millions) October 1 through October 31, 2009 558 $ 43.37 $ 700.4 November 1 through November 30, 2009 1,358 39.59 $ 700.4 December 1 through December 31, 2009 570 45.21 $ 700.4 Total 2,486 $ 41.73 (1) Represents 2,486 shares withheld to cover the withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock. Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected financial and other data about us for the most recent five fiscal years. The following table and the discussion of our results of operations in 2009, 2008 and 2007 in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as reflected at the end of Item 6. Selected Financial Data. and in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations those operations recently divested, as well as certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets. In October 2006, we acquired Excel. Our results of operations include Excels results of operations from the date of acquisition. We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 from our audited financial statements. You should read the following table in conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 35 Table of Contents The results of operations for the historical periods included in the following table are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the worlds largest private sector coal company, with majority interests in 28 coal mining operations in the U.S. and Australia. In 2009, we produced 210.0 million tons of coal and sold 243.6 million tons of coal. For 2009, our U.S. sales represented 19% of U.S. coal consumption and were approximately 50% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining Segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. In 2009, metallurgical coal was approximately 3% of our total sales volume, but represented a larger share of our revenue, approximately 23%. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2009, approximately 93% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, 81% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 17% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations. Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, as well as the management of our vast coal reserve and real estate holdings. We continue to pursue development of coal fueled generating and Btu Conversion projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. Coal fueled generating projects may involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. Currently, we own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. We are determining how to best participate in Btu Conversion technologies to economically convert our coal resources to natural gas and transportation fuels through the Kentucky NewGas and GreatPoint Energy projects in the U.S. We are also advancing the development of clean coal technologies, including carbon 37 Table of Contents capture and sequestration, through a number of initiatives that include the FutureGen Alliance and university research programs in the U.S., GreenGen in China and COAL21 Fund in Australia. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by the rate of the economic recovery, adverse weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Summary Our overall results for 2009 compared to 2008 reflect the unfavorable impact of lower global demand for coal as a result of the global economic recession. Despite the recession, our 2009 Adjusted EBITDA was the second highest in our 126 year history and second only to our 2008 Adjusted EBITDA. We also ended 2009 with total available liquidity of $2.5 billion. We continue to focus on strong cost control and productivity improvements, increased contributions from our high margin operations and exercising tight capital discipline. Our 2009 tons sold were below prior year levels reflecting planned production reductions in the Powder River Basin to match lower demand, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the full year operation of our El Segundo Mine in the Southwest. In the U.S., the decreased demand from lower industrial output, lower natural gas prices that resulted in higher fuel switching, and higher coal stockpiles in the U.S. led to an 8.5 million ton decline in sales volume. In Australia, lower demand from steel customers resulted in a 1.3 million ton decline in metallurgical coal volume, although volumes in the second half of 2009 began to increase on an improved economic outlook led by demand from Asian Pacific markets. Our 2009 revenues declined compared to 2008 and were primarily impacted by Australias lower annual export contract pricing that commenced on April 1, 2009 as compared to 2008s record pricing and the overall decline in volume. Lower revenues were also driven by the decline in Trading and Brokerage revenues that resulted from lower coal pricing volatility. The lower Australian and Trading and Brokerage revenues were partially offset by an increase in U.S. revenues per ton that reflect multi year contracts signed at higher prices in recent years. While our Segment Adjusted EBITDA reflects the lower revenue discussed above, our 2009 margins also reflect the impact of producing at reduced levels as well as higher sales related costs. In addition, our costs in Australia were higher due to two additional longwall moves compared to 2008 and the impact of mining in difficult geologic conditions that also included higher costs for overburden removal. Net income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the above items, as well as lower results from equity affiliates and decreased net gains on disposals of assets. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $457.9 million in 2009, or $1.64 per diluted share, 53.6% below 2008 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $987.9 million, or $3.60 per diluted share. 38 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 160.1 169.7 (9.6 ) (5.7 )% Midwestern U.S. Mining 31.8 30.7 1.1 3.6 % Australian Mining 22.3 23.4 (1.1 ) (4.7 )% Trading and Brokerage 29.4 31.2 (1.8 ) (5.8 )% Total tons sold 243.6 255.0 (11.4 ) (4.5 )% Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,612.6 $ 2,533.1 $ 79.5 3.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,303.8 1,154.6 149.2 12.9 % Australian Mining 1,678.0 2,242.8 (564.8 ) (25.2 )% Trading and Brokerage 391.0 601.8 (210.8 ) (35.0 )% Other 27.0 28.7 (1.7 ) (5.9 )% Total revenues $ 6,012.4 $ 6,561.0 $ (548.6 ) (8.4 )% 2009 revenues were below prior year driven by decreases in our Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage segments as discussed below: Australian Mining operations average sales price decreased 21.4% from the prior year reflecting the lower annual export contract pricing that commenced April 1, 2009 compared to the record pricing realized in 2008. The price decreases were combined with volume decreases from the prior year (4.7%) due to overall lower demand experienced in the first half of 2009. 2009 metallurgical coal shipments of 6.9 million tons were 1.3 million tons below prior year. In the second half of 2009, 5.0 million tons of metallurgical coal were shipped, reflecting a partial recovery from the lower metallurgical coal shipments that occurred in the first half of the year. Trading and Brokerage revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower coal pricing volatility in 2009 resulting in lower margins on trading transactions, partially offset by profit from business contracted in 2008 that was realized in 2009 on an international brokerage arrangement. These decreases to revenues were partially offset by revenue increases in our Midwestern U.S. and Western U.S. Mining segments as discussed below: Midwestern U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.3%) driven by the benefit of higher Illinois Basin prices and increased shipments, including purchased coal used to satisfy certain coal supply agreements. Western U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.2%) due to a combination of higher contract pricing and a shift in sales mix. Revenues were also higher due to increased shipments from our El Segundo Mine (commissioned in June 2008) and customer contract termination and restructuring agreements. These increases were partially offset by the prior year 39 Table of Contents revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million) and an overall volume decrease (5.7%) reflecting our planned Powder River Basin production decreases to match demand. Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 721.5 $ 681.3 $ 40.2 5.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 281.9 177.3 104.6 59.0 % Australian Mining 437.8 1,016.6 (578.8 ) (56.9 )% Trading and Brokerage 193.4 218.9 (25.5 ) (11.6 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year due to lower annual export contract pricing and lower sales volume due to reduced demand ($416.0 million) as discussed above. Also impacting the segments Adjusted EBITDA was higher production costs ($170.7 million) driven by increased overburden stripping ratios and decreased longwall mine performance, which included higher costs associated with two additional longwall moves in 2009 compared to 2008. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to prior year primarily due to lower net revenue discussed above. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher pricing ($205.5 million), partially offset by lower demand ($63.2 million), a prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million), higher sales related costs ($52.0 million) and lower productivity due to increased stripping ratios ($20.8 million). The impact of lower demand was partially mitigated by revenues from customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million). Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year primarily due to higher pricing ($110.7 million) and decreased commodity costs ($16.0 million), partially offset by higher costs associated with mining in more difficult geological conditions compared to the prior year ($20.7 million). Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (344.5 ) (247.2 ) (97.3 ) (39.4 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (405.2 ) (402.4 ) (2.8 ) (0.7 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (40.1 ) (48.2 ) 8.1 16.8 % Interest expense (201.2 ) (227.0 ) 25.8 11.4 % Interest income 8.1 10.0 (1.9 ) (19.0 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% 40 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from prior year primarily due to the lower Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above and lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense and asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease of $97.3 million in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the following: Lower results from equity affiliates ($69.1 million) primarily from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela). Carbones del Guasare incurred unfavorable results in 2009 compared to 2008 (our share of which was $25.6 million) due to lower productivity, higher operating costs and ongoing labor issues; in addition, we recognized a $34.7 million impairment loss on this investment. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning this joint venture interest. Lower net gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($49.7 million) was due primarily to a $54.0 million gain in the prior year from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. The above decreases to Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA were offset by lower costs associated with Btu Conversion activities ($16.9 million). Interest expense was lower than prior year due to lower variable interest rates on our Term Loan Facility and accounts receivable securitization program and lower average borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates reflecting lower fuel and re vegetation costs incurred in our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% Income tax provision (193.8 ) (191.4 ) (2.4 ) (1.3 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 457.9 987.9 (530.0 ) (53.6 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5.1 (28.8 ) 33.9 117.7 % Net income 463.0 959.1 (496.1 ) (51.7 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14.8 ) (6.2 ) (8.6 ) (138.7 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 448.2 $ 952.9 $ (504.7 ) (53.0 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. 41 Table of Contents Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the strengthening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar ($139.6 million; exchange rate rose 29% in 2009 compared to a 21% decrease in 2008, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.2041 $ (0.1888 ) The prior year release of a foreign valuation allowance related to our Australian net operating loss carry forwards ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. The above increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower pre tax earnings in 2009, which drove a decrease to the income tax provision ($184.6 million). Income from discontinued operations increased compared to the prior year as the prior year included operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine, and an $11.7 million write off of a coal excise tax receivable in the first quarter of 2008. In late 2008, legislation was passed which contained provisions that allowed for the refund of coal excise tax collected on certain coal shipments. In 2009, we received a coal excise tax refund resulting in approximately $35 million, net of income taxes, recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund). Partially offsetting the 2009 excise tax refund were operating losses associated with discontinued operations and assets held for sale ($20.6 million) and a $10.0 million loss on the sale of our Chain Valley Mine in Australia. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Summary Higher average sales prices and volumes across all operating regions, particularly in Australia, contributed to an increase in revenues in 2008 compared to 2007. Segment Adjusted EBITDA rose primarily on the higher pricing mentioned above and favorable results from Trading and Brokerage. Increases in sales prices and volumes were partially offset by higher commodity, material, supply, sales related and labor costs in all operating regions. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $987.9 million in 2008, or $3.60 per diluted share, 123.7% above 2007 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $441.6 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 169.7 161.4 8.3 5.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 30.7 29.6 1.1 3.7 % Australian Mining 23.4 20.4 3.0 14.7 % Trading and Brokerage 31.2 24.1 7.1 29.5 % Total tons sold 255.0 235.5 19.5 8.3 % 42 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,533.1 $ 2,063.2 $ 469.9 22.8 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,154.6 987.1 167.5 17.0 % Australian Mining 2,242.8 1,117.6 1,125.2 100.7 % Trading and Brokerage 601.8 320.7 281.1 87.7 % Other 28.7 35.2 (6.5 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,561.0 $ 4,523.8 $ 2,037.2 45.0 % Total revenues increased in 2008 compared to the prior year across all operating segments. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: An increase in average sales price at our Australian Mining operations (75.0%), primarily driven by the strength of metallurgical coal prices on our Australian contracts that reprice annually in the second quarter of each year. U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (15.2%) driven by the benefit of higher priced coal supply agreements signed in recent years. Australias volumes increased over the prior year (14.7%) from strong demand during the first three quarters of 2008 and additional production from recently completed mines. Year over year increases were partially offset by heavy rainfall and flooding in Queensland during the first quarter of 2008 and customer shipment deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic slowdown. Increased demand also led to higher volumes across our U.S. operating segments, which overcame slightly lower volumes at some of our Midwestern U.S. Mining surface operations due to poor weather in that operating region that impacted production during the first and second quarters. The volume increase of 5.1% at our Western U.S. Mining operations resulted from greater throughput from capital improvements and contributions from our new El Segundo Mine, partially offset by the flooding in the midwestern U.S. that impacted railroad shipping performance related to western U.S. production during the second quarter of 2008. Trading and Brokerage revenues increased over the prior year due to increased trading positions allowing us to capture market movements derived from the volatility of both domestic and international coal markets. Also impacting year over year revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations was an agreement to recover previously recognized postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs of $56.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. 43 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 681.3 $ 595.4 $ 85.9 14.4 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 177.3 200.0 (22.7 ) (11.4 )% Australian Mining 1,016.6 167.2 849.4 508.0 % Trading and Brokerage 218.9 116.6 102.3 87.7 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.1 $ 1,079.2 $ 1,014.9 94.0 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2008 over the prior year primarily driven by an overall increase in average sales prices per ton across the region ($2.10) and higher volumes in the region due to increased demand and greater throughput as a result of capital improvements. Also contributing to the increase was the recovery of postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs discussed above. Partially offsetting the pricing and volume contributions were higher per ton costs ($1.78). The cost increases were primarily due to higher sales related costs, higher material, supply and labor costs, higher repair and maintenance costs in the Powder River Basin and increased commodity costs, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives pricing. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2008 as increases in average sales price per ton ($4.22) were offset by cost increases resulting from higher costs for commodities, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives prices, as well as higher material, supply and labor costs. Heavy rains and flooding in the midwestern U.S. affected sales volume at some of our mines, particularly in the first half of the year. Also affecting the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment was the decrease in revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants in the prior year ($28.9 million) due to the producers exiting the synthetic fuel market after expiration of federal tax credits at the end of 2007. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 primarily due to higher pricing negotiated in the second quarter of 2008 ($41.06 per ton), higher overall volumes as a result of strong export demand and contributions from our recently completed mines and lower demurrage costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher fuel costs, an increase in labor and overburden removal expenses and higher contractor costs (five of ten Australian mines are managed utilizing contract miners). Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 over the prior year due to increased trading volumes and higher coal price volatility. 44 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.1 $ 1,079.2 $ 1,014.9 94.0 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (247.2 ) (109.5 ) (137.7 ) (125.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (402.4 ) (346.3 ) (56.1 ) (16.2 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.2 ) (23.7 ) (24.5 ) (103.4 )% Interest expense (227.0 ) (235.8 ) 8.8 3.7 % Interest income 10.0 7.0 3.0 42.9 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,179.3 $ 370.9 $ 808.4 218.0 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased over the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, and higher asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the following: Higher selling and administrative expenses ($54.7 million) primarily driven by an increase in performance based incentive costs and legal expenses; Cost reimbursement and partner fees received in the prior year for the Prairie State project, primarily related to the entrance of new project partners ($29.5 million); Lower net gains on disposals or exchanges of assets ($15.7 million). 2008 activity included a gain of $54.0 million on the sale of approximately 58 million tons of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. 2007 activity included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of oil and gas rights and assets in more than 860,000 acres in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for coal reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. The prior year also included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands to the Prairie State equity partners; and Lower equity income ($15.5 million) from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela) and higher costs associated with Btu Conversion activities of $14.3 million in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was higher in 2008 compared to the prior year because of increased depletion across our operating platform resulting from the volume increases and the impact of mining higher value coal reserves. In addition, depreciation and depletion increases resulted from our recently completed Australian mines and depletion at our El Segundo Mine. Asset retirement obligation expense increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to an increase in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates that reflect higher fuel, labor and re vegetation costs, as well as an overall increase in the number of acres disturbed. The addition of the El Segundo Mine, which was completed in June 2008, also contributed to higher asset retirement obligation expense. 45 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,179.3 $ 370.9 $ 808.4 218.0 % Income tax (provision) benefit (191.4 ) 70.7 (262.1 ) (370.7 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 987.9 441.6 546.3 123.7 % Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (28.8 ) (180.1 ) 151.3 84.0 % Net income 959.1 261.5 697.6 266.8 % Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (6.2 ) 2.3 (8.5 ) (369.6 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 952.9 $ 263.8 $ 689.1 261.2 % Net income attributable to common stockholders increased in 2008 compared to the prior year due to the increase in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense in 2008 due to higher pre tax earnings ($282.9 million); and Valuation allowance release against federal net operating loss credits recognized into income in 2007 ($197.8 million); partially offset by Income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the weakening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar in 2008 ($121.2 million; exchange rate fell 21% in 2008 compared to an 11% increase in 2007, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.7913 $ (0.1888 ) $ 0.0903 The favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in 2008 ($106.2 million); and The release of a foreign valuation allowance against a portion of our Australian net operating loss carryforwards in 2008 ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a lower loss from discontinued operations as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred for Patriot operations in 2007. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 related to operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine, and an $11.7 million write off of an excise tax refund receivable (net of tax) as a result of an April 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Outlook Near Term Outlook Global economies are showing signs of improvement, with 2010 economic forecasts estimating a 2.6 to 4.0% expansion although slower than expected economic improvement could temper these estimates. The 46 Table of Contents Asia Pacific markets are expected to continue to outpace the U.S. and European markets in economic growth and therefore electricity generation and steel production. For 2009, China and India were the only steel producing majors to outpace prior year levels, with all other nations 23% lower on average. For 2010, the World Steel Association estimates global steel production will increase 9 percent over 2009. Globally, 72 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation are under construction and expected to come on line during 2010, more than 70% of which are new units in China and India. New global coal fueled generation for 2010 is estimated to require approximately 300 million tons of new annual coal demand. In the U.S., higher coal use caused by colder winter weather lowered utility stockpiles an estimated 25 to 30 million tons between December 2009 and mid January 2010. As of February 15, 2010, utility stockpiles were approximately 150 to 155 million tons, 24% above the 10 year average and 6% above the year ago level. We believe U.S. coal demand could rise 60 to 80 million tons based on economic growth, increasing industrial production and an expected reduction of coal to gas switching due to rising natural gas prices. Conversely, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates coal production will be 43 million tons lower in 2010, in part due to production declines initiated in 2009. With rising demand and lower production, utility coal inventories are likely to be reduced. As of January 26, 2010, we are targeting full year 2010 production of approximately 185 to 195 million tons in the U.S. and 26 to 28 million tons in Australia. Total 2010 sales are expected to be in a range of 240 to 260 million tons. We may continue to adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand. We are fully contracted for 2010 at planned production levels in the U.S. As of January 26, 2010 we had 4.5 to 5.5 million tons of Australian metallurgical coal unpriced for 2010, along with 6.5 to 7.0 million tons of unpriced export thermal coal. Unpriced 2010 volumes are primarily planned for deliveries over the last three quarters of 2010. We continue to manage costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. To mitigate the external cost pressures, we have an ongoing company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of below optimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. We rely on ongoing access to the worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly, many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. Coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for each of the past six years, with consumption growing nearly twice as fast as total energy use. The International Energy Agencys (IEA) World Energy Outlook estimates world primary energy demand will grow 40% between 2007 and 2030, with demand for coal rising 53%. China and India alone account for more than half of the expected incremental energy demand. Coal is expected to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide, with its share of the power generation mix projected to rise to 44% in 2030. Currently, 217 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity 47 Table of Contents generating plants are under construction around the world, representing more than 800 million tons of annual coal demand expected to come online in the next several years. In the U.S., 16 gigawatts of new coal based generating capacity have been completed in 2009 or are under construction, representing approximately 65 million tons of annual coal demand when they come online over the next three to five years as expected. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as CTG and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel such as CTL, which is estimated to add nearly 70 million tons of annual U.S. coal demand by 2035. In addition, China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. The IEA projects natural gas demand will grow 1.5% per year to just under 4,310 billion cubic meters in 2030. The biggest increase in absolute terms occurs in the Middle East, which holds the majority of the worlds proven reserves, and non OECD Asia. North America and Eastern Europe/Eurasia are expected to remain the leading gas consumers in 2030, even though their demand is expected to rise less in percentage terms than almost anywhere else globally. Globally, the share of renewables is projected to rise four percentage points to 22% between 2007 and 2030, with most of the growth coming from non hydro sources. Nuclear power is expected to grow in all major regions with the exception of Europe, but its share in total generation is expected to fall between 2007 and 2030. We continue to support clean coal technology development and other initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation in a number of projects in the U.S., China and Australia. In addition, clean coal technology development in the U.S. is being accelerated by funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and by the formation of an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the commercial development of clean coal technologies. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations forces electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable (through our securitization program). Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, federal coal lease payments, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of our 5.875% and 6.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures. We generally fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. We believe our available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will be sufficient in the near term. As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $988.8 million and $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. 48 Table of Contents The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Protection Act), which was effective January 1, 2008, increased the long term funding targets for single employer pension plans from 90% to 100%. At risk plans, as defined by the Pension Protection Act, are restricted from making full lump sum payments and from increasing benefits unless they are funded immediately, and also requires that the plan give participants notice regarding the at risk status of the plan. If a plan falls below 60%, lump sum payments are prohibited and participant benefit accruals cease. As of December 31, 2009, our pension plans were approximately 77% funded, before considering planned 2010 contributions. Our minimum funding requirement for 2010 is approximately $3 million, and the qualified plans would not be considered at risk. Using current assumptions, our 2011 minimum funding requirement would be approximately $98 million. We also have a share repurchase program that has an available capacity of $700.4 million at December 31, 2009. While no repurchases were made in 2009 under the program, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2009 decreased $356.3 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the decline in operating cash flows generated from our Australian mining operations on lower volumes and lower average pricing and the timing of cash flows from our working capital, primarily driven by foreign income tax payments related to prior year earnings. The decrease in cash used in discontinued operations of $117.4 million was primarily due to approximately $59 million of cash received related to coal excise tax refunds in 2009 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund) and lower current year payments related to Patriot discontinued operations. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased $11.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower federal coal lease expenditures of $54.9 million in 2009, partially offset by higher spending for our share of the Prairie State construction costs and additional investments in equity affiliates and joint venture projects in the prior year. Capital expenditures in 2009 were consistent with prior year as current year spending related to the development of our Bear Run Mine was offset by prior year spending related to the completion of our El Segundo Mine and expenditures for our blending and loadout facility at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine in the Western U.S. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $384.7 million, primarily due to 2008 payments related to the repurchase of common stock ($199.8 million), the acquisition of noncontrolling interests relating to our Millennium Mine ($110.1 million) and payments on our revolving line of credit ($97.7 million). During 2009, we purchased $10.0 million face value of our 6.84% Series A bonds and $10.0 million face value of our 6.84% Series C bonds for a combined total of $19.0 million. 49 Table of Contents Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted of the following: December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 490.3 $ 490.3 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 2066 371.5 369.9 7.375% Senior Notes due November 2016 650.0 650.0 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013 650.0 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026 247.1 247.0 5.875% Senior Notes due March 2016 218.1 218.1 6.84% Series C Bonds due December 2016 33.0 43.0 6.34% Series B Bonds due December 2014 15.0 18.0 6.84% Series A Bonds due December 2014 10.0 Capital lease obligations 67.5 81.2 Fair value hedge adjustment 8.4 15.1 Other 1.4 1.0 Total $ 2,752.3 $ 2,793.6 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2009. Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2009, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility was LIBOR plus 0.75%, or a total of 1.0%. We must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings and $315.7 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Other Long Term Debt. A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Third party Security Ratings. The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on the Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of 50 Table of Contents creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement. On August 7, 2009, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2010 are anticipated to be between $600 million to $650 million. The planned expenditures include sustaining capital at our existing mines, completion of our Bear Run Mine in western Indiana, expansion of our metallurgical and thermal coal export platform in Australia to serve the growth markets in Asia and funding of our Prairie State investment. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due By Year Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,219.5 $ 203.4 $ 884.8 $ 964.8 $ 3,166.5 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 80.3 15.1 30.2 35.0 Operating lease obligations 468.1 96.4 153.6 100.3 117.8 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 70.4 70.4 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 79.9 11.3 16.8 15.0 36.8 Take or pay obligations(2) 1,864.4 110.7 297.4 310.4 1,145.9 Other long term liabilities(3) 1,485.5 151.0 300.3 292.6 741.6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 9,268.1 $ 658.3 $ 1,683.1 $ 1,718.1 $ 5,208.6 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. (2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal, some of which extend to 2040, including amounts relating to export facilities currently under construction which are expected to be completed in 2010. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2009, we had $70.4 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $0.9 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next five years. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures primarily relate to the replacement and improvement of equipment and facilities at existing mines. We do not expect any of the $113.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. 51 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (such as self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2009: Workers Reclamation Lease Compensation Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self bonding $ 821.9 $ $ $ $ 821.9 Surety bonds 772.3 116.3 8.7 57.3 954.6 Letters of credit 34.9 43.0 237.8 315.7 $ 1,629.1 $ 116.3 $ 51.7 $ 295.1 $ 2,092.2 (1) Other includes the six letter of credit obligations described below and an additional $61.1 million in letters of credit and surety bonds related to collateral for surety companies, road maintenance, performance guarantees and other operations. We own a 37.5% interest in Dominion Terminal Associates, a partnership that operates a coal export terminal in Newport News, Virginia under a 30 year lease that permits the partnership to purchase the terminal at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount. The partners have severally (but not jointly) agreed to make payments under various agreements which in the aggregate provide the partnership with sufficient funds to pay rents and to cover the principal and interest payments on the floating rate industrial revenue bonds issued by the Peninsula Ports Authority, and which are supported by letters of credit from a commercial bank. As of December 31, 2009, our maximum reimbursement obligation to the commercial bank was in turn supported by four letters of credit totaling $42.7 million. We are party to an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make special contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.) and continues under this process as of December 31, 2009. As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. At December 31, 2009, we have a $154.3 million letter of credit for collateral for bank guarantees issued with respect to certain reclamation and performance obligations related to some of our Australian mines. Other Guarantees. See the Other Guarantees section of Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other guarantees. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Under our accounts receivable securitization program in place at December 31, 2009, a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary were sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit 52 Table of Contents (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The securitization program was renewed in May 2009 and amended in December 2009, and extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with receivables sold to the Conduit removed from our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of interest in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $254.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and $275.0 million as of December 31, 2008 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounts receivable securitization program). On January 25, 2010, the receivables purchase agreement for the accounts receivable securitization program was amended and restated to add a second multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit as a purchaser. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $76.8 million, while funding payments were $110.3 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 6.7 $ (5.7 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 98.3 $ (84.6 ) 53 Table of Contents Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.6 $ (0.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (46.1 ) $ 52.2 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 10.92 years at December 31, 2009. Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $40.1 million, and payments totaled $12.4 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ. Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three hierarchy Levels 1, 2 and 3 (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis 54 Table of Contents adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. At December 31, 2009, 5% of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. At December 31, 2008, the percentage of Level 3 net financial assets compared to the total net financial liabilities is not meaningful due to the overall liability position at December 31, 2008. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, emission allowances, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter, direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities to support our coal trading related activities (coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. We perform a VaR analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter and brokerage coal trading. The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical 55 Table of Contents chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not capture the loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR. The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the actual low, high, and average VaR for our coal trading portfolio were $2.7 million, $15.9 million, and $8.7 million, respectively. Our VaR decreased over the prior year due to less price volatility and lower overall prices in the U.S. and international coal markets. As of December 31, 2009, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage of Expiration Portfolio Total 2010 46 % 2011 51 % 2012 3 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Nonperformance and Credit Risk The fair value of our assets and liabilities reflect adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our concentration of nonperformance and credit risk is substantially with electric utilities, steel producers, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions. We conduct our various hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, and fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks. In light of the recent turmoil in the financial markets, we continue to closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.05 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $82 million for 2010. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $17 million for 2010. The chart at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2009. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.4 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $0.4 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $4.2 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $130 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 93% and 90% of our worldwide sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2009 and 2008, respectively. We are fully contracted for 2010 at planned production levels in the U.S. We had 11 to 12.5 million tons remaining to be priced for 2010 in Australia at January 26, 2010. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of fixed price contracts, cost plus contracts and a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, which are primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 130 to 135 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2010. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $31 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $14 million. Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 345,000 to 355,000 tons of explosives during 2010 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $6 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $3 million. 57 Table of Contents Notional Amounts and Fair Value.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as reflected at the end of Item 6. Selected Financial Data. and in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations those operations recently divested, as well as certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets. In October 2006, we acquired Excel. Our results of operations include Excels results of operations from the date of acquisition. We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005 from our audited financial statements. You should read the following table in conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the worlds largest private sector coal company, with majority interests in 28 coal mining operations in the U.S. and Australia. In 2009, we produced 210.0 million tons of coal and sold 243.6 million tons of coal. For 2009, our U.S. sales represented 19% of U.S. coal consumption and were approximately 50% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining Segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. In 2009, metallurgical coal was approximately 3% of our total sales volume, but represented a larger share of our revenue, approximately 23%. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2009, approximately 93% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, 81% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 17% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations. Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, as well as the management of our vast coal reserve and real estate holdings. We continue to pursue development of coal fueled generating and Btu Conversion projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. Coal fueled generating projects may involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. Currently, we own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. We are determining how to best participate in Btu Conversion technologies to economically convert our coal resources to natural gas and transportation fuels through the Kentucky NewGas and GreatPoint Energy projects in the U.S. We are also advancing the development of clean coal technologies, including carbon 37 Table of Contents capture and sequestration, through a number of initiatives that include the FutureGen Alliance and university research programs in the U.S., GreenGen in China and COAL21 Fund in Australia. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by the rate of the economic recovery, adverse weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Summary Our overall results for 2009 compared to 2008 reflect the unfavorable impact of lower global demand for coal as a result of the global economic recession. Despite the recession, our 2009 Adjusted EBITDA was the second highest in our 126 year history and second only to our 2008 Adjusted EBITDA. We also ended 2009 with total available liquidity of $2.5 billion. We continue to focus on strong cost control and productivity improvements, increased contributions from our high margin operations and exercising tight capital discipline. Our 2009 tons sold were below prior year levels reflecting planned production reductions in the Powder River Basin to match lower demand, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the full year operation of our El Segundo Mine in the Southwest. In the U.S., the decreased demand from lower industrial output, lower natural gas prices that resulted in higher fuel switching, and higher coal stockpiles in the U.S. led to an 8.5 million ton decline in sales volume. In Australia, lower demand from steel customers resulted in a 1.3 million ton decline in metallurgical coal volume, although volumes in the second half of 2009 began to increase on an improved economic outlook led by demand from Asian Pacific markets. Our 2009 revenues declined compared to 2008 and were primarily impacted by Australias lower annual export contract pricing that commenced on April 1, 2009 as compared to 2008s record pricing and the overall decline in volume. Lower revenues were also driven by the decline in Trading and Brokerage revenues that resulted from lower coal pricing volatility. The lower Australian and Trading and Brokerage revenues were partially offset by an increase in U.S. revenues per ton that reflect multi year contracts signed at higher prices in recent years. While our Segment Adjusted EBITDA reflects the lower revenue discussed above, our 2009 margins also reflect the impact of producing at reduced levels as well as higher sales related costs. In addition, our costs in Australia were higher due to two additional longwall moves compared to 2008 and the impact of mining in difficult geologic conditions that also included higher costs for overburden removal. Net income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the above items, as well as lower results from equity affiliates and decreased net gains on disposals of assets. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $457.9 million in 2009, or $1.64 per diluted share, 53.6% below 2008 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $987.9 million, or $3.60 per diluted share. 38 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 160.1 169.7 (9.6 ) (5.7 )% Midwestern U.S. Mining 31.8 30.7 1.1 3.6 % Australian Mining 22.3 23.4 (1.1 ) (4.7 )% Trading and Brokerage 29.4 31.2 (1.8 ) (5.8 )% Total tons sold 243.6 255.0 (11.4 ) (4.5 )% Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,612.6 $ 2,533.1 $ 79.5 3.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,303.8 1,154.6 149.2 12.9 % Australian Mining 1,678.0 2,242.8 (564.8 ) (25.2 )% Trading and Brokerage 391.0 601.8 (210.8 ) (35.0 )% Other 27.0 28.7 (1.7 ) (5.9 )% Total revenues $ 6,012.4 $ 6,561.0 $ (548.6 ) (8.4 )% 2009 revenues were below prior year driven by decreases in our Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage segments as discussed below: Australian Mining operations average sales price decreased 21.4% from the prior year reflecting the lower annual export contract pricing that commenced April 1, 2009 compared to the record pricing realized in 2008. The price decreases were combined with volume decreases from the prior year (4.7%) due to overall lower demand experienced in the first half of 2009. 2009 metallurgical coal shipments of 6.9 million tons were 1.3 million tons below prior year. In the second half of 2009, 5.0 million tons of metallurgical coal were shipped, reflecting a partial recovery from the lower metallurgical coal shipments that occurred in the first half of the year. Trading and Brokerage revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower coal pricing volatility in 2009 resulting in lower margins on trading transactions, partially offset by profit from business contracted in 2008 that was realized in 2009 on an international brokerage arrangement. These decreases to revenues were partially offset by revenue increases in our Midwestern U.S. and Western U.S. Mining segments as discussed below: Midwestern U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.3%) driven by the benefit of higher Illinois Basin prices and increased shipments, including purchased coal used to satisfy certain coal supply agreements. Western U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.2%) due to a combination of higher contract pricing and a shift in sales mix. Revenues were also higher due to increased shipments from our El Segundo Mine (commissioned in June 2008) and customer contract termination and restructuring agreements. These increases were partially offset by the prior year 39 Table of Contents revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million) and an overall volume decrease (5.7%) reflecting our planned Powder River Basin production decreases to match demand. Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 721.5 $ 681.3 $ 40.2 5.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 281.9 177.3 104.6 59.0 % Australian Mining 437.8 1,016.6 (578.8 ) (56.9 )% Trading and Brokerage 193.4 218.9 (25.5 ) (11.6 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year due to lower annual export contract pricing and lower sales volume due to reduced demand ($416.0 million) as discussed above. Also impacting the segments Adjusted EBITDA was higher production costs ($170.7 million) driven by increased overburden stripping ratios and decreased longwall mine performance, which included higher costs associated with two additional longwall moves in 2009 compared to 2008. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to prior year primarily due to lower net revenue discussed above. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher pricing ($205.5 million), partially offset by lower demand ($63.2 million), a prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million), higher sales related costs ($52.0 million) and lower productivity due to increased stripping ratios ($20.8 million). The impact of lower demand was partially mitigated by revenues from customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million). Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year primarily due to higher pricing ($110.7 million) and decreased commodity costs ($16.0 million), partially offset by higher costs associated with mining in more difficult geological conditions compared to the prior year ($20.7 million). Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (344.5 ) (247.2 ) (97.3 ) (39.4 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (405.2 ) (402.4 ) (2.8 ) (0.7 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (40.1 ) (48.2 ) 8.1 16.8 % Interest expense (201.2 ) (227.0 ) 25.8 11.4 % Interest income 8.1 10.0 (1.9 ) (19.0 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% 40 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from prior year primarily due to the lower Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above and lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense and asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease of $97.3 million in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the following: Lower results from equity affiliates ($69.1 million) primarily from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela). Carbones del Guasare incurred unfavorable results in 2009 compared to 2008 (our share of which was $25.6 million) due to lower productivity, higher operating costs and ongoing labor issues; in addition, we recognized a $34.7 million impairment loss on this investment. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning this joint venture interest. Lower net gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($49.7 million) was due primarily to a $54.0 million gain in the prior year from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. The above decreases to Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA were offset by lower costs associated with Btu Conversion activities ($16.9 million). Interest expense was lower than prior year due to lower variable interest rates on our Term Loan Facility and accounts receivable securitization program and lower average borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates reflecting lower fuel and re vegetation costs incurred in our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% Income tax provision (193.8 ) (191.4 ) (2.4 ) (1.3 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 457.9 987.9 (530.0 ) (53.6 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5.1 (28.8 ) 33.9 117.7 % Net income 463.0 959.1 (496.1 ) (51.7 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14.8 ) (6.2 ) (8.6 ) (138.7 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 448.2 $ 952.9 $ (504.7 ) (53.0 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. 41 Table of Contents Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the strengthening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar ($139.6 million; exchange rate rose 29% in 2009 compared to a 21% decrease in 2008, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.2041 $ (0.1888 ) The prior year release of a foreign valuation allowance related to our Australian net operating loss carry forwards ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. The above increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower pre tax earnings in 2009, which drove a decrease to the income tax provision ($184.6 million). Income from discontinued operations increased compared to the prior year as the prior year included operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine, and an $11.7 million write off of a coal excise tax receivable in the first quarter of 2008. In late 2008, legislation was passed which contained provisions that allowed for the refund of coal excise tax collected on certain coal shipments. In 2009, we received a coal excise tax refund resulting in approximately $35 million, net of income taxes, recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund). Partially offsetting the 2009 excise tax refund were operating losses associated with discontinued operations and assets held for sale ($20.6 million) and a $10.0 million loss on the sale of our Chain Valley Mine in Australia. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Summary Higher average sales prices and volumes across all operating regions, particularly in Australia, contributed to an increase in revenues in 2008 compared to 2007. Segment Adjusted EBITDA rose primarily on the higher pricing mentioned above and favorable results from Trading and Brokerage. Increases in sales prices and volumes were partially offset by higher commodity, material, supply, sales related and labor costs in all operating regions. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $987.9 million in 2008, or $3.60 per diluted share, 123.7% above 2007 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $441.6 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 169.7 161.4 8.3 5.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 30.7 29.6 1.1 3.7 % Australian Mining 23.4 20.4 3.0 14.7 % Trading and Brokerage 31.2 24.1 7.1 29.5 % Total tons sold 255.0 235.5 19.5 8.3 % 42 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,533.1 $ 2,063.2 $ 469.9 22.8 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,154.6 987.1 167.5 17.0 % Australian Mining 2,242.8 1,117.6 1,125.2 100.7 % Trading and Brokerage 601.8 320.7 281.1 87.7 % Other 28.7 35.2 (6.5 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,561.0 $ 4,523.8 $ 2,037.2 45.0 % Total revenues increased in 2008 compared to the prior year across all operating segments. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: An increase in average sales price at our Australian Mining operations (75.0%), primarily driven by the strength of metallurgical coal prices on our Australian contracts that reprice annually in the second quarter of each year. U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (15.2%) driven by the benefit of higher priced coal supply agreements signed in recent years. Australias volumes increased over the prior year (14.7%) from strong demand during the first three quarters of 2008 and additional production from recently completed mines. Year over year increases were partially offset by heavy rainfall and flooding in Queensland during the first quarter of 2008 and customer shipment deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic slowdown. Increased demand also led to higher volumes across our U.S. operating segments, which overcame slightly lower volumes at some of our Midwestern U.S. Mining surface operations due to poor weather in that operating region that impacted production during the first and second quarters. The volume increase of 5.1% at our Western U.S. Mining operations resulted from greater throughput from capital improvements and contributions from our new El Segundo Mine, partially offset by the flooding in the midwestern U.S. that impacted railroad shipping performance related to western U.S. production during the second quarter of 2008. Trading and Brokerage revenues increased over the prior year due to increased trading positions allowing us to capture market movements derived from the volatility of both domestic and international coal markets. Also impacting year over year revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations was an agreement to recover previously recognized postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs of $56.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. 43 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 681.3 $ 595.4 $ 85.9 14.4 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 177.3 200.0 (22.7 ) (11.4 )% Australian Mining 1,016.6 167.2 849.4 508.0 % Trading and Brokerage 218.9 116.6 102.3 87.7 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.1 $ 1,079.2 $ 1,014.9 94.0 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2008 over the prior year primarily driven by an overall increase in average sales prices per ton across the region ($2.10) and higher volumes in the region due to increased demand and greater throughput as a result of capital improvements. Also contributing to the increase was the recovery of postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs discussed above. Partially offsetting the pricing and volume contributions were higher per ton costs ($1.78). The cost increases were primarily due to higher sales related costs, higher material, supply and labor costs, higher repair and maintenance costs in the Powder River Basin and increased commodity costs, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives pricing. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2008 as increases in average sales price per ton ($4.22) were offset by cost increases resulting from higher costs for commodities, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives prices, as well as higher material, supply and labor costs. Heavy rains and flooding in the midwestern U.S. affected sales volume at some of our mines, particularly in the first half of the year. Also affecting the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment was the decrease in revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants in the prior year ($28.9 million) due to the producers exiting the synthetic fuel market after expiration of federal tax credits at the end of 2007. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 primarily due to higher pricing negotiated in the second quarter of 2008 ($41.06 per ton), higher overall volumes as a result of strong export demand and contributions from our recently completed mines and lower demurrage costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher fuel costs, an increase in labor and overburden removal expenses and higher contractor costs (five of ten Australian mines are managed utilizing contract miners). Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 over the prior year due to increased trading volumes and higher coal price volatility. 44 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.1 $ 1,079.2 $ 1,014.9 94.0 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (247.2 ) (109.5 ) (137.7 ) (125.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (402.4 ) (346.3 ) (56.1 ) (16.2 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.2 ) (23.7 ) (24.5 ) (103.4 )% Interest expense (227.0 ) (235.8 ) 8.8 3.7 % Interest income 10.0 7.0 3.0 42.9 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,179.3 $ 370.9 $ 808.4 218.0 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased over the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, and higher asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the following: Higher selling and administrative expenses ($54.7 million) primarily driven by an increase in performance based incentive costs and legal expenses; Cost reimbursement and partner fees received in the prior year for the Prairie State project, primarily related to the entrance of new project partners ($29.5 million); Lower net gains on disposals or exchanges of assets ($15.7 million). 2008 activity included a gain of $54.0 million on the sale of approximately 58 million tons of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. 2007 activity included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of oil and gas rights and assets in more than 860,000 acres in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for coal reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. The prior year also included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands to the Prairie State equity partners; and Lower equity income ($15.5 million) from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela) and higher costs associated with Btu Conversion activities of $14.3 million in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was higher in 2008 compared to the prior year because of increased depletion across our operating platform resulting from the volume increases and the impact of mining higher value coal reserves. In addition, depreciation and depletion increases resulted from our recently completed Australian mines and depletion at our El Segundo Mine. Asset retirement obligation expense increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to an increase in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates that reflect higher fuel, labor and re vegetation costs, as well as an overall increase in the number of acres disturbed. The addition of the El Segundo Mine, which was completed in June 2008, also contributed to higher asset retirement obligation expense. 45 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,179.3 $ 370.9 $ 808.4 218.0 % Income tax (provision) benefit (191.4 ) 70.7 (262.1 ) (370.7 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 987.9 441.6 546.3 123.7 % Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (28.8 ) (180.1 ) 151.3 84.0 % Net income 959.1 261.5 697.6 266.8 % Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (6.2 ) 2.3 (8.5 ) (369.6 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 952.9 $ 263.8 $ 689.1 261.2 % Net income attributable to common stockholders increased in 2008 compared to the prior year due to the increase in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense in 2008 due to higher pre tax earnings ($282.9 million); and Valuation allowance release against federal net operating loss credits recognized into income in 2007 ($197.8 million); partially offset by Income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the weakening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar in 2008 ($121.2 million; exchange rate fell 21% in 2008 compared to an 11% increase in 2007, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.7913 $ (0.1888 ) $ 0.0903 The favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in 2008 ($106.2 million); and The release of a foreign valuation allowance against a portion of our Australian net operating loss carryforwards in 2008 ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a lower loss from discontinued operations as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred for Patriot operations in 2007. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 related to operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine, and an $11.7 million write off of an excise tax refund receivable (net of tax) as a result of an April 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Outlook Near Term Outlook Global economies are showing signs of improvement, with 2010 economic forecasts estimating a 2.6 to 4.0% expansion although slower than expected economic improvement could temper these estimates. The 46 Table of Contents Asia Pacific markets are expected to continue to outpace the U.S. and European markets in economic growth and therefore electricity generation and steel production. For 2009, China and India were the only steel producing majors to outpace prior year levels, with all other nations 23% lower on average. For 2010, the World Steel Association estimates global steel production will increase 9 percent over 2009. Globally, 72 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation are under construction and expected to come on line during 2010, more than 70% of which are new units in China and India. New global coal fueled generation for 2010 is estimated to require approximately 300 million tons of new annual coal demand. In the U.S., higher coal use caused by colder winter weather lowered utility stockpiles an estimated 25 to 30 million tons between December 2009 and mid January 2010. As of February 15, 2010, utility stockpiles were approximately 150 to 155 million tons, 24% above the 10 year average and 6% above the year ago level. We believe U.S. coal demand could rise 60 to 80 million tons based on economic growth, increasing industrial production and an expected reduction of coal to gas switching due to rising natural gas prices. Conversely, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates coal production will be 43 million tons lower in 2010, in part due to production declines initiated in 2009. With rising demand and lower production, utility coal inventories are likely to be reduced. As of January 26, 2010, we are targeting full year 2010 production of approximately 185 to 195 million tons in the U.S. and 26 to 28 million tons in Australia. Total 2010 sales are expected to be in a range of 240 to 260 million tons. We may continue to adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand. We are fully contracted for 2010 at planned production levels in the U.S. As of January 26, 2010 we had 4.5 to 5.5 million tons of Australian metallurgical coal unpriced for 2010, along with 6.5 to 7.0 million tons of unpriced export thermal coal. Unpriced 2010 volumes are primarily planned for deliveries over the last three quarters of 2010. We continue to manage costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. To mitigate the external cost pressures, we have an ongoing company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of below optimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. We rely on ongoing access to the worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly, many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. Coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for each of the past six years, with consumption growing nearly twice as fast as total energy use. The International Energy Agencys (IEA) World Energy Outlook estimates world primary energy demand will grow 40% between 2007 and 2030, with demand for coal rising 53%. China and India alone account for more than half of the expected incremental energy demand. Coal is expected to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide, with its share of the power generation mix projected to rise to 44% in 2030. Currently, 217 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity 47 Table of Contents generating plants are under construction around the world, representing more than 800 million tons of annual coal demand expected to come online in the next several years. In the U.S., 16 gigawatts of new coal based generating capacity have been completed in 2009 or are under construction, representing approximately 65 million tons of annual coal demand when they come online over the next three to five years as expected. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as CTG and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel such as CTL, which is estimated to add nearly 70 million tons of annual U.S. coal demand by 2035. In addition, China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. The IEA projects natural gas demand will grow 1.5% per year to just under 4,310 billion cubic meters in 2030. The biggest increase in absolute terms occurs in the Middle East, which holds the majority of the worlds proven reserves, and non OECD Asia. North America and Eastern Europe/Eurasia are expected to remain the leading gas consumers in 2030, even though their demand is expected to rise less in percentage terms than almost anywhere else globally. Globally, the share of renewables is projected to rise four percentage points to 22% between 2007 and 2030, with most of the growth coming from non hydro sources. Nuclear power is expected to grow in all major regions with the exception of Europe, but its share in total generation is expected to fall between 2007 and 2030. We continue to support clean coal technology development and other initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation in a number of projects in the U.S., China and Australia. In addition, clean coal technology development in the U.S. is being accelerated by funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and by the formation of an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the commercial development of clean coal technologies. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations forces electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable (through our securitization program). Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, federal coal lease payments, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of our 5.875% and 6.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures. We generally fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. We believe our available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will be sufficient in the near term. As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $988.8 million and $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. 48 Table of Contents The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Protection Act), which was effective January 1, 2008, increased the long term funding targets for single employer pension plans from 90% to 100%. At risk plans, as defined by the Pension Protection Act, are restricted from making full lump sum payments and from increasing benefits unless they are funded immediately, and also requires that the plan give participants notice regarding the at risk status of the plan. If a plan falls below 60%, lump sum payments are prohibited and participant benefit accruals cease. As of December 31, 2009, our pension plans were approximately 77% funded, before considering planned 2010 contributions. Our minimum funding requirement for 2010 is approximately $3 million, and the qualified plans would not be considered at risk. Using current assumptions, our 2011 minimum funding requirement would be approximately $98 million. We also have a share repurchase program that has an available capacity of $700.4 million at December 31, 2009. While no repurchases were made in 2009 under the program, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2009 decreased $356.3 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the decline in operating cash flows generated from our Australian mining operations on lower volumes and lower average pricing and the timing of cash flows from our working capital, primarily driven by foreign income tax payments related to prior year earnings. The decrease in cash used in discontinued operations of $117.4 million was primarily due to approximately $59 million of cash received related to coal excise tax refunds in 2009 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund) and lower current year payments related to Patriot discontinued operations. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased $11.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower federal coal lease expenditures of $54.9 million in 2009, partially offset by higher spending for our share of the Prairie State construction costs and additional investments in equity affiliates and joint venture projects in the prior year. Capital expenditures in 2009 were consistent with prior year as current year spending related to the development of our Bear Run Mine was offset by prior year spending related to the completion of our El Segundo Mine and expenditures for our blending and loadout facility at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine in the Western U.S. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $384.7 million, primarily due to 2008 payments related to the repurchase of common stock ($199.8 million), the acquisition of noncontrolling interests relating to our Millennium Mine ($110.1 million) and payments on our revolving line of credit ($97.7 million). During 2009, we purchased $10.0 million face value of our 6.84% Series A bonds and $10.0 million face value of our 6.84% Series C bonds for a combined total of $19.0 million. 49 Table of Contents Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted of the following: December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 490.3 $ 490.3 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 2066 371.5 369.9 7.375% Senior Notes due November 2016 650.0 650.0 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013 650.0 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026 247.1 247.0 5.875% Senior Notes due March 2016 218.1 218.1 6.84% Series C Bonds due December 2016 33.0 43.0 6.34% Series B Bonds due December 2014 15.0 18.0 6.84% Series A Bonds due December 2014 10.0 Capital lease obligations 67.5 81.2 Fair value hedge adjustment 8.4 15.1 Other 1.4 1.0 Total $ 2,752.3 $ 2,793.6 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2009. Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2009, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility was LIBOR plus 0.75%, or a total of 1.0%. We must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings and $315.7 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Other Long Term Debt. A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Third party Security Ratings. The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on the Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of 50 Table of Contents creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement. On August 7, 2009, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2010 are anticipated to be between $600 million to $650 million. The planned expenditures include sustaining capital at our existing mines, completion of our Bear Run Mine in western Indiana, expansion of our metallurgical and thermal coal export platform in Australia to serve the growth markets in Asia and funding of our Prairie State investment. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due By Year Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,219.5 $ 203.4 $ 884.8 $ 964.8 $ 3,166.5 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 80.3 15.1 30.2 35.0 Operating lease obligations 468.1 96.4 153.6 100.3 117.8 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 70.4 70.4 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 79.9 11.3 16.8 15.0 36.8 Take or pay obligations(2) 1,864.4 110.7 297.4 310.4 1,145.9 Other long term liabilities(3) 1,485.5 151.0 300.3 292.6 741.6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 9,268.1 $ 658.3 $ 1,683.1 $ 1,718.1 $ 5,208.6 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. (2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal, some of which extend to 2040, including amounts relating to export facilities currently under construction which are expected to be completed in 2010. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2009, we had $70.4 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $0.9 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next five years. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures primarily relate to the replacement and improvement of equipment and facilities at existing mines. We do not expect any of the $113.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. 51 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (such as self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2009: Workers Reclamation Lease Compensation Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self bonding $ 821.9 $ $ $ $ 821.9 Surety bonds 772.3 116.3 8.7 57.3 954.6 Letters of credit 34.9 43.0 237.8 315.7 $ 1,629.1 $ 116.3 $ 51.7 $ 295.1 $ 2,092.2 (1) Other includes the six letter of credit obligations described below and an additional $61.1 million in letters of credit and surety bonds related to collateral for surety companies, road maintenance, performance guarantees and other operations. We own a 37.5% interest in Dominion Terminal Associates, a partnership that operates a coal export terminal in Newport News, Virginia under a 30 year lease that permits the partnership to purchase the terminal at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount. The partners have severally (but not jointly) agreed to make payments under various agreements which in the aggregate provide the partnership with sufficient funds to pay rents and to cover the principal and interest payments on the floating rate industrial revenue bonds issued by the Peninsula Ports Authority, and which are supported by letters of credit from a commercial bank. As of December 31, 2009, our maximum reimbursement obligation to the commercial bank was in turn supported by four letters of credit totaling $42.7 million. We are party to an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make special contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.) and continues under this process as of December 31, 2009. As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. At December 31, 2009, we have a $154.3 million letter of credit for collateral for bank guarantees issued with respect to certain reclamation and performance obligations related to some of our Australian mines. Other Guarantees. See the Other Guarantees section of Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other guarantees. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Under our accounts receivable securitization program in place at December 31, 2009, a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary were sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit 52 Table of Contents (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The securitization program was renewed in May 2009 and amended in December 2009, and extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with receivables sold to the Conduit removed from our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of interest in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $254.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and $275.0 million as of December 31, 2008 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounts receivable securitization program). On January 25, 2010, the receivables purchase agreement for the accounts receivable securitization program was amended and restated to add a second multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit as a purchaser. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $76.8 million, while funding payments were $110.3 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 6.7 $ (5.7 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 98.3 $ (84.6 ) 53 Table of Contents Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.6 $ (0.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (46.1 ) $ 52.2 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 10.92 years at December 31, 2009. Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $40.1 million, and payments totaled $12.4 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ. Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three hierarchy Levels 1, 2 and 3 (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis 54 Table of Contents adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. At December 31, 2009, 5% of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. At December 31, 2008, the percentage of Level 3 net financial assets compared to the total net financial liabilities is not meaningful due to the overall liability position at December 31, 2008. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, emission allowances, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter, direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities to support our coal trading related activities (coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. We perform a VaR analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter and brokerage coal trading. The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical 55 Table of Contents chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not capture the loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR. The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the actual low, high, and average VaR for our coal trading portfolio were $2.7 million, $15.9 million, and $8.7 million, respectively. Our VaR decreased over the prior year due to less price volatility and lower overall prices in the U.S. and international coal markets. As of December 31, 2009, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage of Expiration Portfolio Total 2010 46 % 2011 51 % 2012 3 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Nonperformance and Credit Risk The fair value of our assets and liabilities reflect adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our concentration of nonperformance and credit risk is substantially with electric utilities, steel producers, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions. We conduct our various hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, and fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks. In light of the recent turmoil in the financial markets, we continue to closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.05 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $82 million for 2010. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $17 million for 2010. The chart at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2009. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.4 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $0.4 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $4.2 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $130 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 93% and 90% of our worldwide sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2009 and 2008, respectively. We are fully contracted for 2010 at planned production levels in the U.S. We had 11 to 12.5 million tons remaining to be priced for 2010 in Australia at January 26, 2010. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of fixed price contracts, cost plus contracts and a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, which are primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 130 to 135 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2010. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $31 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $14 million. Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 345,000 to 355,000 tons of explosives during 2010 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $6 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $3 million. 57 Table of Contents Notional Amounts and Fair Value.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the worlds largest private sector coal company, with majority interests in 28 coal mining operations in the U.S. and Australia. In 2009, we produced 210.0 million tons of coal and sold 243.6 million tons of coal. For 2009, our U.S. sales represented 19% of U.S. coal consumption and were approximately 50% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining Segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. In 2009, metallurgical coal was approximately 3% of our total sales volume, but represented a larger share of our revenue, approximately 23%. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2009, approximately 93% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, 81% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 17% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations. Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, as well as the management of our vast coal reserve and real estate holdings. We continue to pursue development of coal fueled generating and Btu Conversion projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. Coal fueled generating projects may involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. Currently, we own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. We are determining how to best participate in Btu Conversion technologies to economically convert our coal resources to natural gas and transportation fuels through the Kentucky NewGas and GreatPoint Energy projects in the U.S. We are also advancing the development of clean coal technologies, including carbon 37 Table of Contents capture and sequestration, through a number of initiatives that include the FutureGen Alliance and university research programs in the U.S., GreenGen in China and COAL21 Fund in Australia. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by the rate of the economic recovery, adverse weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Summary Our overall results for 2009 compared to 2008 reflect the unfavorable impact of lower global demand for coal as a result of the global economic recession. Despite the recession, our 2009 Adjusted EBITDA was the second highest in our 126 year history and second only to our 2008 Adjusted EBITDA. We also ended 2009 with total available liquidity of $2.5 billion. We continue to focus on strong cost control and productivity improvements, increased contributions from our high margin operations and exercising tight capital discipline. Our 2009 tons sold were below prior year levels reflecting planned production reductions in the Powder River Basin to match lower demand, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the full year operation of our El Segundo Mine in the Southwest. In the U.S., the decreased demand from lower industrial output, lower natural gas prices that resulted in higher fuel switching, and higher coal stockpiles in the U.S. led to an 8.5 million ton decline in sales volume. In Australia, lower demand from steel customers resulted in a 1.3 million ton decline in metallurgical coal volume, although volumes in the second half of 2009 began to increase on an improved economic outlook led by demand from Asian Pacific markets. Our 2009 revenues declined compared to 2008 and were primarily impacted by Australias lower annual export contract pricing that commenced on April 1, 2009 as compared to 2008s record pricing and the overall decline in volume. Lower revenues were also driven by the decline in Trading and Brokerage revenues that resulted from lower coal pricing volatility. The lower Australian and Trading and Brokerage revenues were partially offset by an increase in U.S. revenues per ton that reflect multi year contracts signed at higher prices in recent years. While our Segment Adjusted EBITDA reflects the lower revenue discussed above, our 2009 margins also reflect the impact of producing at reduced levels as well as higher sales related costs. In addition, our costs in Australia were higher due to two additional longwall moves compared to 2008 and the impact of mining in difficult geologic conditions that also included higher costs for overburden removal. Net income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the above items, as well as lower results from equity affiliates and decreased net gains on disposals of assets. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $457.9 million in 2009, or $1.64 per diluted share, 53.6% below 2008 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $987.9 million, or $3.60 per diluted share. 38 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 160.1 169.7 (9.6 ) (5.7 )% Midwestern U.S. Mining 31.8 30.7 1.1 3.6 % Australian Mining 22.3 23.4 (1.1 ) (4.7 )% Trading and Brokerage 29.4 31.2 (1.8 ) (5.8 )% Total tons sold 243.6 255.0 (11.4 ) (4.5 )% Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,612.6 $ 2,533.1 $ 79.5 3.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,303.8 1,154.6 149.2 12.9 % Australian Mining 1,678.0 2,242.8 (564.8 ) (25.2 )% Trading and Brokerage 391.0 601.8 (210.8 ) (35.0 )% Other 27.0 28.7 (1.7 ) (5.9 )% Total revenues $ 6,012.4 $ 6,561.0 $ (548.6 ) (8.4 )% 2009 revenues were below prior year driven by decreases in our Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage segments as discussed below: Australian Mining operations average sales price decreased 21.4% from the prior year reflecting the lower annual export contract pricing that commenced April 1, 2009 compared to the record pricing realized in 2008. The price decreases were combined with volume decreases from the prior year (4.7%) due to overall lower demand experienced in the first half of 2009. 2009 metallurgical coal shipments of 6.9 million tons were 1.3 million tons below prior year. In the second half of 2009, 5.0 million tons of metallurgical coal were shipped, reflecting a partial recovery from the lower metallurgical coal shipments that occurred in the first half of the year. Trading and Brokerage revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower coal pricing volatility in 2009 resulting in lower margins on trading transactions, partially offset by profit from business contracted in 2008 that was realized in 2009 on an international brokerage arrangement. These decreases to revenues were partially offset by revenue increases in our Midwestern U.S. and Western U.S. Mining segments as discussed below: Midwestern U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.3%) driven by the benefit of higher Illinois Basin prices and increased shipments, including purchased coal used to satisfy certain coal supply agreements. Western U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.2%) due to a combination of higher contract pricing and a shift in sales mix. Revenues were also higher due to increased shipments from our El Segundo Mine (commissioned in June 2008) and customer contract termination and restructuring agreements. These increases were partially offset by the prior year 39 Table of Contents revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million) and an overall volume decrease (5.7%) reflecting our planned Powder River Basin production decreases to match demand. Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 721.5 $ 681.3 $ 40.2 5.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 281.9 177.3 104.6 59.0 % Australian Mining 437.8 1,016.6 (578.8 ) (56.9 )% Trading and Brokerage 193.4 218.9 (25.5 ) (11.6 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year due to lower annual export contract pricing and lower sales volume due to reduced demand ($416.0 million) as discussed above. Also impacting the segments Adjusted EBITDA was higher production costs ($170.7 million) driven by increased overburden stripping ratios and decreased longwall mine performance, which included higher costs associated with two additional longwall moves in 2009 compared to 2008. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to prior year primarily due to lower net revenue discussed above. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher pricing ($205.5 million), partially offset by lower demand ($63.2 million), a prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million), higher sales related costs ($52.0 million) and lower productivity due to increased stripping ratios ($20.8 million). The impact of lower demand was partially mitigated by revenues from customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million). Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year primarily due to higher pricing ($110.7 million) and decreased commodity costs ($16.0 million), partially offset by higher costs associated with mining in more difficult geological conditions compared to the prior year ($20.7 million). Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (344.5 ) (247.2 ) (97.3 ) (39.4 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (405.2 ) (402.4 ) (2.8 ) (0.7 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (40.1 ) (48.2 ) 8.1 16.8 % Interest expense (201.2 ) (227.0 ) 25.8 11.4 % Interest income 8.1 10.0 (1.9 ) (19.0 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% 40 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from prior year primarily due to the lower Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above and lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense and asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease of $97.3 million in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the following: Lower results from equity affiliates ($69.1 million) primarily from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela). Carbones del Guasare incurred unfavorable results in 2009 compared to 2008 (our share of which was $25.6 million) due to lower productivity, higher operating costs and ongoing labor issues; in addition, we recognized a $34.7 million impairment loss on this investment. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning this joint venture interest. Lower net gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($49.7 million) was due primarily to a $54.0 million gain in the prior year from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. The above decreases to Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA were offset by lower costs associated with Btu Conversion activities ($16.9 million). Interest expense was lower than prior year due to lower variable interest rates on our Term Loan Facility and accounts receivable securitization program and lower average borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates reflecting lower fuel and re vegetation costs incurred in our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% Income tax provision (193.8 ) (191.4 ) (2.4 ) (1.3 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 457.9 987.9 (530.0 ) (53.6 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5.1 (28.8 ) 33.9 117.7 % Net income 463.0 959.1 (496.1 ) (51.7 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14.8 ) (6.2 ) (8.6 ) (138.7 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 448.2 $ 952.9 $ (504.7 ) (53.0 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. 41 Table of Contents Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the strengthening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar ($139.6 million; exchange rate rose 29% in 2009 compared to a 21% decrease in 2008, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.2041 $ (0.1888 ) The prior year release of a foreign valuation allowance related to our Australian net operating loss carry forwards ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. The above increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower pre tax earnings in 2009, which drove a decrease to the income tax provision ($184.6 million). Income from discontinued operations increased compared to the prior year as the prior year included operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine, and an $11.7 million write off of a coal excise tax receivable in the first quarter of 2008. In late 2008, legislation was passed which contained provisions that allowed for the refund of coal excise tax collected on certain coal shipments. In 2009, we received a coal excise tax refund resulting in approximately $35 million, net of income taxes, recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund). Partially offsetting the 2009 excise tax refund were operating losses associated with discontinued operations and assets held for sale ($20.6 million) and a $10.0 million loss on the sale of our Chain Valley Mine in Australia. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Summary Higher average sales prices and volumes across all operating regions, particularly in Australia, contributed to an increase in revenues in 2008 compared to 2007. Segment Adjusted EBITDA rose primarily on the higher pricing mentioned above and favorable results from Trading and Brokerage. Increases in sales prices and volumes were partially offset by higher commodity, material, supply, sales related and labor costs in all operating regions. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $987.9 million in 2008, or $3.60 per diluted share, 123.7% above 2007 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $441.6 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 169.7 161.4 8.3 5.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 30.7 29.6 1.1 3.7 % Australian Mining 23.4 20.4 3.0 14.7 % Trading and Brokerage 31.2 24.1 7.1 29.5 % Total tons sold 255.0 235.5 19.5 8.3 % 42 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,533.1 $ 2,063.2 $ 469.9 22.8 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,154.6 987.1 167.5 17.0 % Australian Mining 2,242.8 1,117.6 1,125.2 100.7 % Trading and Brokerage 601.8 320.7 281.1 87.7 % Other 28.7 35.2 (6.5 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,561.0 $ 4,523.8 $ 2,037.2 45.0 % Total revenues increased in 2008 compared to the prior year across all operating segments. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: An increase in average sales price at our Australian Mining operations (75.0%), primarily driven by the strength of metallurgical coal prices on our Australian contracts that reprice annually in the second quarter of each year. U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (15.2%) driven by the benefit of higher priced coal supply agreements signed in recent years. Australias volumes increased over the prior year (14.7%) from strong demand during the first three quarters of 2008 and additional production from recently completed mines. Year over year increases were partially offset by heavy rainfall and flooding in Queensland during the first quarter of 2008 and customer shipment deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic slowdown. Increased demand also led to higher volumes across our U.S. operating segments, which overcame slightly lower volumes at some of our Midwestern U.S. Mining surface operations due to poor weather in that operating region that impacted production during the first and second quarters. The volume increase of 5.1% at our Western U.S. Mining operations resulted from greater throughput from capital improvements and contributions from our new El Segundo Mine, partially offset by the flooding in the midwestern U.S. that impacted railroad shipping performance related to western U.S. production during the second quarter of 2008. Trading and Brokerage revenues increased over the prior year due to increased trading positions allowing us to capture market movements derived from the volatility of both domestic and international coal markets. Also impacting year over year revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations was an agreement to recover previously recognized postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs of $56.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. 43 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 681.3 $ 595.4 $ 85.9 14.4 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 177.3 200.0 (22.7 ) (11.4 )% Australian Mining 1,016.6 167.2 849.4 508.0 % Trading and Brokerage 218.9 116.6 102.3 87.7 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.1 $ 1,079.2 $ 1,014.9 94.0 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2008 over the prior year primarily driven by an overall increase in average sales prices per ton across the region ($2.10) and higher volumes in the region due to increased demand and greater throughput as a result of capital improvements. Also contributing to the increase was the recovery of postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs discussed above. Partially offsetting the pricing and volume contributions were higher per ton costs ($1.78). The cost increases were primarily due to higher sales related costs, higher material, supply and labor costs, higher repair and maintenance costs in the Powder River Basin and increased commodity costs, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives pricing. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2008 as increases in average sales price per ton ($4.22) were offset by cost increases resulting from higher costs for commodities, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives prices, as well as higher material, supply and labor costs. Heavy rains and flooding in the midwestern U.S. affected sales volume at some of our mines, particularly in the first half of the year. Also affecting the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment was the decrease in revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants in the prior year ($28.9 million) due to the producers exiting the synthetic fuel market after expiration of federal tax credits at the end of 2007. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 primarily due to higher pricing negotiated in the second quarter of 2008 ($41.06 per ton), higher overall volumes as a result of strong export demand and contributions from our recently completed mines and lower demurrage costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher fuel costs, an increase in labor and overburden removal expenses and higher contractor costs (five of ten Australian mines are managed utilizing contract miners). Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 over the prior year due to increased trading volumes and higher coal price volatility. 44 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.1 $ 1,079.2 $ 1,014.9 94.0 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (247.2 ) (109.5 ) (137.7 ) (125.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (402.4 ) (346.3 ) (56.1 ) (16.2 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.2 ) (23.7 ) (24.5 ) (103.4 )% Interest expense (227.0 ) (235.8 ) 8.8 3.7 % Interest income 10.0 7.0 3.0 42.9 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,179.3 $ 370.9 $ 808.4 218.0 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased over the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, and higher asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the following: Higher selling and administrative expenses ($54.7 million) primarily driven by an increase in performance based incentive costs and legal expenses; Cost reimbursement and partner fees received in the prior year for the Prairie State project, primarily related to the entrance of new project partners ($29.5 million); Lower net gains on disposals or exchanges of assets ($15.7 million). 2008 activity included a gain of $54.0 million on the sale of approximately 58 million tons of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. 2007 activity included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of oil and gas rights and assets in more than 860,000 acres in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for coal reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. The prior year also included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands to the Prairie State equity partners; and Lower equity income ($15.5 million) from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela) and higher costs associated with Btu Conversion activities of $14.3 million in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was higher in 2008 compared to the prior year because of increased depletion across our operating platform resulting from the volume increases and the impact of mining higher value coal reserves. In addition, depreciation and depletion increases resulted from our recently completed Australian mines and depletion at our El Segundo Mine. Asset retirement obligation expense increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to an increase in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates that reflect higher fuel, labor and re vegetation costs, as well as an overall increase in the number of acres disturbed. The addition of the El Segundo Mine, which was completed in June 2008, also contributed to higher asset retirement obligation expense. 45 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,179.3 $ 370.9 $ 808.4 218.0 % Income tax (provision) benefit (191.4 ) 70.7 (262.1 ) (370.7 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 987.9 441.6 546.3 123.7 % Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (28.8 ) (180.1 ) 151.3 84.0 % Net income 959.1 261.5 697.6 266.8 % Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (6.2 ) 2.3 (8.5 ) (369.6 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 952.9 $ 263.8 $ 689.1 261.2 % Net income attributable to common stockholders increased in 2008 compared to the prior year due to the increase in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense in 2008 due to higher pre tax earnings ($282.9 million); and Valuation allowance release against federal net operating loss credits recognized into income in 2007 ($197.8 million); partially offset by Income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the weakening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar in 2008 ($121.2 million; exchange rate fell 21% in 2008 compared to an 11% increase in 2007, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.7913 $ (0.1888 ) $ 0.0903 The favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in 2008 ($106.2 million); and The release of a foreign valuation allowance against a portion of our Australian net operating loss carryforwards in 2008 ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a lower loss from discontinued operations as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred for Patriot operations in 2007. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 related to operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine, and an $11.7 million write off of an excise tax refund receivable (net of tax) as a result of an April 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Outlook Near Term Outlook Global economies are showing signs of improvement, with 2010 economic forecasts estimating a 2.6 to 4.0% expansion although slower than expected economic improvement could temper these estimates. The 46 Table of Contents Asia Pacific markets are expected to continue to outpace the U.S. and European markets in economic growth and therefore electricity generation and steel production. For 2009, China and India were the only steel producing majors to outpace prior year levels, with all other nations 23% lower on average. For 2010, the World Steel Association estimates global steel production will increase 9 percent over 2009. Globally, 72 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation are under construction and expected to come on line during 2010, more than 70% of which are new units in China and India. New global coal fueled generation for 2010 is estimated to require approximately 300 million tons of new annual coal demand. In the U.S., higher coal use caused by colder winter weather lowered utility stockpiles an estimated 25 to 30 million tons between December 2009 and mid January 2010. As of February 15, 2010, utility stockpiles were approximately 150 to 155 million tons, 24% above the 10 year average and 6% above the year ago level. We believe U.S. coal demand could rise 60 to 80 million tons based on economic growth, increasing industrial production and an expected reduction of coal to gas switching due to rising natural gas prices. Conversely, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates coal production will be 43 million tons lower in 2010, in part due to production declines initiated in 2009. With rising demand and lower production, utility coal inventories are likely to be reduced. As of January 26, 2010, we are targeting full year 2010 production of approximately 185 to 195 million tons in the U.S. and 26 to 28 million tons in Australia. Total 2010 sales are expected to be in a range of 240 to 260 million tons. We may continue to adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand. We are fully contracted for 2010 at planned production levels in the U.S. As of January 26, 2010 we had 4.5 to 5.5 million tons of Australian metallurgical coal unpriced for 2010, along with 6.5 to 7.0 million tons of unpriced export thermal coal. Unpriced 2010 volumes are primarily planned for deliveries over the last three quarters of 2010. We continue to manage costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. To mitigate the external cost pressures, we have an ongoing company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of below optimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. We rely on ongoing access to the worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly, many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. Coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for each of the past six years, with consumption growing nearly twice as fast as total energy use. The International Energy Agencys (IEA) World Energy Outlook estimates world primary energy demand will grow 40% between 2007 and 2030, with demand for coal rising 53%. China and India alone account for more than half of the expected incremental energy demand. Coal is expected to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide, with its share of the power generation mix projected to rise to 44% in 2030. Currently, 217 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity 47 Table of Contents generating plants are under construction around the world, representing more than 800 million tons of annual coal demand expected to come online in the next several years. In the U.S., 16 gigawatts of new coal based generating capacity have been completed in 2009 or are under construction, representing approximately 65 million tons of annual coal demand when they come online over the next three to five years as expected. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as CTG and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel such as CTL, which is estimated to add nearly 70 million tons of annual U.S. coal demand by 2035. In addition, China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. The IEA projects natural gas demand will grow 1.5% per year to just under 4,310 billion cubic meters in 2030. The biggest increase in absolute terms occurs in the Middle East, which holds the majority of the worlds proven reserves, and non OECD Asia. North America and Eastern Europe/Eurasia are expected to remain the leading gas consumers in 2030, even though their demand is expected to rise less in percentage terms than almost anywhere else globally. Globally, the share of renewables is projected to rise four percentage points to 22% between 2007 and 2030, with most of the growth coming from non hydro sources. Nuclear power is expected to grow in all major regions with the exception of Europe, but its share in total generation is expected to fall between 2007 and 2030. We continue to support clean coal technology development and other initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation in a number of projects in the U.S., China and Australia. In addition, clean coal technology development in the U.S. is being accelerated by funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and by the formation of an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the commercial development of clean coal technologies. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations forces electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable (through our securitization program). Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, federal coal lease payments, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of our 5.875% and 6.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures. We generally fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. We believe our available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will be sufficient in the near term. As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $988.8 million and $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. 48 Table of Contents The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Protection Act), which was effective January 1, 2008, increased the long term funding targets for single employer pension plans from 90% to 100%. At risk plans, as defined by the Pension Protection Act, are restricted from making full lump sum payments and from increasing benefits unless they are funded immediately, and also requires that the plan give participants notice regarding the at risk status of the plan. If a plan falls below 60%, lump sum payments are prohibited and participant benefit accruals cease. As of December 31, 2009, our pension plans were approximately 77% funded, before considering planned 2010 contributions. Our minimum funding requirement for 2010 is approximately $3 million, and the qualified plans would not be considered at risk. Using current assumptions, our 2011 minimum funding requirement would be approximately $98 million. We also have a share repurchase program that has an available capacity of $700.4 million at December 31, 2009. While no repurchases were made in 2009 under the program, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2009 decreased $356.3 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the decline in operating cash flows generated from our Australian mining operations on lower volumes and lower average pricing and the timing of cash flows from our working capital, primarily driven by foreign income tax payments related to prior year earnings. The decrease in cash used in discontinued operations of $117.4 million was primarily due to approximately $59 million of cash received related to coal excise tax refunds in 2009 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund) and lower current year payments related to Patriot discontinued operations. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased $11.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower federal coal lease expenditures of $54.9 million in 2009, partially offset by higher spending for our share of the Prairie State construction costs and additional investments in equity affiliates and joint venture projects in the prior year. Capital expenditures in 2009 were consistent with prior year as current year spending related to the development of our Bear Run Mine was offset by prior year spending related to the completion of our El Segundo Mine and expenditures for our blending and loadout facility at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine in the Western U.S. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $384.7 million, primarily due to 2008 payments related to the repurchase of common stock ($199.8 million), the acquisition of noncontrolling interests relating to our Millennium Mine ($110.1 million) and payments on our revolving line of credit ($97.7 million). During 2009, we purchased $10.0 million face value of our 6.84% Series A bonds and $10.0 million face value of our 6.84% Series C bonds for a combined total of $19.0 million. 49 Table of Contents Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted of the following: December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 490.3 $ 490.3 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 2066 371.5 369.9 7.375% Senior Notes due November 2016 650.0 650.0 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013 650.0 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026 247.1 247.0 5.875% Senior Notes due March 2016 218.1 218.1 6.84% Series C Bonds due December 2016 33.0 43.0 6.34% Series B Bonds due December 2014 15.0 18.0 6.84% Series A Bonds due December 2014 10.0 Capital lease obligations 67.5 81.2 Fair value hedge adjustment 8.4 15.1 Other 1.4 1.0 Total $ 2,752.3 $ 2,793.6 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2009. Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2009, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility was LIBOR plus 0.75%, or a total of 1.0%. We must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings and $315.7 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Other Long Term Debt. A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Third party Security Ratings. The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on the Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of 50 Table of Contents creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement. On August 7, 2009, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2010 are anticipated to be between $600 million to $650 million. The planned expenditures include sustaining capital at our existing mines, completion of our Bear Run Mine in western Indiana, expansion of our metallurgical and thermal coal export platform in Australia to serve the growth markets in Asia and funding of our Prairie State investment. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due By Year Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,219.5 $ 203.4 $ 884.8 $ 964.8 $ 3,166.5 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 80.3 15.1 30.2 35.0 Operating lease obligations 468.1 96.4 153.6 100.3 117.8 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 70.4 70.4 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 79.9 11.3 16.8 15.0 36.8 Take or pay obligations(2) 1,864.4 110.7 297.4 310.4 1,145.9 Other long term liabilities(3) 1,485.5 151.0 300.3 292.6 741.6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 9,268.1 $ 658.3 $ 1,683.1 $ 1,718.1 $ 5,208.6 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. (2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal, some of which extend to 2040, including amounts relating to export facilities currently under construction which are expected to be completed in 2010. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2009, we had $70.4 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $0.9 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next five years. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures primarily relate to the replacement and improvement of equipment and facilities at existing mines. We do not expect any of the $113.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. 51 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (such as self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2009: Workers Reclamation Lease Compensation Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self bonding $ 821.9 $ $ $ $ 821.9 Surety bonds 772.3 116.3 8.7 57.3 954.6 Letters of credit 34.9 43.0 237.8 315.7 $ 1,629.1 $ 116.3 $ 51.7 $ 295.1 $ 2,092.2 (1) Other includes the six letter of credit obligations described below and an additional $61.1 million in letters of credit and surety bonds related to collateral for surety companies, road maintenance, performance guarantees and other operations. We own a 37.5% interest in Dominion Terminal Associates, a partnership that operates a coal export terminal in Newport News, Virginia under a 30 year lease that permits the partnership to purchase the terminal at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount. The partners have severally (but not jointly) agreed to make payments under various agreements which in the aggregate provide the partnership with sufficient funds to pay rents and to cover the principal and interest payments on the floating rate industrial revenue bonds issued by the Peninsula Ports Authority, and which are supported by letters of credit from a commercial bank. As of December 31, 2009, our maximum reimbursement obligation to the commercial bank was in turn supported by four letters of credit totaling $42.7 million. We are party to an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make special contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.) and continues under this process as of December 31, 2009. As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. At December 31, 2009, we have a $154.3 million letter of credit for collateral for bank guarantees issued with respect to certain reclamation and performance obligations related to some of our Australian mines. Other Guarantees. See the Other Guarantees section of Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other guarantees. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Under our accounts receivable securitization program in place at December 31, 2009, a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary were sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit 52 Table of Contents (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The securitization program was renewed in May 2009 and amended in December 2009, and extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with receivables sold to the Conduit removed from our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of interest in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $254.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and $275.0 million as of December 31, 2008 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounts receivable securitization program). On January 25, 2010, the receivables purchase agreement for the accounts receivable securitization program was amended and restated to add a second multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit as a purchaser. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $76.8 million, while funding payments were $110.3 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 6.7 $ (5.7 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 98.3 $ (84.6 ) 53 Table of Contents Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.6 $ (0.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (46.1 ) $ 52.2 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 10.92 years at December 31, 2009. Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $40.1 million, and payments totaled $12.4 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ. Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three hierarchy Levels 1, 2 and 3 (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis 54 Table of Contents adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. At December 31, 2009, 5% of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. At December 31, 2008, the percentage of Level 3 net financial assets compared to the total net financial liabilities is not meaningful due to the overall liability position at December 31, 2008. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, emission allowances, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter, direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities to support our coal trading related activities (coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. We perform a VaR analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter and brokerage coal trading. The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical 55 Table of Contents chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not capture the loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR. The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the actual low, high, and average VaR for our coal trading portfolio were $2.7 million, $15.9 million, and $8.7 million, respectively. Our VaR decreased over the prior year due to less price volatility and lower overall prices in the U.S. and international coal markets. As of December 31, 2009, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage of Expiration Portfolio Total 2010 46 % 2011 51 % 2012 3 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Nonperformance and Credit Risk The fair value of our assets and liabilities reflect adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our concentration of nonperformance and credit risk is substantially with electric utilities, steel producers, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions. We conduct our various hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, and fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks. In light of the recent turmoil in the financial markets, we continue to closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.05 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $82 million for 2010. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $17 million for 2010. The chart at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2009. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.4 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $0.4 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $4.2 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $130 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 93% and 90% of our worldwide sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2009 and 2008, respectively. We are fully contracted for 2010 at planned production levels in the U.S. We had 11 to 12.5 million tons remaining to be priced for 2010 in Australia at January 26, 2010. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of fixed price contracts, cost plus contracts and a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, which are primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 130 to 135 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2010. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $31 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $14 million. Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 345,000 to 355,000 tons of explosives during 2010 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $6 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $3 million. 57 Table of Contents Notional Amounts and Fair Value.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the worlds largest private sector coal company, with majority interests in 28 coal mining operations in the U.S. and Australia. In 2009, we produced 210.0 million tons of coal and sold 243.6 million tons of coal. For 2009, our U.S. sales represented 19% of U.S. coal consumption and were approximately 50% greater than the sales of our closest U.S. competitor. We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining, and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining Segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. In 2009, metallurgical coal was approximately 3% of our total sales volume, but represented a larger share of our revenue, approximately 23%. We typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). During 2009, approximately 93% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2009, 81% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 17% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations. Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, as well as the management of our vast coal reserve and real estate holdings. We continue to pursue development of coal fueled generating and Btu Conversion projects in areas of the U.S. where electricity demand is strong and where there is access to land, water, transmission lines and low cost coal. Coal fueled generating projects may involve mine mouth generating plants using our surface lands and coal reserves. Our ultimate role in these projects could take numerous forms, including, but not limited to, equity partner, contract miner or coal sales. Currently, we own 5.06% of the 1,600 megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus that is under construction in Washington County, Illinois. We are determining how to best participate in Btu Conversion technologies to economically convert our coal resources to natural gas and transportation fuels through the Kentucky NewGas and GreatPoint Energy projects in the U.S. We are also advancing the development of clean coal technologies, including carbon 37 Table of Contents capture and sequestration, through a number of initiatives that include the FutureGen Alliance and university research programs in the U.S., GreenGen in China and COAL21 Fund in Australia. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by the rate of the economic recovery, adverse weather conditions, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the availability of transportation for coal shipments. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts, or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs, or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Summary Our overall results for 2009 compared to 2008 reflect the unfavorable impact of lower global demand for coal as a result of the global economic recession. Despite the recession, our 2009 Adjusted EBITDA was the second highest in our 126 year history and second only to our 2008 Adjusted EBITDA. We also ended 2009 with total available liquidity of $2.5 billion. We continue to focus on strong cost control and productivity improvements, increased contributions from our high margin operations and exercising tight capital discipline. Our 2009 tons sold were below prior year levels reflecting planned production reductions in the Powder River Basin to match lower demand, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the full year operation of our El Segundo Mine in the Southwest. In the U.S., the decreased demand from lower industrial output, lower natural gas prices that resulted in higher fuel switching, and higher coal stockpiles in the U.S. led to an 8.5 million ton decline in sales volume. In Australia, lower demand from steel customers resulted in a 1.3 million ton decline in metallurgical coal volume, although volumes in the second half of 2009 began to increase on an improved economic outlook led by demand from Asian Pacific markets. Our 2009 revenues declined compared to 2008 and were primarily impacted by Australias lower annual export contract pricing that commenced on April 1, 2009 as compared to 2008s record pricing and the overall decline in volume. Lower revenues were also driven by the decline in Trading and Brokerage revenues that resulted from lower coal pricing volatility. The lower Australian and Trading and Brokerage revenues were partially offset by an increase in U.S. revenues per ton that reflect multi year contracts signed at higher prices in recent years. While our Segment Adjusted EBITDA reflects the lower revenue discussed above, our 2009 margins also reflect the impact of producing at reduced levels as well as higher sales related costs. In addition, our costs in Australia were higher due to two additional longwall moves compared to 2008 and the impact of mining in difficult geologic conditions that also included higher costs for overburden removal. Net income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the above items, as well as lower results from equity affiliates and decreased net gains on disposals of assets. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $457.9 million in 2009, or $1.64 per diluted share, 53.6% below 2008 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $987.9 million, or $3.60 per diluted share. 38 Table of Contents Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 160.1 169.7 (9.6 ) (5.7 )% Midwestern U.S. Mining 31.8 30.7 1.1 3.6 % Australian Mining 22.3 23.4 (1.1 ) (4.7 )% Trading and Brokerage 29.4 31.2 (1.8 ) (5.8 )% Total tons sold 243.6 255.0 (11.4 ) (4.5 )% Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,612.6 $ 2,533.1 $ 79.5 3.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,303.8 1,154.6 149.2 12.9 % Australian Mining 1,678.0 2,242.8 (564.8 ) (25.2 )% Trading and Brokerage 391.0 601.8 (210.8 ) (35.0 )% Other 27.0 28.7 (1.7 ) (5.9 )% Total revenues $ 6,012.4 $ 6,561.0 $ (548.6 ) (8.4 )% 2009 revenues were below prior year driven by decreases in our Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage segments as discussed below: Australian Mining operations average sales price decreased 21.4% from the prior year reflecting the lower annual export contract pricing that commenced April 1, 2009 compared to the record pricing realized in 2008. The price decreases were combined with volume decreases from the prior year (4.7%) due to overall lower demand experienced in the first half of 2009. 2009 metallurgical coal shipments of 6.9 million tons were 1.3 million tons below prior year. In the second half of 2009, 5.0 million tons of metallurgical coal were shipped, reflecting a partial recovery from the lower metallurgical coal shipments that occurred in the first half of the year. Trading and Brokerage revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower coal pricing volatility in 2009 resulting in lower margins on trading transactions, partially offset by profit from business contracted in 2008 that was realized in 2009 on an international brokerage arrangement. These decreases to revenues were partially offset by revenue increases in our Midwestern U.S. and Western U.S. Mining segments as discussed below: Midwestern U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.3%) driven by the benefit of higher Illinois Basin prices and increased shipments, including purchased coal used to satisfy certain coal supply agreements. Western U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.2%) due to a combination of higher contract pricing and a shift in sales mix. Revenues were also higher due to increased shipments from our El Segundo Mine (commissioned in June 2008) and customer contract termination and restructuring agreements. These increases were partially offset by the prior year 39 Table of Contents revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million) and an overall volume decrease (5.7%) reflecting our planned Powder River Basin production decreases to match demand. Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 721.5 $ 681.3 $ 40.2 5.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 281.9 177.3 104.6 59.0 % Australian Mining 437.8 1,016.6 (578.8 ) (56.9 )% Trading and Brokerage 193.4 218.9 (25.5 ) (11.6 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year due to lower annual export contract pricing and lower sales volume due to reduced demand ($416.0 million) as discussed above. Also impacting the segments Adjusted EBITDA was higher production costs ($170.7 million) driven by increased overburden stripping ratios and decreased longwall mine performance, which included higher costs associated with two additional longwall moves in 2009 compared to 2008. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to prior year primarily due to lower net revenue discussed above. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher pricing ($205.5 million), partially offset by lower demand ($63.2 million), a prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million), higher sales related costs ($52.0 million) and lower productivity due to increased stripping ratios ($20.8 million). The impact of lower demand was partially mitigated by revenues from customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million). Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year primarily due to higher pricing ($110.7 million) and decreased commodity costs ($16.0 million), partially offset by higher costs associated with mining in more difficult geological conditions compared to the prior year ($20.7 million). Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (344.5 ) (247.2 ) (97.3 ) (39.4 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (405.2 ) (402.4 ) (2.8 ) (0.7 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (40.1 ) (48.2 ) 8.1 16.8 % Interest expense (201.2 ) (227.0 ) 25.8 11.4 % Interest income 8.1 10.0 (1.9 ) (19.0 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% 40 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from prior year primarily due to the lower Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above and lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense and asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease of $97.3 million in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the following: Lower results from equity affiliates ($69.1 million) primarily from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela). Carbones del Guasare incurred unfavorable results in 2009 compared to 2008 (our share of which was $25.6 million) due to lower productivity, higher operating costs and ongoing labor issues; in addition, we recognized a $34.7 million impairment loss on this investment. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning this joint venture interest. Lower net gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($49.7 million) was due primarily to a $54.0 million gain in the prior year from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. The above decreases to Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA were offset by lower costs associated with Btu Conversion activities ($16.9 million). Interest expense was lower than prior year due to lower variable interest rates on our Term Loan Facility and accounts receivable securitization program and lower average borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates reflecting lower fuel and re vegetation costs incurred in our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% Income tax provision (193.8 ) (191.4 ) (2.4 ) (1.3 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 457.9 987.9 (530.0 ) (53.6 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5.1 (28.8 ) 33.9 117.7 % Net income 463.0 959.1 (496.1 ) (51.7 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14.8 ) (6.2 ) (8.6 ) (138.7 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 448.2 $ 952.9 $ (504.7 ) (53.0 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. 41 Table of Contents Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the strengthening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar ($139.6 million; exchange rate rose 29% in 2009 compared to a 21% decrease in 2008, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.2041 $ (0.1888 ) The prior year release of a foreign valuation allowance related to our Australian net operating loss carry forwards ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. The above increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower pre tax earnings in 2009, which drove a decrease to the income tax provision ($184.6 million). Income from discontinued operations increased compared to the prior year as the prior year included operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine, and an $11.7 million write off of a coal excise tax receivable in the first quarter of 2008. In late 2008, legislation was passed which contained provisions that allowed for the refund of coal excise tax collected on certain coal shipments. In 2009, we received a coal excise tax refund resulting in approximately $35 million, net of income taxes, recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund). Partially offsetting the 2009 excise tax refund were operating losses associated with discontinued operations and assets held for sale ($20.6 million) and a $10.0 million loss on the sale of our Chain Valley Mine in Australia. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Summary Higher average sales prices and volumes across all operating regions, particularly in Australia, contributed to an increase in revenues in 2008 compared to 2007. Segment Adjusted EBITDA rose primarily on the higher pricing mentioned above and favorable results from Trading and Brokerage. Increases in sales prices and volumes were partially offset by higher commodity, material, supply, sales related and labor costs in all operating regions. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $987.9 million in 2008, or $3.60 per diluted share, 123.7% above 2007 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $441.6 million, or $1.64 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 169.7 161.4 8.3 5.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 30.7 29.6 1.1 3.7 % Australian Mining 23.4 20.4 3.0 14.7 % Trading and Brokerage 31.2 24.1 7.1 29.5 % Total tons sold 255.0 235.5 19.5 8.3 % 42 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,533.1 $ 2,063.2 $ 469.9 22.8 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,154.6 987.1 167.5 17.0 % Australian Mining 2,242.8 1,117.6 1,125.2 100.7 % Trading and Brokerage 601.8 320.7 281.1 87.7 % Other 28.7 35.2 (6.5 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,561.0 $ 4,523.8 $ 2,037.2 45.0 % Total revenues increased in 2008 compared to the prior year across all operating segments. The primary drivers of the increases included the following: An increase in average sales price at our Australian Mining operations (75.0%), primarily driven by the strength of metallurgical coal prices on our Australian contracts that reprice annually in the second quarter of each year. U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (15.2%) driven by the benefit of higher priced coal supply agreements signed in recent years. Australias volumes increased over the prior year (14.7%) from strong demand during the first three quarters of 2008 and additional production from recently completed mines. Year over year increases were partially offset by heavy rainfall and flooding in Queensland during the first quarter of 2008 and customer shipment deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the global economic slowdown. Increased demand also led to higher volumes across our U.S. operating segments, which overcame slightly lower volumes at some of our Midwestern U.S. Mining surface operations due to poor weather in that operating region that impacted production during the first and second quarters. The volume increase of 5.1% at our Western U.S. Mining operations resulted from greater throughput from capital improvements and contributions from our new El Segundo Mine, partially offset by the flooding in the midwestern U.S. that impacted railroad shipping performance related to western U.S. production during the second quarter of 2008. Trading and Brokerage revenues increased over the prior year due to increased trading positions allowing us to capture market movements derived from the volatility of both domestic and international coal markets. Also impacting year over year revenues in our Western U.S. Mining operations was an agreement to recover previously recognized postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs of $56.9 million in the second quarter of 2008. 43 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 681.3 $ 595.4 $ 85.9 14.4 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 177.3 200.0 (22.7 ) (11.4 )% Australian Mining 1,016.6 167.2 849.4 508.0 % Trading and Brokerage 218.9 116.6 102.3 87.7 % Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.1 $ 1,079.2 $ 1,014.9 94.0 % Adjusted EBITDA from our Western U.S. Mining operations increased in 2008 over the prior year primarily driven by an overall increase in average sales prices per ton across the region ($2.10) and higher volumes in the region due to increased demand and greater throughput as a result of capital improvements. Also contributing to the increase was the recovery of postretirement healthcare and reclamation costs discussed above. Partially offsetting the pricing and volume contributions were higher per ton costs ($1.78). The cost increases were primarily due to higher sales related costs, higher material, supply and labor costs, higher repair and maintenance costs in the Powder River Basin and increased commodity costs, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives pricing. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2008 as increases in average sales price per ton ($4.22) were offset by cost increases resulting from higher costs for commodities, net of hedging activities, driven by higher average fuel and explosives prices, as well as higher material, supply and labor costs. Heavy rains and flooding in the midwestern U.S. affected sales volume at some of our mines, particularly in the first half of the year. Also affecting the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment was the decrease in revenues from coal sold to synthetic fuel plants in the prior year ($28.9 million) due to the producers exiting the synthetic fuel market after expiration of federal tax credits at the end of 2007. Our Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 primarily due to higher pricing negotiated in the second quarter of 2008 ($41.06 per ton), higher overall volumes as a result of strong export demand and contributions from our recently completed mines and lower demurrage costs. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher fuel costs, an increase in labor and overburden removal expenses and higher contractor costs (five of ten Australian mines are managed utilizing contract miners). Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2008 over the prior year due to increased trading volumes and higher coal price volatility. 44 Table of Contents Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,094.1 $ 1,079.2 $ 1,014.9 94.0 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA (247.2 ) (109.5 ) (137.7 ) (125.8 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (402.4 ) (346.3 ) (56.1 ) (16.2 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.2 ) (23.7 ) (24.5 ) (103.4 )% Interest expense (227.0 ) (235.8 ) 8.8 3.7 % Interest income 10.0 7.0 3.0 42.9 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,179.3 $ 370.9 $ 808.4 218.0 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased over the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation, depletion and amortization, and higher asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2008 compared to 2007 was due to the following: Higher selling and administrative expenses ($54.7 million) primarily driven by an increase in performance based incentive costs and legal expenses; Cost reimbursement and partner fees received in the prior year for the Prairie State project, primarily related to the entrance of new project partners ($29.5 million); Lower net gains on disposals or exchanges of assets ($15.7 million). 2008 activity included a gain of $54.0 million on the sale of approximately 58 million tons of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. 2007 activity included a gain of $50.5 million on the exchange of oil and gas rights and assets in more than 860,000 acres in the Illinois Basin, West Virginia, New Mexico and the Powder River Basin for coal reserves in West Virginia and Kentucky and cash proceeds. The prior year also included a gain of $26.4 million on the sale of approximately 172 million tons of coal reserves and surface lands to the Prairie State equity partners; and Lower equity income ($15.5 million) from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela) and higher costs associated with Btu Conversion activities of $14.3 million in 2008. Depreciation, depletion and amortization was higher in 2008 compared to the prior year because of increased depletion across our operating platform resulting from the volume increases and the impact of mining higher value coal reserves. In addition, depreciation and depletion increases resulted from our recently completed Australian mines and depletion at our El Segundo Mine. Asset retirement obligation expense increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to an increase in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates that reflect higher fuel, labor and re vegetation costs, as well as an overall increase in the number of acres disturbed. The addition of the El Segundo Mine, which was completed in June 2008, also contributed to higher asset retirement obligation expense. 45 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Increase (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) to Income 2008 2007 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,179.3 $ 370.9 $ 808.4 218.0 % Income tax (provision) benefit (191.4 ) 70.7 (262.1 ) (370.7 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 987.9 441.6 546.3 123.7 % Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (28.8 ) (180.1 ) 151.3 84.0 % Net income 959.1 261.5 697.6 266.8 % Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (6.2 ) 2.3 (8.5 ) (369.6 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 952.9 $ 263.8 $ 689.1 261.2 % Net income attributable to common stockholders increased in 2008 compared to the prior year due to the increase in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense in 2008 due to higher pre tax earnings ($282.9 million); and Valuation allowance release against federal net operating loss credits recognized into income in 2007 ($197.8 million); partially offset by Income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the weakening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar in 2008 ($121.2 million; exchange rate fell 21% in 2008 compared to an 11% increase in 2007, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.7913 $ (0.1888 ) $ 0.0903 The favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in 2008 ($106.2 million); and The release of a foreign valuation allowance against a portion of our Australian net operating loss carryforwards in 2008 ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a lower loss from discontinued operations as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred for Patriot operations in 2007. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 related to operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine, and an $11.7 million write off of an excise tax refund receivable (net of tax) as a result of an April 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Outlook Near Term Outlook Global economies are showing signs of improvement, with 2010 economic forecasts estimating a 2.6 to 4.0% expansion although slower than expected economic improvement could temper these estimates. The 46 Table of Contents Asia Pacific markets are expected to continue to outpace the U.S. and European markets in economic growth and therefore electricity generation and steel production. For 2009, China and India were the only steel producing majors to outpace prior year levels, with all other nations 23% lower on average. For 2010, the World Steel Association estimates global steel production will increase 9 percent over 2009. Globally, 72 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation are under construction and expected to come on line during 2010, more than 70% of which are new units in China and India. New global coal fueled generation for 2010 is estimated to require approximately 300 million tons of new annual coal demand. In the U.S., higher coal use caused by colder winter weather lowered utility stockpiles an estimated 25 to 30 million tons between December 2009 and mid January 2010. As of February 15, 2010, utility stockpiles were approximately 150 to 155 million tons, 24% above the 10 year average and 6% above the year ago level. We believe U.S. coal demand could rise 60 to 80 million tons based on economic growth, increasing industrial production and an expected reduction of coal to gas switching due to rising natural gas prices. Conversely, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates coal production will be 43 million tons lower in 2010, in part due to production declines initiated in 2009. With rising demand and lower production, utility coal inventories are likely to be reduced. As of January 26, 2010, we are targeting full year 2010 production of approximately 185 to 195 million tons in the U.S. and 26 to 28 million tons in Australia. Total 2010 sales are expected to be in a range of 240 to 260 million tons. We may continue to adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand. We are fully contracted for 2010 at planned production levels in the U.S. As of January 26, 2010 we had 4.5 to 5.5 million tons of Australian metallurgical coal unpriced for 2010, along with 6.5 to 7.0 million tons of unpriced export thermal coal. Unpriced 2010 volumes are primarily planned for deliveries over the last three quarters of 2010. We continue to manage costs and operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. To mitigate the external cost pressures, we have an ongoing company wide initiative to instill best practices at all operations. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of below optimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. We rely on ongoing access to the worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly, many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. Coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for each of the past six years, with consumption growing nearly twice as fast as total energy use. The International Energy Agencys (IEA) World Energy Outlook estimates world primary energy demand will grow 40% between 2007 and 2030, with demand for coal rising 53%. China and India alone account for more than half of the expected incremental energy demand. Coal is expected to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide, with its share of the power generation mix projected to rise to 44% in 2030. Currently, 217 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity 47 Table of Contents generating plants are under construction around the world, representing more than 800 million tons of annual coal demand expected to come online in the next several years. In the U.S., 16 gigawatts of new coal based generating capacity have been completed in 2009 or are under construction, representing approximately 65 million tons of annual coal demand when they come online over the next three to five years as expected. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as CTG and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. The EIA continues to project an increase in demand for unconventional sources of transportation fuel such as CTL, which is estimated to add nearly 70 million tons of annual U.S. coal demand by 2035. In addition, China and India are developing CTG and CTL facilities. The IEA projects natural gas demand will grow 1.5% per year to just under 4,310 billion cubic meters in 2030. The biggest increase in absolute terms occurs in the Middle East, which holds the majority of the worlds proven reserves, and non OECD Asia. North America and Eastern Europe/Eurasia are expected to remain the leading gas consumers in 2030, even though their demand is expected to rise less in percentage terms than almost anywhere else globally. Globally, the share of renewables is projected to rise four percentage points to 22% between 2007 and 2030, with most of the growth coming from non hydro sources. Nuclear power is expected to grow in all major regions with the exception of Europe, but its share in total generation is expected to fall between 2007 and 2030. We continue to support clean coal technology development and other initiatives addressing global climate change through our participation in a number of projects in the U.S., China and Australia. In addition, clean coal technology development in the U.S. is being accelerated by funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and by the formation of an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the commercial development of clean coal technologies. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations forces electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions, including the sale of our accounts receivable (through our securitization program). Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, federal coal lease payments, interest costs and costs related to past mining obligations as well as acquisitions. Our ability to pay dividends, service our debt (interest and principal) and acquire new productive assets or businesses is dependent upon our ability to continue to generate cash from the primary sources noted above in excess of the primary uses. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of our 5.875% and 6.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures. We generally fund all of our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. We believe our available borrowing capacity and operating cash flows will be sufficient in the near term. As of December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents of $988.8 million and $1.5 billion of available borrowing capacity under our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. 48 Table of Contents The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Protection Act), which was effective January 1, 2008, increased the long term funding targets for single employer pension plans from 90% to 100%. At risk plans, as defined by the Pension Protection Act, are restricted from making full lump sum payments and from increasing benefits unless they are funded immediately, and also requires that the plan give participants notice regarding the at risk status of the plan. If a plan falls below 60%, lump sum payments are prohibited and participant benefit accruals cease. As of December 31, 2009, our pension plans were approximately 77% funded, before considering planned 2010 contributions. Our minimum funding requirement for 2010 is approximately $3 million, and the qualified plans would not be considered at risk. Using current assumptions, our 2011 minimum funding requirement would be approximately $98 million. We also have a share repurchase program that has an available capacity of $700.4 million at December 31, 2009. While no repurchases were made in 2009 under the program, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2009 decreased $356.3 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the decline in operating cash flows generated from our Australian mining operations on lower volumes and lower average pricing and the timing of cash flows from our working capital, primarily driven by foreign income tax payments related to prior year earnings. The decrease in cash used in discontinued operations of $117.4 million was primarily due to approximately $59 million of cash received related to coal excise tax refunds in 2009 (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund) and lower current year payments related to Patriot discontinued operations. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased $11.1 million in 2009 compared to the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower federal coal lease expenditures of $54.9 million in 2009, partially offset by higher spending for our share of the Prairie State construction costs and additional investments in equity affiliates and joint venture projects in the prior year. Capital expenditures in 2009 were consistent with prior year as current year spending related to the development of our Bear Run Mine was offset by prior year spending related to the completion of our El Segundo Mine and expenditures for our blending and loadout facility at our North Antelope Rochelle Mine in the Western U.S. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $384.7 million, primarily due to 2008 payments related to the repurchase of common stock ($199.8 million), the acquisition of noncontrolling interests relating to our Millennium Mine ($110.1 million) and payments on our revolving line of credit ($97.7 million). During 2009, we purchased $10.0 million face value of our 6.84% Series A bonds and $10.0 million face value of our 6.84% Series C bonds for a combined total of $19.0 million. 49 Table of Contents Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 consisted of the following: December 31, 2009 2008 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan under Senior Unsecured Credit Facility $ 490.3 $ 490.3 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 2066 371.5 369.9 7.375% Senior Notes due November 2016 650.0 650.0 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013 650.0 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026 247.1 247.0 5.875% Senior Notes due March 2016 218.1 218.1 6.84% Series C Bonds due December 2016 33.0 43.0 6.34% Series B Bonds due December 2014 15.0 18.0 6.84% Series A Bonds due December 2014 10.0 Capital lease obligations 67.5 81.2 Fair value hedge adjustment 8.4 15.1 Other 1.4 1.0 Total $ 2,752.3 $ 2,793.6 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Senior Unsecured Credit Facility, the 6.875% Senior Notes, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2009. Senior Unsecured Credit Facility. Our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility provides a $1.8 billion Revolving Credit Facility and a $950.0 million Term Loan Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility is intended to accommodate working capital needs, letters of credit, the funding of capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a $50.0 million sub facility available for same day swingline loan borrowings. Loans under the facility are available in U.S. dollars, with a sub facility under the Revolving Credit Facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to us in U.S. dollars with a sub facility available in Australian dollars, pounds sterling and euros. The interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility is based on a pricing grid tied to our leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. At December 31, 2009, the interest rate payable on the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility was LIBOR plus 0.75%, or a total of 1.0%. We must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The financial covenants also place limitations on our investments in joint ventures, unrestricted subsidiaries, indebtedness of non loan parties, and the imposition of liens on our assets. The Senior Unsecured Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings and $315.7 million letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Other Long Term Debt. A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Third party Security Ratings. The ratings for our Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and our Senior Unsecured Notes are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba1 rating, Standard Poors a BB+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB+ rating. The ratings on the Debentures are as follows: Moodys has issued a Ba3 rating, Standard Poors a B+ rating, and Fitch has issued a BB rating. These security ratings reflected the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, but rather an indication of 50 Table of Contents creditworthiness. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant the change. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Shelf Registration Statement. On August 7, 2009, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 as a well known seasoned issuer with the SEC. The registration was for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years, at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2010 are anticipated to be between $600 million to $650 million. The planned expenditures include sustaining capital at our existing mines, completion of our Bear Run Mine in western Indiana, expansion of our metallurgical and thermal coal export platform in Australia to serve the growth markets in Asia and funding of our Prairie State investment. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due By Year Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,219.5 $ 203.4 $ 884.8 $ 964.8 $ 3,166.5 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 80.3 15.1 30.2 35.0 Operating lease obligations 468.1 96.4 153.6 100.3 117.8 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 70.4 70.4 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 79.9 11.3 16.8 15.0 36.8 Take or pay obligations(2) 1,864.4 110.7 297.4 310.4 1,145.9 Other long term liabilities(3) 1,485.5 151.0 300.3 292.6 741.6 Total contractual cash obligations $ 9,268.1 $ 658.3 $ 1,683.1 $ 1,718.1 $ 5,208.6 (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. (2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal, some of which extend to 2040, including amounts relating to export facilities currently under construction which are expected to be completed in 2010. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. As of December 31, 2009, we had $70.4 million of purchase obligations for capital expenditures and $0.9 million of obligations related to federal coal reserve lease payments due over the next five years. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures primarily relate to the replacement and improvement of equipment and facilities at existing mines. We do not expect any of the $113.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. 51 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. We use a combination of surety bonds, corporate guarantees (such as self bonds) and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation, workers compensation, and coal lease obligations as follows as of December 31, 2009: Workers Reclamation Lease Compensation Obligations Obligations Obligations Other(1) Total (Dollars in millions) Self bonding $ 821.9 $ $ $ $ 821.9 Surety bonds 772.3 116.3 8.7 57.3 954.6 Letters of credit 34.9 43.0 237.8 315.7 $ 1,629.1 $ 116.3 $ 51.7 $ 295.1 $ 2,092.2 (1) Other includes the six letter of credit obligations described below and an additional $61.1 million in letters of credit and surety bonds related to collateral for surety companies, road maintenance, performance guarantees and other operations. We own a 37.5% interest in Dominion Terminal Associates, a partnership that operates a coal export terminal in Newport News, Virginia under a 30 year lease that permits the partnership to purchase the terminal at the end of the lease term for a nominal amount. The partners have severally (but not jointly) agreed to make payments under various agreements which in the aggregate provide the partnership with sufficient funds to pay rents and to cover the principal and interest payments on the floating rate industrial revenue bonds issued by the Peninsula Ports Authority, and which are supported by letters of credit from a commercial bank. As of December 31, 2009, our maximum reimbursement obligation to the commercial bank was in turn supported by four letters of credit totaling $42.7 million. We are party to an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) and TXU Europe Limited, an affiliate of our former parent corporation, under which we are required to make special contributions to two of our defined benefit pension plans and to maintain a $37.0 million letter of credit in favor of the PBGC. If we or the PBGC give notice of an intent to terminate one or more of the covered pension plans in which liabilities are not fully funded, or if we fail to maintain the letter of credit, the PBGC may draw down on the letter of credit and use the proceeds to satisfy liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The PBGC, however, is required to first apply amounts received from a $110.0 million guarantee in place from TXU Europe Limited in favor of the PBGC before it draws on our letter of credit. On November 19, 2002 TXU Europe Limited was placed under the administration process in the United Kingdom (a process similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.) and continues under this process as of December 31, 2009. As a result of these proceedings, TXU Europe Limited may be liquidated or otherwise reorganized in such a way as to relieve it of its obligations under its guarantee. At December 31, 2009, we have a $154.3 million letter of credit for collateral for bank guarantees issued with respect to certain reclamation and performance obligations related to some of our Australian mines. Other Guarantees. See the Other Guarantees section of Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our other guarantees. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program. Under our accounts receivable securitization program in place at December 31, 2009, a pool of eligible trade receivables contributed to our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary were sold, without recourse, to a multi seller, asset backed commercial paper conduit 52 Table of Contents (Conduit). Purchases by the Conduit are financed with the sale of highly rated commercial paper. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing our overall borrowing costs. The funding cost of the securitization program was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The securitization program was renewed in May 2009 and amended in December 2009, and extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually. The securitization transactions have been recorded as sales, with receivables sold to the Conduit removed from our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of interest in accounts receivable sold to the Conduit was $254.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and $275.0 million as of December 31, 2008 (see Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our accounts receivable securitization program). On January 25, 2010, the receivables purchase agreement for the accounts receivable securitization program was amended and restated to add a second multi seller asset backed commercial paper conduit as a purchaser. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Employee Related Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs and workers compensation obligations are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 for the pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $76.8 million, while funding payments were $110.3 million. Each of these liabilities are actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 6.7 $ (5.7 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 98.3 $ (84.6 ) 53 Table of Contents Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.6 $ (0.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (46.1 ) $ 52.2 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 10.92 years at December 31, 2009. Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $40.1 million, and payments totaled $12.4 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ. Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three hierarchy Levels 1, 2 and 3 (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis 54 Table of Contents adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. At December 31, 2009, 5% of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. At December 31, 2008, the percentage of Level 3 net financial assets compared to the total net financial liabilities is not meaningful due to the overall liability position at December 31, 2008. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, emission allowances, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in over the counter, direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities to support our coal trading related activities (coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. We perform a VaR analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter and brokerage coal trading. The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical 55 Table of Contents chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not capture the loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR. The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the actual low, high, and average VaR for our coal trading portfolio were $2.7 million, $15.9 million, and $8.7 million, respectively. Our VaR decreased over the prior year due to less price volatility and lower overall prices in the U.S. and international coal markets. As of December 31, 2009, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage of Expiration Portfolio Total 2010 46 % 2011 51 % 2012 3 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Nonperformance and Credit Risk The fair value of our assets and liabilities reflect adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our concentration of nonperformance and credit risk is substantially with electric utilities, steel producers, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral, requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions. We conduct our various hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, and fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks. In light of the recent turmoil in the financial markets, we continue to closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. 56 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards and options to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.05 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $82 million for 2010. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $17 million for 2010. The chart at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2009. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we manage fixed rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, after taking into consideration the effects of interest rate swaps, we had $2.4 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $0.4 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $4.2 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $130 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. We sold 93% and 90% of our worldwide sales volume under long term coal supply agreements during 2009 and 2008, respectively. We are fully contracted for 2010 at planned production levels in the U.S. We had 11 to 12.5 million tons remaining to be priced for 2010 in Australia at January 26, 2010. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of fixed price contracts, cost plus contracts and a combination of forward contracts with our suppliers and financial derivative contracts, which are primarily swap contracts with financial institutions. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 130 to 135 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2010. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $31 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $14 million. Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the chart at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 345,000 to 355,000 tons of explosives during 2010 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $6 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $3 million. 57 Table of Contents Notional Amounts and Fair Value.
