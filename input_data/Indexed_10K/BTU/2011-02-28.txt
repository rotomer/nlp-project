Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Share Repurchases On October 24, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. The repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer also has the authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside the share repurchase program. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Through 33 Table of Contents December 31, 2010, we have made repurchases of 7.7 million shares at a cost of $299.6 million ($199.8 million and $99.8 million in 2008 and 2006, respectively), leaving $700.4 million available for share repurchases under the program. The following table summarizes all share repurchases for the three months ended December 31, 2010: Maximum Dollar Value that May Yet Total Number of Be Used to Total Shares Purchased Repurchase Number of Average as Part of Publicly Shares Under the Shares Price per Announced Publicly Announced Period Purchased(1) Share Program Program (In millions) October 1 through October 31, 2010 1,392 $ 50.53 $ 700.4 November 1 through November 30, 2010 11,122 53.91 700.4 December 1 through December 31, 2010 70,087 63.98 700.4 Total 82,601 $ 62.40 (1) Represents shares withheld to cover the withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock, which are not a part of the share repurchase program. Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected financial and other data about us for the most recent five fiscal years. The following table and the discussion of our results of operations in 2010, 2009 and 2008 in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as reflected at the end of Item 6. Selected Financial Data and in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations those operations recently divested, as well as certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets. In October 2006, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel). Our results of operations include Excels results of operations from the date of acquisition. We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 from our audited financial statements. You should read the following table in 34 Table of Contents conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of operations for the historical periods included in the following table are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods. In addition, the Risk Factors section of Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report includes a discussion of risk factors that could impact our future results of operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the worlds largest private sector coal company, with majority interests in 28 coal mining operations in the U.S. and Australia. In 2010, we produced 218.4 million tons of coal and sold 245.9 million tons of coal. We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining Segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. In the U.S., we typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). In Australia, our production is sold primarily into the export metallurgical and thermal markets with an increasing number of the contracts negotiated with our customers on a quarterly basis. During 2010, approximately 91% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 84% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 14% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations. Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, as well as the management of our vast coal reserve and real estate holdings. We continue to pursue Btu Conversion projects that expand the uses of coal through CTL and CTG. Our participation in generation development projects involves using our surface lands and coal reserves as the basis for mine mouth plants, such as with our involvement in Prairie State. We are also advancing several initiatives associated with clean coal technologies, including CCS. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, availability of transportation for coal shipments, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the rate of the economic recovery. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our 36 Table of Contents mining costs or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Summary In the U.S., demand for coal rose approximately 75 million tons in 2010, led by a 5.5% increase in coal fueled generation and an 18 million ton rise in exports. The international coal markets strengthened in 2010 due to strong Asian demand growth and weather related generation recovery in the Atlantic markets, coupled with supply challenges across the major coal exporting nations of the Southern Hemisphere. Our analyses of general business conditions indicate the following: Seaborne coal demand increased an estimated 13% in 2010, led by a 32% recovery in global metallurgical coal demand; Pacific thermal coal demand for electricity generation rose 15% in 2010, while the Atlantic market declined 10%; Benchmark pricing of high quality, hard coking coal in the seaborne market has ranged between $200 to $225 per tonne since April 2010; The benchmark prompt seaborne thermal coal price in Newcastle, Australia rose 34% in 2010; U.S. coal generation accounted for nearly two thirds of the growth in total power output in 2010 due to new coal fueled generation, favorable weather, and a partial reversal of 2009s coal to gas switching; and Indexed U.S. coal prices rose in 2010 in all regions, with increases ranging from 30 to 50%. Our revenues increased compared to the prior year by $847.6 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year by $535.2 million, led by higher Australian pricing and sales volumes in the current year despite unfavorable weather related volume impacts that occurred late in 2010. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to the prior year by $347.2 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by increased income taxes, decreased Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and interest expense. We ended the year with total available liquidity of $2.7 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 163.8 160.1 3.7 2.3 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 29.7 31.8 (2.1 ) (6.6 )% Australian Mining 27.0 22.3 4.7 21.1 % Trading and Brokerage 25.4 29.4 (4.0 ) (13.6 )% Total tons sold 245.9 243.6 2.3 0.9 % 37 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,706.3 $ 2,612.6 $ 93.7 3.6 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,320.6 1,303.8 16.8 1.3 % Australian Mining 2,520.0 1,678.0 842.0 50.2 % Trading and Brokerage 291.1 391.0 (99.9 ) (25.5 )% Corporate and Other 22.0 27.0 (5.0 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,860.0 $ 6,012.4 $ 847.6 14.1 % The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 23.9%, led by increased pricing on seaborne metallurgical and thermal coals and a higher mix of metallurgical coal shipments. Volumes also increased in the current year (21.1%) driven by increased demand for metallurgical coal (metallurgical coal shipments of 9.8 million tons were 2.9 million tons, or 42%, greater than the prior year). These increases were muted to an extent by the flooding in Queensland in late 2010 that negatively impacted our production and also restricted throughput due to damage to the port and rail systems. The metallurgical coal demand increase reflects the strengthening of the coal markets as discussed above, coupled with prior year customer destocking of inventory and lower capacity utilization at steel customers. Western U.S. Mining operations revenues increased compared to the prior year due to increased sales volume (2.3%) driven by our Powder River Basin and Southwest regions due to increased customer demand and a higher weighted average sales price of 1.3%. In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements due to an increase in our weighted average sales price of 8.4% from contractual price increases were largely offset by decreased shipments (6.6%) on lower customer demand. Trading and Brokerage revenues were down primarily due to lower international brokerage revenues, unfavorable market movements on freight positions that support our export volumes and weather related shipment deferrals. Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 816.7 $ 721.5 $ 95.2 13.2 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 322.1 281.9 40.2 14.3 % Australian Mining 953.8 437.8 516.0 117.9 % Trading and Brokerage 77.2 193.4 (116.2 ) (60.1 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,169.8 $ 1,634.6 $ 535.2 32.7 % Our Australian Mining segment benefitted from a higher weighted average sales price ($413.0 million) and increased volumes ($127.9 million) as discussed above, and productivity improvements at our North Goonyella and Wambo underground mines along with fewer longwall move days in the current year ($116.0 million). Partially offsetting the above improvements were net higher adverse weather impacts 38 Table of Contents ($47.0 million) driven by the flooding in late 2010, unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($34.5 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced metallurgical coal shipments ($31.7 million) and increased demurrage costs ($10.7 million). Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to the higher volumes ($49.8 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($42.1 million) discussed above, lower repairs and maintenance costs due to timing of repairs and improved equipment efficiency ($35.0 million) and fewer longwall move days at our Twentymile Mine in the current year ($10.0 million), partially offset by prior year customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million) and increased commodity costs in the current year ($20.8 million). In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, a higher weighted average sales price ($98.5 million), as discussed above, was partially offset by lower volumes ($42.3 million) due to decreased demand and increased costs on lower productivity due to compliance measures and geological conditions at certain underground mines. Our Trading and Brokerage segment was down primarily due to the lower revenues as discussed above. Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,169.8 $ 1,634.6 $ 535.2 32.7 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1) (354.7 ) (344.5 ) (10.2 ) (3.0 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (440.9 ) (405.2 ) (35.7 ) (8.8 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.5 ) (40.1 ) (8.4 ) (20.9 )% Interest expense (222.1 ) (201.2 ) (20.9 ) (10.4 )% Interest income 9.6 8.1 1.5 18.5 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,113.2 $ 651.7 $ 461.5 70.8 % (1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was higher compared to the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense as discussed below: Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA: higher expense was primarily driven by a current year increase in selling and administrative expenses due to costs to support our business development and international expansion (e.g. headcount, travel, professional services, legal). We also incurred increased post mining costs driven by higher retiree healthcare amortization of actuarial losses and interest cost. These items were partially offset by improved results from equity affiliates primarily due to prior year losses of $54.6 million related to our equity investment in Carbones del Guasare, which included a $34.7 million impairment loss and $19.9 million of operating losses. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 39 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization: higher compared to the prior year due to increased production at our Australian mines with higher per ton depletion rates reflecting higher demand and additional depreciation expense associated with our new Bear Run Mine (commissioned in the second quarter of 2010). Interest expense: higher primarily due to refinancing charges ($9.3 million) associated with our new five year Credit Facility and charges ($8.4 million) associated with the extinguishment and refinancing of $650.0 million of senior notes. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,113.2 $ 651.7 $ 461.5 70.8 % Income tax provision (308.1 ) (193.8 ) (114.3 ) (59.0 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 805.1 457.9 347.2 75.8 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (2.9 ) 5.1 (8.0 ) 156.9 % Net income 802.2 463.0 339.2 73.3 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (28.2 ) (14.8 ) (13.4 ) (90.5 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 774.0 $ 448.2 $ 325.8 72.7 % Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to the prior year due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense due to higher current year earnings ($161.5 million) and current year income tax resulting from foreign earnings repatriation ($84.5 million), partially offset by A change in the valuation allowance ($46.4 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits, lower expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the larger increase in the Australian exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in the prior year compared to the current year ($26.8 million) as set forth in the table below, the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in the current year ($42.5 million), and lower expense in the current year due to the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination of the 2005 federal income tax year ($15.2 million). December 31, Rate Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 1.0163 $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.1194 $ 0.2041 Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2010 reflects a loss of $2.9 million as compared to income of $5.1 million in 2009 due primarily to a coal excise tax refund receivable of approximately $35 million recorded in 2009, partially offset by operating losses and loss on disposal of our Australian Chain Valley Mine in 2009. 40 Table of Contents Other The fair value of our foreign currency hedges increased approximately $434 million in 2010 mostly due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar in the current year. The increase is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Summary Our overall results for 2009 compared to 2008 reflect the unfavorable impact of lower global demand for coal as a result of the global economic recession. Despite the recession, our 2009 Adjusted EBITDA was the third highest in our 127 year history, only trailing 2008 and 2010. We also ended 2009 with total available liquidity of $2.5 billion. We continued to focus on strong cost control and productivity improvements, increased contributions from our high margin operations and exercising tight capital discipline. Our 2009 tons sold were below prior year levels reflecting planned production reductions in the Powder River Basin to match lower demand, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the full year operation of our El Segundo Mine in the Southwest. In the U.S., the decreased demand from lower industrial output, lower natural gas prices that resulted in higher fuel switching and higher coal stockpiles in the U.S. led to an 8.5 million ton decline in sales volume. In Australia, lower demand from steel customers resulted in a 1.3 million ton decline in metallurgical coal volume, although volumes in the second half of 2009 began to increase on an improved economic outlook led by demand from Asian Pacific markets. Our 2009 revenues declined compared to 2008 and were primarily impacted by Australias lower annual export contract pricing that commenced on April 1, 2009 as compared to 2008s record pricing and the overall decline in volume. Lower revenues were also driven by the decline in Trading and Brokerage revenues that resulted from lower coal pricing volatility. The lower Australian and Trading and Brokerage revenues were partially offset by an increase in U.S. revenues per ton that reflect multi year contracts signed at higher prices in recent years. While our Segment Adjusted EBITDA reflects the lower revenue discussed above, our 2009 margins also reflect the impact of producing at reduced levels as well as higher sales related costs. In addition, our costs in Australia were higher due to two additional longwall moves compared to 2008 and the impact of mining in difficult geologic conditions that also included higher costs for overburden removal. Net income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the above items, as well as lower results from equity affiliates and decreased net gains on disposals of assets. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $457.9 million in 2009, or $1.64 per diluted share, 53.6% below 2008 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $987.9 million, or $3.60 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 160.1 169.7 (9.6 ) (5.7 )% Midwestern U.S. Mining 31.8 30.7 1.1 3.6 % Australian Mining 22.3 23.4 (1.1 ) (4.7 )% Trading and Brokerage 29.4 31.2 (1.8 ) (5.8 )% Total tons sold 243.6 255.0 (11.4 ) (4.5 )% 41 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,612.6 $ 2,533.1 $ 79.5 3.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,303.8 1,154.6 149.2 12.9 % Australian Mining 1,678.0 2,242.8 (564.8 ) (25.2 )% Trading and Brokerage 391.0 601.8 (210.8 ) (35.0 )% Corporate and Other 27.0 28.7 (1.7 ) (5.9 )% Total revenues $ 6,012.4 $ 6,561.0 $ (548.6 ) (8.4 )% 2009 revenues were below the prior year driven by decreases in our Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage segments as discussed below: Australian Mining operations average sales price decreased 21.4% from the prior year reflecting the lower annual export contract pricing that commenced April 1, 2009 compared to the record pricing realized in 2008. The price decreases were combined with volume decreases from the prior year (4.7%) due to overall lower demand experienced in the first half of 2009. 2009 metallurgical coal shipments of 6.9 million tons were 1.3 million tons below the prior year. In the second half of 2009, 5.0 million tons of metallurgical coal were shipped, reflecting a partial recovery from the lower metallurgical coal shipments that occurred in the first half of the year. Trading and Brokerage revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower coal pricing volatility in 2009 resulting in lower margins on trading transactions, partially offset by profit from business contracted in 2008 that was realized in 2009 on an international brokerage arrangement. These decreases to revenues were partially offset by revenue increases in our Midwestern U.S. and Western U.S. Mining segments as discussed below: Midwestern U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.3%) driven by the benefit of higher Illinois Basin prices and increased shipments, including purchased coal used to satisfy certain coal supply agreements. Western U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.2%) due to a combination of higher contract pricing and a shift in sales mix. Revenues were also higher due to increased shipments from our El Segundo Mine (commissioned in June 2008) and customer contract termination and restructuring agreements. These increases were partially offset by the prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million) and an overall volume decrease (5.7%) reflecting our planned Powder River Basin production decreases to match demand. 42 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 721.5 $ 681.3 $ 40.2 5.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 281.9 177.3 104.6 59.0 % Australian Mining 437.8 1,016.6 (578.8 ) (56.9 )% Trading and Brokerage 193.4 218.9 (25.5 ) (11.6 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year due to lower annual export contract pricing and lower sales volume due to reduced demand ($416.0 million) as discussed above. Also impacting the segments Adjusted EBITDA was higher production costs ($170.7 million) driven by increased overburden stripping ratios and decreased longwall mine performance, which included higher costs associated with two additional longwall moves in 2009 compared to 2008. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net revenue discussed above. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher pricing ($205.5 million), partially offset by lower demand ($63.2 million), a prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million), higher sales related costs ($52.0 million) and lower productivity due to increased stripping ratios ($20.8 million). The impact of lower demand was partially mitigated by revenues from customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million). Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year primarily due to higher pricing ($110.7 million) and decreased commodity costs ($16.0 million), partially offset by higher costs associated with mining in more difficult geological conditions compared to the prior year ($20.7 million). Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1) (344.5 ) (247.2 ) (97.3 ) (39.4 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (405.2 ) (402.4 ) (2.8 ) (0.7 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (40.1 ) (48.2 ) 8.1 16.8 % Interest expense (201.2 ) (227.0 ) 25.8 11.4 % Interest income 8.1 10.0 (1.9 ) (19.0 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% 43 Table of Contents (1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from the prior year primarily due to the lower Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above and lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense and asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease of $97.3 million in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the following: Lower results from equity affiliates ($69.1 million) primarily from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela). Carbones del Guasare incurred unfavorable results in 2009 compared to 2008 (our share of which was $25.6 million) due to lower productivity, higher operating costs and ongoing labor issues; in addition, we recognized a $34.7 million impairment loss on this investment. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Lower net gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($49.7 million) was due primarily to a $54.0 million gain in the prior year from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. The above decreases to Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA were offset by lower costs associated with Btu Conversion activities ($16.9 million). Interest expense was lower than the prior year due to lower variable interest rates on our Term Loan Facility and accounts receivable securitization program and lower average borrowings on our Revolver. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates reflecting lower fuel and re vegetation costs incurred in our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% Income tax provision (193.8 ) (191.4 ) (2.4 ) (1.3 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 457.9 987.9 (530.0 ) (53.6 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5.1 (28.8 ) 33.9 117.7 % Net income 463.0 959.1 (496.1 ) (51.7 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14.8 ) (6.2 ) (8.6 ) (138.7 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 448.2 $ 952.9 $ (504.7 ) (53.0 )% 44 Table of Contents Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the strengthening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar ($139.6 million; exchange rate rose 29% in 2009 compared to a 21% decrease in 2008, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.2041 $ (0.1888 ) The prior year release of a foreign valuation allowance related to our Australian net operating loss carry forwards ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. The above increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower pre tax earnings in 2009, which drove a decrease to the income tax provision ($184.6 million). Income from discontinued operations increased compared to the prior year as the prior year included operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine and an $11.7 million write off of a coal excise tax receivable in the first quarter of 2008. In late 2008, legislation was passed which contained provisions that allowed for the refund of coal excise tax collected on certain coal shipments. In 2009, we received a coal excise tax refund resulting in approximately $35 million, net of income taxes, recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund). Partially offsetting the 2009 excise tax refund were operating losses associated with discontinued operations and assets held for sale ($20.6 million) and a $10.0 million loss on the sale of our Chain Valley Mine in Australia. Outlook Near Term Outlook The World Bank estimates global economic activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), expanded 3.9% in 2010. Global GDP is projected to grow another 3.3% in 2011 and 3.6% in 2012, with developing economies, led by China and India, expanding 6% or more in each year, more than twice the growth expected for high income countries. Chinas GDP is projected by the World Bank to grow 10.0% in 2010 and 8.7% in 2011. India, the worlds second fastest growing economy, is projected by the World Bank to grow 9.5% in 2010 and 8.4% in 2011. According to the World Steel Association (WSA), global steel use was expected to increase 13.1% in 2010, followed by another 5.3% in 2011 to a record 1.3 billion tonnes. The WSA forecasts Indias steel demand would rise 8.2% in 2010 and 13.6% in 2011. Similar trends are apparent in steel production. For 2010, global steel production exceeded prior year levels by 15%, led by Asia based production (Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China and India). Industry reports indicate China, the worlds largest steel consumer, is expected to grow its steel use 11% in 2010, and is projected to grow a further 8% to 9% in 2011. Industry reports forecast nearly 85 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation globally were due to come on line during 2010; nearly 80% of which were in China and India. New global coal fueled generation for 2010 is estimated to require approximately 290 million tons of coal annually. For 2011, approximately 90 gigawatts are expected to be under construction and or come online, requiring more than 340 million tons of coal. China and India continue to make up the vast majority. Given the pace of coal demand in the Pacific throughout 2010, coupled with late 2010 weather related demand increases in the Northern Hemisphere and supply constraints in key nations such as Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, South America and Canada, prices for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal 45 Table of Contents have been increasing. High quality, hard coking coal prices have increased from $129 per tonne for annual contracts commencing April 2009, to quarterly (April, July, October 2010) prices ranging between $200 and $225 per tonne, with January 2011 spot price exceeding $350 per tonne. Prompt index prices for Australian seaborne thermal coal rose 34% by year end 2010, and have risen another 10% as of January 18, 2011. Accordingly to the Energy Information Administrations (EIA) Short Term Energy Outlook, 2011 coal consumption, coal production and utility coal stockpiles in the U.S. are projected to be essentially on par with 2010. U.S. growth is projected to resume in 2012, with the increased consumption being matched by higher production, resulting in minimal change to utility coal stockpiles. U.S. natural gas consumption increased 5.5% and production rose approximately 4% in 2010, according to the EIA. Rising supplies combined with persistently high inventory levels have resulted in subdued gas prices. The NYMEX Henry Hub spot price averaged $4.52 per thousand cubic feet in 2010, above 2009s average $4.06 per thousand cubic feet yet 67% below the 2007 2009 average. The EIA also projects that natural gas consumption, production and storage levels will decline slightly in 2011. Like coal, natural gas consumption is expected to grow in 2012, approximately 1.6% to 66.5 billion cubic feet. The projected production decline in 2011 and higher natural gas consumption in 2012 are expected to lead to strengthening natural gas prices. As natural gas prices begin to rise, natural gas production is expected to rebound, growing approximately 2% in 2012. U.S. shale natural gas development continues in the U.S. accounting for approximately 20% of gas supply in 2010 and is estimated by the PIRA Energy Group to grow to over 30% of gas supply over the next several years. This is expected to lead to continued growth in gas fired electricity in the U.S. As of January 25, 2011, we had 7 to 8 million tons of our targeted 2011 metallurgical coal volumes and 6 to 7 million tons of our planned seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in the last three quarters of 2011. For 2012, all of our expected metallurgical coal sales and 12 to 13 million tons of our estimated seaborne thermal coal sales are available to price. In the U.S., we have modest amounts of coal to price in 2011, 35% to 40% in 2012 and 75% to 85% in 2013. We may continue to adjust our production levels in response to change in market demand. We continue to manage costs and operating performance in an effort to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of suboptimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Reductions in the relative cost of other fuels, including natural gas, could impact the use of coal for electricity generation. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. We rely on ongoing access to worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly, many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, bank guarantees, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. Dodd Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Act, which includes a number of provisions applicable to us in the areas of corporate governance, executive compensation and mine safety and extractive industries disclosure. In addition, the Dodd Frank Act imposes additional regulation 46 Table of Contents of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. Although the Dodd Frank Act became generally effective upon its enactment, many provisions have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and require further action by the federal regulatory authorities. As a result, in many respects the ultimate impact of the Dodd Frank Act on us will not be fully known for an extended period of time. We do expect that the Dodd Frank Act will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and Trading and Brokerage activities. Minerals Resource Rent Tax. On May 2, 2010, the Australian government released a report on Australias Future Tax System, which included a recommendation to replace the current resource taxing arrangements imposed on non renewable resources by the Australian federal and state governments with a uniform resource rent tax (the Resource Tax) imposed and administered by the Australian government. As proposed, the Resource Tax would be profit based and would apply to non renewable resources projects, including existing projects. On July 2, 2010, the Australian government announced changes to the Resource Tax and proposed a new minerals resource rent tax (the MRRT). The MRRT would still be profit based, but measures were introduced to lessen the impact of the MRRT. The Australian government and major industry policy makers are actively engaged to work through various structural aspects of the proposed MRRT together with detailed implementation issues. The Committee charged with consulting with industry and preparing recommendations as to the final form of the MRRT submitted its report in late December 2010. The Committees recommendations largely endorse the mining industrys understanding as to what was agreed with the federal government prior to the federal election. The Committees recommendations notwithstanding, it remains to be seen whether the federal government will adopt all recommendations, in particular the recommendation that all state royalties (current and future) are creditable against MRRT payments. MRRT is not yet law in Australia; exposure draft legislation is expected in mid 2011. Following the release of the draft legislation, industry participants will engage in further consultation with the federal government as required. The draft law is expected to be presented to the Australian Parliament in late 2011, and if the MRRT becomes law, it is intended to become effective July 1, 2012. If the MRRT were to become law, it may affect the financial performance of our Australian operations from the effective date forward. Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for the past decade. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates in its World Energy Outlook issued in November 2010, current policies scenario, that world primary energy demand will grow 47% between 2008 and 2035. Demand for coal is projected to rise 59%, outpacing the growth rate of oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro and biomass. China and India alone account for more than 85% of the 2008 2035 coal based primary energy demand growth. Under the current policies scenario, the IEA expects coal to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide. Coals share of the power generation mix was 41% in 2008. By 2035, the IEA estimates coals fuel share to be 43% as it continues to have the largest share of worldwide electric power production. Currently, we estimate approximately 390 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity generating plants are planned or under construction around the world, with expected online dates ranging between 2011 and 2015. When complete, those plants would require an estimated 1.4 billion tons of annual coal demand. In the U.S., while some planned coal based plants have been cancelled, 13 gigawatts of new coal based generating capacity have been completed in 2010 or are under construction with completion dates of 2011 2013, representing approximately 55 million tons of annual coal demand once they become operational. The IEA projects global natural gas fueled electricity generation will have a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%, from 4.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2008 to 8.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2035. The total amount of electricity generated from natural gas is expected to be approximately one half the total for coal, even in 2035. Renewables are projected to comprise 23% of the 2035 fuel mix versus 19% in 2008. Nuclear power is expected to grow 52%, however its share of total generation is expected to fall from 13.5% to 11% between 47 Table of Contents 2008 and 2035. Generation from liquid fuels is projected to decline an average of 2.2% annually to 1.5% of the 2035 generation mix. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as CTG and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. Several CTG and CTL facilities are currently under development in China and India. We continue to support clean coal technology development toward the ultimate goal of near zero emissions, and we are advancing more than a dozen projects and partnerships in the U.S., China and Australia. In addition, clean coal technology development in the U.S. is being accelerated by funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and by the formation of an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the commercial development of five to ten commercial CCS projects by 2016. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of CCS technologies. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions. Along with cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity includes the available balances from our Revolver under the Credit Facility, accounts receivable securitization program and a bank overdraft facility in Australia. Our liquidity is also impacted by activity under certain bilateral cash collateralization arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and our total available liquidity was $2.7 billion. We currently expect that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements during the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future, as described below in Capital Requirements. In addition to the above items, alternative sources of liquidity include the ability to offer and sell certain securities under our shelf registration (as described below). In 2010, we replaced our previous $1.8 billion revolving credit facility with a $1.5 billion Revolver under a new Credit Facility (as described below). Also, additional information on our accounts receivable securitization program and bilateral cash collateralization arrangements can be found in the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements section. Credit Facility. On June 18, 2010, we entered into a Credit Agreement which established a $2.0 billion Credit Facility and replaced our third amended and restated credit agreement dated September 15, 2006. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.5 billion Revolver and a $500.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan). We have the option to request an increase in the capacity of the Credit Facility (but no lender is obligated to increase its commitment to us), provided the aggregate increase for the Revolver and Term Loan does not exceed $250.0 million, the minimum amount of the increase is $25.0 million, and certain other conditions are met under the Credit Agreement. The Revolver also includes a swingline sub facility where up to $50.0 million is available for same day borrowings. The Revolver commitments and the Term Loan under the Credit Facility will mature on June 18, 2015. The Term Loan is subject to quarterly repayment of 1.25% per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, with the final payment of all amounts outstanding (including accrued interest) being due five years from the date of the execution of the Credit Agreement. 48 Table of Contents The Revolver replaced our previous $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and the Term Loan replaced our previous term loan facility (the previous term loan had a balance of $490.3 million at the time of replacement and at December 31, 2009). We recorded $21.9 million in deferred financing costs which are being amortized to interest expense over the five year term of the Credit Facility, and incurred refinancing charges of $9.3 million, which is classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver in 2010 or 2009, or at December 31, 2010. However, we had $67.6 million of outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2010, which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the Revolver by the same amount. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new Credit Facility. Shelf Registration. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires August 7, 2012), at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time: securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Capital Requirements Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, coal reserve lease and royalty payments, debt service costs (interest and principal), lease obligations, take or pay obligations and costs related to past mining obligations. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of certain of our debt instruments. We generally fund our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2011 are anticipated to be $900 to $950 million; including $500 to $550 million earmarked for new mines, expansion and extension projects. Approximately 70% of the growth and expansion capital is targeted for various Australian projects for metallurgical and thermal coal, with the remainder in the U.S. Estimated capital expenditures also include funding for our share of construction costs for Prairie State. Prairie State. We spent $76.0 million during 2010 representing our 5.06% share of the construction costs. Included in Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, are costs of $202.5 million and $126.5 million, respectively. Our share of total construction costs for Prairie State is expected to be approximately $250 million, with most of the remaining funding expected in 2011. GreenGen. During 2010, we spent $3.1 million representing our 6.0% share of the construction costs, which is reflected as capitalized development costs as part of Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. There were no expenditures for GreenGen for 2009. Our share of total construction costs for GreenGen is expected to be approximately $60 million. Dividends. We have declared and paid quarterly dividends since our initial public offering in 2001. In January 2011, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.085 per share of common stock, payable on March 3, 2011. The declaration and payment of dividends and the amount of dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by our debt instruments and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Pension Contributions. During 2010, we made contributions of $112.6 million, which includes our estimate of required contributions for 2011 (based on current assumptions). Share Repurchase Program. At December 31, 2010, our available capacity for share repurchases was $700.4 million, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside of the share repurchase program. While no such share repurchases were made in 2010, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. 49 Table of Contents NCIG. Financing for phase one of stage two of construction closed in 2010 with us providing our pro rata share of funding of $59.7 million Australian dollars ($54.8 million U.S. dollars). NCIG may further expand the coal transloading facilitys capacity which could require us to fund our pro rata share in a similar manner. Senior Notes. On August 25, 2010, we completed a $650.0 million offering of 6.5% 10 year Senior Notes due September 2020 (the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness; equally in right of payment with any senior indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to our future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and effectively junior to all the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2011. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by nearly all of our domestic subsidiaries, as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions. The Notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus a make whole premium and any accrued unpaid interest to the redemption date. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, and cash on hand, to extinguish our previously outstanding $650.0 million aggregate principal 6.875% Senior Notes formerly due in March 2013 (the 2013 Notes). All of the 2013 Notes were either tendered or redeemed in 2010. We recognized debt extinguishment costs of $8.4 million, which are classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The issuance of the Notes and the extinguishment of the 2013 Notes allowed us to lengthen the maturity of our senior indebtedness and lower the coupon rate. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Notes. Total Indebtedness. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, consisted of the following: December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan $ 493.8 $ 490.3 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013 650.0 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2016 218.1 218.1 7.375% Senior Notes due November 2016 650.0 650.0 6.5% Senior Notes due September 2020 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026 247.2 247.1 6.34% Series B Bonds due December 2014 12.0 15.0 6.84% Series C Bonds due December 2016 33.0 33.0 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 373.3 371.5 Capital lease obligations 69.6 67.5 Fair value hedge adjustment 2.2 8.4 Other 0.8 1.4 Total $ 2,750.0 $ 2,752.3 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Facility, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 6.5% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2010. 50 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flows Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Cash Flow 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,087.1 $ 1,050.2 $ 36.9 3.5 % Net cash used in investing activities (703.6 ) (406.5 ) (297.1 ) 73.1 % Net cash used in financing activities (77.1 ) (104.6 ) 27.5 (26.3 )% Operating Activities. The changes from the prior year were driven by the following: Strong operating cash flows generated from our Australian Mining operations driven by higher volumes and pricing; partially offset by Increased margin posted for our derivative trading instruments; Lower utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program in the current year; and Higher pension payments in the current year. Investing Activities. The changes from the prior year were driven by the following: Higher current year capital spending of $296.4 million related primarily to our Bear Run Mine; Current year net cash outflows related to our pro rata share of funding for the NCIG coal transloading facility; and The collection of a note receivable of $30.0 million in the prior year; partially offset by Federal coal lease expenditures of $123.6 million in the prior year. Financing Activities. The increase compared to the prior year was primarily due to the excess tax benefits related to share based compensation of $51.0 million, partially offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $32.2 million in the current year related to our Credit Facility refinancing and the offering of the Notes. The proceeds from long term debt include $500.0 million from the Term Loan and $641.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. These proceeds were used to pay off the $490.3 million balance due on our previous term loan facility and the previously outstanding $650.0 million 2013 Notes. Other Long Term Debt. A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,621.6 $ 213.4 $ 436.6 $ 789.4 $ 4,182.2 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 74.6 17.0 42.1 15.5 Operating lease obligations 455.8 95.6 147.2 106.1 106.9 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 458.2 406.7 51.5 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 62.0 7.2 14.3 10.2 30.3 Take or pay obligations(2) 2,892.9 217.5 465.9 425.7 1,783.8 Other long term liabilities(3) 2,204.1 154.6 301.7 298.7 1,449.1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 11,769.2 $ 1,112.0 $ 1,459.3 $ 1,645.6 $ 7,552.3 51 Table of Contents (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures relate to new mines and expansion and extension projects in Australia and the U.S. (2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal including amounts relating to export facilities. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We do not expect any of the $111.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization program. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. Accounts Receivable Securitization. We have an accounts receivable securitization program (securitization program) through our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary (Seller). Under the securitization program, beginning in 2010, we contribute, on a revolving basis, trade receivables of most of our U.S. subsidiaries to the Seller, which then sells the receivables in their entirety to a consortium of unaffiliated asset backed commercial paper conduits (the Conduits). After the sale, we, as servicer of the assets, collect the receivables on behalf of the Conduits for a nominal servicing fee. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to short term borrowings under our Credit Facility, effectively managing our overall borrowing costs and providing an additional source for working capital. The securitization program was renewed in May 2009 and amended in December 2009 in order to qualify for sale accounting under a newly adopted accounting standard related to financial asset transfers. Prior to amending the securitization program, we sold senior undivided interests in certain of our accounts receivable and retained subordinated interests in those receivables. The current securitization program extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually. The Seller is a separate legal entity whose assets are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Of the receivables sold to the Conduits, a portion of the amount due to the Seller is deferred until the ultimate collection of the underlying receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received total consideration of $4,576.3 million related to accounts receivable sold under the securitization program, including $2,460.1 million of cash up front from the sale of the receivables, an additional $1,953.6 million of cash upon the collection of the underlying receivables, and $162.6 million that had not been collected at December 31, 2010 and was recorded at fair value, which approximates carrying value. The reduction in accounts receivable as a result of securitization activity with the Conduits was $150.0 million at December 31, 2010 and $254.6 million at December 31, 2009. The securitization activity has been reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activity because both the cash received from the Conduits upon sale of receivables as well as the cash received from the Conduits upon the ultimate collection of receivables are not subject to significantly different risks given the short term nature of our trade receivables. We recorded expense associated with securitization 52 Table of Contents transactions of $2.4 million, $4.0 million and $10.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. In 2010, we added standalone credit facilities with multiple banks to allow us to obtain letters of credit and bank guarantees in support of certain operations outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2010, the total capacity under these new facilities, both committed and uncommitted, was approximately $324 million, of which approximately $141 million was utilized (based on the U.S. dollar exchange rate at December 31, 2010). Also during 2010, we entered into a bilateral cash collateralized agreement in support of certain letters of credit whereby we posted cash collateral in lieu of utilizing our Credit Facility. Such cash collateral is classified within cash and cash equivalents given our ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are also required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Postretirement Benefit and Pension Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 for pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $115.6 million, while funding payments were $187.9 million. Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 7.8 $ (6.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 112.5 $ (94.4 ) 53 Table of Contents Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.6 $ (0.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (51.1 ) $ 58.8 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 11.93 years at December 31, 2010. Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $48.5 million, and payments totaled $14.1 million. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ. Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three level hierarchy, Levels 1, 2 and 3. Level 3 fair value measurements are those where inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants. Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include 54 Table of Contents forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 3% and 5%, respectively, of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities in over the counter markets (coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. We perform a VaR analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter and brokerage coal trading. The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical 55 Table of Contents chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not capture the loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR. The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. In 2010, we modified our VaR methodology to be in line with our global trading strategy. The previous methodology used an additive approach whereby the domestic portfolio and the international portfolio were calculated separately and then added together to arrive at our total global VaR. The new methodology explicitly considers correlation measures between the domestic and the international portfolios to consolidate our total global VaR. The high, low and average VaR for the year ended December 31, 2010 is set forth in the table below under the previous and new methodology : Year Ended December 31, 2010 Low High Average (Dollars in millions) Previous Methodology $ 4.5 $ 37.6 $ 10.1 New Methodology $ 3.4 $ 18.8 $ 7.0 As of December 31, 2010, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage of Expiration Portfolio Total 2011 70 % 2012 21 % 2013 3 % 2014 4 % 2015 2 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Nonperformance and Credit Risk Coal Trading. The fair value of our coal trading assets and liabilities reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our exposure is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral (margin), requiring prepayments for shipments or the 56 Table of Contents creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions. Non Coal Trading. The fair value of our non coal trading derivative assets and liabilities also reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. We conduct our hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks and closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. To reduce our credit exposure for these hedging activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.10 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $208 million for 2011. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $60 million for 2011. The table at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2010. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we manage our debt to achieve a certain ratio of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, we had $2.3 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $0.5 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding and had no interest rate swaps in place. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $5 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $163 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. Sales under such agreements comprised approximately 91%, 93% and 90% of our worldwide sales (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Substantially all of our coal in the U.S is contracted in 2011 at planned production levels. We had 13 to 15 million tons remaining to be priced for 2011 in Australia at January 25, 2011. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of cost pass through contracts and derivatives, primarily swaps. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 145 to 150 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2011. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $36 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $14 million. 57 Table of Contents Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 355,000 to 365,000 tons of explosives during 2011 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $6 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $2 million. Notional Amounts and Fair Value. The following summarizes our interest rate, foreign currency and commodity positions at December 31, 2010: Notional Amount by Year of Maturity Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 and thereafter Foreign Currency A$:US$ hedge contracts (A$ millions) $ 4,187.5 $ 1,484.2 $ 1,355.2 $ 926.6 $ 421.5 $ $ Commodity Contracts Diesel fuel hedge contracts (million gallons) 191.4 89.5 76.2 25.7 U.S. explosives hedge contracts (million MMBtu) 8.4 3.9 3.0 1.5 Account Classification by Cash flow Fair value Economic Fair Value Asset hedge hedge hedge (Liability) (Dollars in millions) Foreign Currency A$:US$ hedge contracts (A$ millions) $ 4,187.5 $ $ $ 640.1 Commodity Contracts Diesel fuel hedge contracts (million gallons) 191.4 $ 40.3 U.S. explosives hedge contracts (million MMBtu) 8.4 $ (0.1 ) 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as reflected at the end of Item 6. Selected Financial Data and in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations those operations recently divested, as well as certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets. In October 2006, we acquired Excel Coal Limited (Excel). Our results of operations include Excels results of operations from the date of acquisition. We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 from our audited financial statements. You should read the following table in 34 Table of Contents conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of operations for the historical periods included in the following table are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods. In addition, the Risk Factors section of Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report includes a discussion of risk factors that could impact our future results of operations.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the worlds largest private sector coal company, with majority interests in 28 coal mining operations in the U.S. and Australia. In 2010, we produced 218.4 million tons of coal and sold 245.9 million tons of coal. We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining Segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. In the U.S., we typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). In Australia, our production is sold primarily into the export metallurgical and thermal markets with an increasing number of the contracts negotiated with our customers on a quarterly basis. During 2010, approximately 91% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 84% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 14% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations. Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, as well as the management of our vast coal reserve and real estate holdings. We continue to pursue Btu Conversion projects that expand the uses of coal through CTL and CTG. Our participation in generation development projects involves using our surface lands and coal reserves as the basis for mine mouth plants, such as with our involvement in Prairie State. We are also advancing several initiatives associated with clean coal technologies, including CCS. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, availability of transportation for coal shipments, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the rate of the economic recovery. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our 36 Table of Contents mining costs or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Summary In the U.S., demand for coal rose approximately 75 million tons in 2010, led by a 5.5% increase in coal fueled generation and an 18 million ton rise in exports. The international coal markets strengthened in 2010 due to strong Asian demand growth and weather related generation recovery in the Atlantic markets, coupled with supply challenges across the major coal exporting nations of the Southern Hemisphere. Our analyses of general business conditions indicate the following: Seaborne coal demand increased an estimated 13% in 2010, led by a 32% recovery in global metallurgical coal demand; Pacific thermal coal demand for electricity generation rose 15% in 2010, while the Atlantic market declined 10%; Benchmark pricing of high quality, hard coking coal in the seaborne market has ranged between $200 to $225 per tonne since April 2010; The benchmark prompt seaborne thermal coal price in Newcastle, Australia rose 34% in 2010; U.S. coal generation accounted for nearly two thirds of the growth in total power output in 2010 due to new coal fueled generation, favorable weather, and a partial reversal of 2009s coal to gas switching; and Indexed U.S. coal prices rose in 2010 in all regions, with increases ranging from 30 to 50%. Our revenues increased compared to the prior year by $847.6 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year by $535.2 million, led by higher Australian pricing and sales volumes in the current year despite unfavorable weather related volume impacts that occurred late in 2010. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to the prior year by $347.2 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by increased income taxes, decreased Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and interest expense. We ended the year with total available liquidity of $2.7 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 163.8 160.1 3.7 2.3 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 29.7 31.8 (2.1 ) (6.6 )% Australian Mining 27.0 22.3 4.7 21.1 % Trading and Brokerage 25.4 29.4 (4.0 ) (13.6 )% Total tons sold 245.9 243.6 2.3 0.9 % 37 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,706.3 $ 2,612.6 $ 93.7 3.6 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,320.6 1,303.8 16.8 1.3 % Australian Mining 2,520.0 1,678.0 842.0 50.2 % Trading and Brokerage 291.1 391.0 (99.9 ) (25.5 )% Corporate and Other 22.0 27.0 (5.0 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,860.0 $ 6,012.4 $ 847.6 14.1 % The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 23.9%, led by increased pricing on seaborne metallurgical and thermal coals and a higher mix of metallurgical coal shipments. Volumes also increased in the current year (21.1%) driven by increased demand for metallurgical coal (metallurgical coal shipments of 9.8 million tons were 2.9 million tons, or 42%, greater than the prior year). These increases were muted to an extent by the flooding in Queensland in late 2010 that negatively impacted our production and also restricted throughput due to damage to the port and rail systems. The metallurgical coal demand increase reflects the strengthening of the coal markets as discussed above, coupled with prior year customer destocking of inventory and lower capacity utilization at steel customers. Western U.S. Mining operations revenues increased compared to the prior year due to increased sales volume (2.3%) driven by our Powder River Basin and Southwest regions due to increased customer demand and a higher weighted average sales price of 1.3%. In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements due to an increase in our weighted average sales price of 8.4% from contractual price increases were largely offset by decreased shipments (6.6%) on lower customer demand. Trading and Brokerage revenues were down primarily due to lower international brokerage revenues, unfavorable market movements on freight positions that support our export volumes and weather related shipment deferrals. Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 816.7 $ 721.5 $ 95.2 13.2 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 322.1 281.9 40.2 14.3 % Australian Mining 953.8 437.8 516.0 117.9 % Trading and Brokerage 77.2 193.4 (116.2 ) (60.1 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,169.8 $ 1,634.6 $ 535.2 32.7 % Our Australian Mining segment benefitted from a higher weighted average sales price ($413.0 million) and increased volumes ($127.9 million) as discussed above, and productivity improvements at our North Goonyella and Wambo underground mines along with fewer longwall move days in the current year ($116.0 million). Partially offsetting the above improvements were net higher adverse weather impacts 38 Table of Contents ($47.0 million) driven by the flooding in late 2010, unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($34.5 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced metallurgical coal shipments ($31.7 million) and increased demurrage costs ($10.7 million). Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to the higher volumes ($49.8 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($42.1 million) discussed above, lower repairs and maintenance costs due to timing of repairs and improved equipment efficiency ($35.0 million) and fewer longwall move days at our Twentymile Mine in the current year ($10.0 million), partially offset by prior year customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million) and increased commodity costs in the current year ($20.8 million). In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, a higher weighted average sales price ($98.5 million), as discussed above, was partially offset by lower volumes ($42.3 million) due to decreased demand and increased costs on lower productivity due to compliance measures and geological conditions at certain underground mines. Our Trading and Brokerage segment was down primarily due to the lower revenues as discussed above. Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,169.8 $ 1,634.6 $ 535.2 32.7 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1) (354.7 ) (344.5 ) (10.2 ) (3.0 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (440.9 ) (405.2 ) (35.7 ) (8.8 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.5 ) (40.1 ) (8.4 ) (20.9 )% Interest expense (222.1 ) (201.2 ) (20.9 ) (10.4 )% Interest income 9.6 8.1 1.5 18.5 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,113.2 $ 651.7 $ 461.5 70.8 % (1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was higher compared to the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense as discussed below: Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA: higher expense was primarily driven by a current year increase in selling and administrative expenses due to costs to support our business development and international expansion (e.g. headcount, travel, professional services, legal). We also incurred increased post mining costs driven by higher retiree healthcare amortization of actuarial losses and interest cost. These items were partially offset by improved results from equity affiliates primarily due to prior year losses of $54.6 million related to our equity investment in Carbones del Guasare, which included a $34.7 million impairment loss and $19.9 million of operating losses. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 39 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization: higher compared to the prior year due to increased production at our Australian mines with higher per ton depletion rates reflecting higher demand and additional depreciation expense associated with our new Bear Run Mine (commissioned in the second quarter of 2010). Interest expense: higher primarily due to refinancing charges ($9.3 million) associated with our new five year Credit Facility and charges ($8.4 million) associated with the extinguishment and refinancing of $650.0 million of senior notes. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,113.2 $ 651.7 $ 461.5 70.8 % Income tax provision (308.1 ) (193.8 ) (114.3 ) (59.0 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 805.1 457.9 347.2 75.8 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (2.9 ) 5.1 (8.0 ) 156.9 % Net income 802.2 463.0 339.2 73.3 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (28.2 ) (14.8 ) (13.4 ) (90.5 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 774.0 $ 448.2 $ 325.8 72.7 % Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to the prior year due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense due to higher current year earnings ($161.5 million) and current year income tax resulting from foreign earnings repatriation ($84.5 million), partially offset by A change in the valuation allowance ($46.4 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits, lower expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the larger increase in the Australian exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in the prior year compared to the current year ($26.8 million) as set forth in the table below, the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in the current year ($42.5 million), and lower expense in the current year due to the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination of the 2005 federal income tax year ($15.2 million). December 31, Rate Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 1.0163 $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.1194 $ 0.2041 Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2010 reflects a loss of $2.9 million as compared to income of $5.1 million in 2009 due primarily to a coal excise tax refund receivable of approximately $35 million recorded in 2009, partially offset by operating losses and loss on disposal of our Australian Chain Valley Mine in 2009. 40 Table of Contents Other The fair value of our foreign currency hedges increased approximately $434 million in 2010 mostly due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar in the current year. The increase is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Summary Our overall results for 2009 compared to 2008 reflect the unfavorable impact of lower global demand for coal as a result of the global economic recession. Despite the recession, our 2009 Adjusted EBITDA was the third highest in our 127 year history, only trailing 2008 and 2010. We also ended 2009 with total available liquidity of $2.5 billion. We continued to focus on strong cost control and productivity improvements, increased contributions from our high margin operations and exercising tight capital discipline. Our 2009 tons sold were below prior year levels reflecting planned production reductions in the Powder River Basin to match lower demand, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the full year operation of our El Segundo Mine in the Southwest. In the U.S., the decreased demand from lower industrial output, lower natural gas prices that resulted in higher fuel switching and higher coal stockpiles in the U.S. led to an 8.5 million ton decline in sales volume. In Australia, lower demand from steel customers resulted in a 1.3 million ton decline in metallurgical coal volume, although volumes in the second half of 2009 began to increase on an improved economic outlook led by demand from Asian Pacific markets. Our 2009 revenues declined compared to 2008 and were primarily impacted by Australias lower annual export contract pricing that commenced on April 1, 2009 as compared to 2008s record pricing and the overall decline in volume. Lower revenues were also driven by the decline in Trading and Brokerage revenues that resulted from lower coal pricing volatility. The lower Australian and Trading and Brokerage revenues were partially offset by an increase in U.S. revenues per ton that reflect multi year contracts signed at higher prices in recent years. While our Segment Adjusted EBITDA reflects the lower revenue discussed above, our 2009 margins also reflect the impact of producing at reduced levels as well as higher sales related costs. In addition, our costs in Australia were higher due to two additional longwall moves compared to 2008 and the impact of mining in difficult geologic conditions that also included higher costs for overburden removal. Net income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the above items, as well as lower results from equity affiliates and decreased net gains on disposals of assets. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $457.9 million in 2009, or $1.64 per diluted share, 53.6% below 2008 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $987.9 million, or $3.60 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 160.1 169.7 (9.6 ) (5.7 )% Midwestern U.S. Mining 31.8 30.7 1.1 3.6 % Australian Mining 22.3 23.4 (1.1 ) (4.7 )% Trading and Brokerage 29.4 31.2 (1.8 ) (5.8 )% Total tons sold 243.6 255.0 (11.4 ) (4.5 )% 41 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,612.6 $ 2,533.1 $ 79.5 3.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,303.8 1,154.6 149.2 12.9 % Australian Mining 1,678.0 2,242.8 (564.8 ) (25.2 )% Trading and Brokerage 391.0 601.8 (210.8 ) (35.0 )% Corporate and Other 27.0 28.7 (1.7 ) (5.9 )% Total revenues $ 6,012.4 $ 6,561.0 $ (548.6 ) (8.4 )% 2009 revenues were below the prior year driven by decreases in our Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage segments as discussed below: Australian Mining operations average sales price decreased 21.4% from the prior year reflecting the lower annual export contract pricing that commenced April 1, 2009 compared to the record pricing realized in 2008. The price decreases were combined with volume decreases from the prior year (4.7%) due to overall lower demand experienced in the first half of 2009. 2009 metallurgical coal shipments of 6.9 million tons were 1.3 million tons below the prior year. In the second half of 2009, 5.0 million tons of metallurgical coal were shipped, reflecting a partial recovery from the lower metallurgical coal shipments that occurred in the first half of the year. Trading and Brokerage revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower coal pricing volatility in 2009 resulting in lower margins on trading transactions, partially offset by profit from business contracted in 2008 that was realized in 2009 on an international brokerage arrangement. These decreases to revenues were partially offset by revenue increases in our Midwestern U.S. and Western U.S. Mining segments as discussed below: Midwestern U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.3%) driven by the benefit of higher Illinois Basin prices and increased shipments, including purchased coal used to satisfy certain coal supply agreements. Western U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.2%) due to a combination of higher contract pricing and a shift in sales mix. Revenues were also higher due to increased shipments from our El Segundo Mine (commissioned in June 2008) and customer contract termination and restructuring agreements. These increases were partially offset by the prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million) and an overall volume decrease (5.7%) reflecting our planned Powder River Basin production decreases to match demand. 42 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 721.5 $ 681.3 $ 40.2 5.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 281.9 177.3 104.6 59.0 % Australian Mining 437.8 1,016.6 (578.8 ) (56.9 )% Trading and Brokerage 193.4 218.9 (25.5 ) (11.6 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year due to lower annual export contract pricing and lower sales volume due to reduced demand ($416.0 million) as discussed above. Also impacting the segments Adjusted EBITDA was higher production costs ($170.7 million) driven by increased overburden stripping ratios and decreased longwall mine performance, which included higher costs associated with two additional longwall moves in 2009 compared to 2008. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net revenue discussed above. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher pricing ($205.5 million), partially offset by lower demand ($63.2 million), a prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million), higher sales related costs ($52.0 million) and lower productivity due to increased stripping ratios ($20.8 million). The impact of lower demand was partially mitigated by revenues from customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million). Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year primarily due to higher pricing ($110.7 million) and decreased commodity costs ($16.0 million), partially offset by higher costs associated with mining in more difficult geological conditions compared to the prior year ($20.7 million). Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1) (344.5 ) (247.2 ) (97.3 ) (39.4 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (405.2 ) (402.4 ) (2.8 ) (0.7 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (40.1 ) (48.2 ) 8.1 16.8 % Interest expense (201.2 ) (227.0 ) 25.8 11.4 % Interest income 8.1 10.0 (1.9 ) (19.0 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% 43 Table of Contents (1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from the prior year primarily due to the lower Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above and lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense and asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease of $97.3 million in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the following: Lower results from equity affiliates ($69.1 million) primarily from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela). Carbones del Guasare incurred unfavorable results in 2009 compared to 2008 (our share of which was $25.6 million) due to lower productivity, higher operating costs and ongoing labor issues; in addition, we recognized a $34.7 million impairment loss on this investment. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Lower net gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($49.7 million) was due primarily to a $54.0 million gain in the prior year from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. The above decreases to Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA were offset by lower costs associated with Btu Conversion activities ($16.9 million). Interest expense was lower than the prior year due to lower variable interest rates on our Term Loan Facility and accounts receivable securitization program and lower average borrowings on our Revolver. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates reflecting lower fuel and re vegetation costs incurred in our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% Income tax provision (193.8 ) (191.4 ) (2.4 ) (1.3 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 457.9 987.9 (530.0 ) (53.6 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5.1 (28.8 ) 33.9 117.7 % Net income 463.0 959.1 (496.1 ) (51.7 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14.8 ) (6.2 ) (8.6 ) (138.7 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 448.2 $ 952.9 $ (504.7 ) (53.0 )% 44 Table of Contents Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the strengthening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar ($139.6 million; exchange rate rose 29% in 2009 compared to a 21% decrease in 2008, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.2041 $ (0.1888 ) The prior year release of a foreign valuation allowance related to our Australian net operating loss carry forwards ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. The above increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower pre tax earnings in 2009, which drove a decrease to the income tax provision ($184.6 million). Income from discontinued operations increased compared to the prior year as the prior year included operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine and an $11.7 million write off of a coal excise tax receivable in the first quarter of 2008. In late 2008, legislation was passed which contained provisions that allowed for the refund of coal excise tax collected on certain coal shipments. In 2009, we received a coal excise tax refund resulting in approximately $35 million, net of income taxes, recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund). Partially offsetting the 2009 excise tax refund were operating losses associated with discontinued operations and assets held for sale ($20.6 million) and a $10.0 million loss on the sale of our Chain Valley Mine in Australia. Outlook Near Term Outlook The World Bank estimates global economic activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), expanded 3.9% in 2010. Global GDP is projected to grow another 3.3% in 2011 and 3.6% in 2012, with developing economies, led by China and India, expanding 6% or more in each year, more than twice the growth expected for high income countries. Chinas GDP is projected by the World Bank to grow 10.0% in 2010 and 8.7% in 2011. India, the worlds second fastest growing economy, is projected by the World Bank to grow 9.5% in 2010 and 8.4% in 2011. According to the World Steel Association (WSA), global steel use was expected to increase 13.1% in 2010, followed by another 5.3% in 2011 to a record 1.3 billion tonnes. The WSA forecasts Indias steel demand would rise 8.2% in 2010 and 13.6% in 2011. Similar trends are apparent in steel production. For 2010, global steel production exceeded prior year levels by 15%, led by Asia based production (Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China and India). Industry reports indicate China, the worlds largest steel consumer, is expected to grow its steel use 11% in 2010, and is projected to grow a further 8% to 9% in 2011. Industry reports forecast nearly 85 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation globally were due to come on line during 2010; nearly 80% of which were in China and India. New global coal fueled generation for 2010 is estimated to require approximately 290 million tons of coal annually. For 2011, approximately 90 gigawatts are expected to be under construction and or come online, requiring more than 340 million tons of coal. China and India continue to make up the vast majority. Given the pace of coal demand in the Pacific throughout 2010, coupled with late 2010 weather related demand increases in the Northern Hemisphere and supply constraints in key nations such as Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, South America and Canada, prices for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal 45 Table of Contents have been increasing. High quality, hard coking coal prices have increased from $129 per tonne for annual contracts commencing April 2009, to quarterly (April, July, October 2010) prices ranging between $200 and $225 per tonne, with January 2011 spot price exceeding $350 per tonne. Prompt index prices for Australian seaborne thermal coal rose 34% by year end 2010, and have risen another 10% as of January 18, 2011. Accordingly to the Energy Information Administrations (EIA) Short Term Energy Outlook, 2011 coal consumption, coal production and utility coal stockpiles in the U.S. are projected to be essentially on par with 2010. U.S. growth is projected to resume in 2012, with the increased consumption being matched by higher production, resulting in minimal change to utility coal stockpiles. U.S. natural gas consumption increased 5.5% and production rose approximately 4% in 2010, according to the EIA. Rising supplies combined with persistently high inventory levels have resulted in subdued gas prices. The NYMEX Henry Hub spot price averaged $4.52 per thousand cubic feet in 2010, above 2009s average $4.06 per thousand cubic feet yet 67% below the 2007 2009 average. The EIA also projects that natural gas consumption, production and storage levels will decline slightly in 2011. Like coal, natural gas consumption is expected to grow in 2012, approximately 1.6% to 66.5 billion cubic feet. The projected production decline in 2011 and higher natural gas consumption in 2012 are expected to lead to strengthening natural gas prices. As natural gas prices begin to rise, natural gas production is expected to rebound, growing approximately 2% in 2012. U.S. shale natural gas development continues in the U.S. accounting for approximately 20% of gas supply in 2010 and is estimated by the PIRA Energy Group to grow to over 30% of gas supply over the next several years. This is expected to lead to continued growth in gas fired electricity in the U.S. As of January 25, 2011, we had 7 to 8 million tons of our targeted 2011 metallurgical coal volumes and 6 to 7 million tons of our planned seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in the last three quarters of 2011. For 2012, all of our expected metallurgical coal sales and 12 to 13 million tons of our estimated seaborne thermal coal sales are available to price. In the U.S., we have modest amounts of coal to price in 2011, 35% to 40% in 2012 and 75% to 85% in 2013. We may continue to adjust our production levels in response to change in market demand. We continue to manage costs and operating performance in an effort to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of suboptimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Reductions in the relative cost of other fuels, including natural gas, could impact the use of coal for electricity generation. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. We rely on ongoing access to worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly, many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, bank guarantees, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. Dodd Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Act, which includes a number of provisions applicable to us in the areas of corporate governance, executive compensation and mine safety and extractive industries disclosure. In addition, the Dodd Frank Act imposes additional regulation 46 Table of Contents of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. Although the Dodd Frank Act became generally effective upon its enactment, many provisions have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and require further action by the federal regulatory authorities. As a result, in many respects the ultimate impact of the Dodd Frank Act on us will not be fully known for an extended period of time. We do expect that the Dodd Frank Act will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and Trading and Brokerage activities. Minerals Resource Rent Tax. On May 2, 2010, the Australian government released a report on Australias Future Tax System, which included a recommendation to replace the current resource taxing arrangements imposed on non renewable resources by the Australian federal and state governments with a uniform resource rent tax (the Resource Tax) imposed and administered by the Australian government. As proposed, the Resource Tax would be profit based and would apply to non renewable resources projects, including existing projects. On July 2, 2010, the Australian government announced changes to the Resource Tax and proposed a new minerals resource rent tax (the MRRT). The MRRT would still be profit based, but measures were introduced to lessen the impact of the MRRT. The Australian government and major industry policy makers are actively engaged to work through various structural aspects of the proposed MRRT together with detailed implementation issues. The Committee charged with consulting with industry and preparing recommendations as to the final form of the MRRT submitted its report in late December 2010. The Committees recommendations largely endorse the mining industrys understanding as to what was agreed with the federal government prior to the federal election. The Committees recommendations notwithstanding, it remains to be seen whether the federal government will adopt all recommendations, in particular the recommendation that all state royalties (current and future) are creditable against MRRT payments. MRRT is not yet law in Australia; exposure draft legislation is expected in mid 2011. Following the release of the draft legislation, industry participants will engage in further consultation with the federal government as required. The draft law is expected to be presented to the Australian Parliament in late 2011, and if the MRRT becomes law, it is intended to become effective July 1, 2012. If the MRRT were to become law, it may affect the financial performance of our Australian operations from the effective date forward. Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for the past decade. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates in its World Energy Outlook issued in November 2010, current policies scenario, that world primary energy demand will grow 47% between 2008 and 2035. Demand for coal is projected to rise 59%, outpacing the growth rate of oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro and biomass. China and India alone account for more than 85% of the 2008 2035 coal based primary energy demand growth. Under the current policies scenario, the IEA expects coal to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide. Coals share of the power generation mix was 41% in 2008. By 2035, the IEA estimates coals fuel share to be 43% as it continues to have the largest share of worldwide electric power production. Currently, we estimate approximately 390 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity generating plants are planned or under construction around the world, with expected online dates ranging between 2011 and 2015. When complete, those plants would require an estimated 1.4 billion tons of annual coal demand. In the U.S., while some planned coal based plants have been cancelled, 13 gigawatts of new coal based generating capacity have been completed in 2010 or are under construction with completion dates of 2011 2013, representing approximately 55 million tons of annual coal demand once they become operational. The IEA projects global natural gas fueled electricity generation will have a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%, from 4.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2008 to 8.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2035. The total amount of electricity generated from natural gas is expected to be approximately one half the total for coal, even in 2035. Renewables are projected to comprise 23% of the 2035 fuel mix versus 19% in 2008. Nuclear power is expected to grow 52%, however its share of total generation is expected to fall from 13.5% to 11% between 47 Table of Contents 2008 and 2035. Generation from liquid fuels is projected to decline an average of 2.2% annually to 1.5% of the 2035 generation mix. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as CTG and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. Several CTG and CTL facilities are currently under development in China and India. We continue to support clean coal technology development toward the ultimate goal of near zero emissions, and we are advancing more than a dozen projects and partnerships in the U.S., China and Australia. In addition, clean coal technology development in the U.S. is being accelerated by funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and by the formation of an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the commercial development of five to ten commercial CCS projects by 2016. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of CCS technologies. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions. Along with cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity includes the available balances from our Revolver under the Credit Facility, accounts receivable securitization program and a bank overdraft facility in Australia. Our liquidity is also impacted by activity under certain bilateral cash collateralization arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and our total available liquidity was $2.7 billion. We currently expect that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements during the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future, as described below in Capital Requirements. In addition to the above items, alternative sources of liquidity include the ability to offer and sell certain securities under our shelf registration (as described below). In 2010, we replaced our previous $1.8 billion revolving credit facility with a $1.5 billion Revolver under a new Credit Facility (as described below). Also, additional information on our accounts receivable securitization program and bilateral cash collateralization arrangements can be found in the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements section. Credit Facility. On June 18, 2010, we entered into a Credit Agreement which established a $2.0 billion Credit Facility and replaced our third amended and restated credit agreement dated September 15, 2006. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.5 billion Revolver and a $500.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan). We have the option to request an increase in the capacity of the Credit Facility (but no lender is obligated to increase its commitment to us), provided the aggregate increase for the Revolver and Term Loan does not exceed $250.0 million, the minimum amount of the increase is $25.0 million, and certain other conditions are met under the Credit Agreement. The Revolver also includes a swingline sub facility where up to $50.0 million is available for same day borrowings. The Revolver commitments and the Term Loan under the Credit Facility will mature on June 18, 2015. The Term Loan is subject to quarterly repayment of 1.25% per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, with the final payment of all amounts outstanding (including accrued interest) being due five years from the date of the execution of the Credit Agreement. 48 Table of Contents The Revolver replaced our previous $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and the Term Loan replaced our previous term loan facility (the previous term loan had a balance of $490.3 million at the time of replacement and at December 31, 2009). We recorded $21.9 million in deferred financing costs which are being amortized to interest expense over the five year term of the Credit Facility, and incurred refinancing charges of $9.3 million, which is classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver in 2010 or 2009, or at December 31, 2010. However, we had $67.6 million of outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2010, which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the Revolver by the same amount. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new Credit Facility. Shelf Registration. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires August 7, 2012), at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time: securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Capital Requirements Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, coal reserve lease and royalty payments, debt service costs (interest and principal), lease obligations, take or pay obligations and costs related to past mining obligations. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of certain of our debt instruments. We generally fund our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2011 are anticipated to be $900 to $950 million; including $500 to $550 million earmarked for new mines, expansion and extension projects. Approximately 70% of the growth and expansion capital is targeted for various Australian projects for metallurgical and thermal coal, with the remainder in the U.S. Estimated capital expenditures also include funding for our share of construction costs for Prairie State. Prairie State. We spent $76.0 million during 2010 representing our 5.06% share of the construction costs. Included in Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, are costs of $202.5 million and $126.5 million, respectively. Our share of total construction costs for Prairie State is expected to be approximately $250 million, with most of the remaining funding expected in 2011. GreenGen. During 2010, we spent $3.1 million representing our 6.0% share of the construction costs, which is reflected as capitalized development costs as part of Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. There were no expenditures for GreenGen for 2009. Our share of total construction costs for GreenGen is expected to be approximately $60 million. Dividends. We have declared and paid quarterly dividends since our initial public offering in 2001. In January 2011, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.085 per share of common stock, payable on March 3, 2011. The declaration and payment of dividends and the amount of dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by our debt instruments and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Pension Contributions. During 2010, we made contributions of $112.6 million, which includes our estimate of required contributions for 2011 (based on current assumptions). Share Repurchase Program. At December 31, 2010, our available capacity for share repurchases was $700.4 million, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside of the share repurchase program. While no such share repurchases were made in 2010, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. 49 Table of Contents NCIG. Financing for phase one of stage two of construction closed in 2010 with us providing our pro rata share of funding of $59.7 million Australian dollars ($54.8 million U.S. dollars). NCIG may further expand the coal transloading facilitys capacity which could require us to fund our pro rata share in a similar manner. Senior Notes. On August 25, 2010, we completed a $650.0 million offering of 6.5% 10 year Senior Notes due September 2020 (the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness; equally in right of payment with any senior indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to our future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and effectively junior to all the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2011. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by nearly all of our domestic subsidiaries, as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions. The Notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus a make whole premium and any accrued unpaid interest to the redemption date. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, and cash on hand, to extinguish our previously outstanding $650.0 million aggregate principal 6.875% Senior Notes formerly due in March 2013 (the 2013 Notes). All of the 2013 Notes were either tendered or redeemed in 2010. We recognized debt extinguishment costs of $8.4 million, which are classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The issuance of the Notes and the extinguishment of the 2013 Notes allowed us to lengthen the maturity of our senior indebtedness and lower the coupon rate. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Notes. Total Indebtedness. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, consisted of the following: December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan $ 493.8 $ 490.3 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013 650.0 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2016 218.1 218.1 7.375% Senior Notes due November 2016 650.0 650.0 6.5% Senior Notes due September 2020 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026 247.2 247.1 6.34% Series B Bonds due December 2014 12.0 15.0 6.84% Series C Bonds due December 2016 33.0 33.0 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 373.3 371.5 Capital lease obligations 69.6 67.5 Fair value hedge adjustment 2.2 8.4 Other 0.8 1.4 Total $ 2,750.0 $ 2,752.3 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Facility, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 6.5% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2010. 50 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flows Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Cash Flow 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,087.1 $ 1,050.2 $ 36.9 3.5 % Net cash used in investing activities (703.6 ) (406.5 ) (297.1 ) 73.1 % Net cash used in financing activities (77.1 ) (104.6 ) 27.5 (26.3 )% Operating Activities. The changes from the prior year were driven by the following: Strong operating cash flows generated from our Australian Mining operations driven by higher volumes and pricing; partially offset by Increased margin posted for our derivative trading instruments; Lower utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program in the current year; and Higher pension payments in the current year. Investing Activities. The changes from the prior year were driven by the following: Higher current year capital spending of $296.4 million related primarily to our Bear Run Mine; Current year net cash outflows related to our pro rata share of funding for the NCIG coal transloading facility; and The collection of a note receivable of $30.0 million in the prior year; partially offset by Federal coal lease expenditures of $123.6 million in the prior year. Financing Activities. The increase compared to the prior year was primarily due to the excess tax benefits related to share based compensation of $51.0 million, partially offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $32.2 million in the current year related to our Credit Facility refinancing and the offering of the Notes. The proceeds from long term debt include $500.0 million from the Term Loan and $641.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. These proceeds were used to pay off the $490.3 million balance due on our previous term loan facility and the previously outstanding $650.0 million 2013 Notes. Other Long Term Debt. A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,621.6 $ 213.4 $ 436.6 $ 789.4 $ 4,182.2 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 74.6 17.0 42.1 15.5 Operating lease obligations 455.8 95.6 147.2 106.1 106.9 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 458.2 406.7 51.5 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 62.0 7.2 14.3 10.2 30.3 Take or pay obligations(2) 2,892.9 217.5 465.9 425.7 1,783.8 Other long term liabilities(3) 2,204.1 154.6 301.7 298.7 1,449.1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 11,769.2 $ 1,112.0 $ 1,459.3 $ 1,645.6 $ 7,552.3 51 Table of Contents (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures relate to new mines and expansion and extension projects in Australia and the U.S. (2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal including amounts relating to export facilities. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We do not expect any of the $111.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization program. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. Accounts Receivable Securitization. We have an accounts receivable securitization program (securitization program) through our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary (Seller). Under the securitization program, beginning in 2010, we contribute, on a revolving basis, trade receivables of most of our U.S. subsidiaries to the Seller, which then sells the receivables in their entirety to a consortium of unaffiliated asset backed commercial paper conduits (the Conduits). After the sale, we, as servicer of the assets, collect the receivables on behalf of the Conduits for a nominal servicing fee. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to short term borrowings under our Credit Facility, effectively managing our overall borrowing costs and providing an additional source for working capital. The securitization program was renewed in May 2009 and amended in December 2009 in order to qualify for sale accounting under a newly adopted accounting standard related to financial asset transfers. Prior to amending the securitization program, we sold senior undivided interests in certain of our accounts receivable and retained subordinated interests in those receivables. The current securitization program extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually. The Seller is a separate legal entity whose assets are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Of the receivables sold to the Conduits, a portion of the amount due to the Seller is deferred until the ultimate collection of the underlying receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received total consideration of $4,576.3 million related to accounts receivable sold under the securitization program, including $2,460.1 million of cash up front from the sale of the receivables, an additional $1,953.6 million of cash upon the collection of the underlying receivables, and $162.6 million that had not been collected at December 31, 2010 and was recorded at fair value, which approximates carrying value. The reduction in accounts receivable as a result of securitization activity with the Conduits was $150.0 million at December 31, 2010 and $254.6 million at December 31, 2009. The securitization activity has been reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activity because both the cash received from the Conduits upon sale of receivables as well as the cash received from the Conduits upon the ultimate collection of receivables are not subject to significantly different risks given the short term nature of our trade receivables. We recorded expense associated with securitization 52 Table of Contents transactions of $2.4 million, $4.0 million and $10.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. In 2010, we added standalone credit facilities with multiple banks to allow us to obtain letters of credit and bank guarantees in support of certain operations outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2010, the total capacity under these new facilities, both committed and uncommitted, was approximately $324 million, of which approximately $141 million was utilized (based on the U.S. dollar exchange rate at December 31, 2010). Also during 2010, we entered into a bilateral cash collateralized agreement in support of certain letters of credit whereby we posted cash collateral in lieu of utilizing our Credit Facility. Such cash collateral is classified within cash and cash equivalents given our ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are also required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Postretirement Benefit and Pension Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 for pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $115.6 million, while funding payments were $187.9 million. Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 7.8 $ (6.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 112.5 $ (94.4 ) 53 Table of Contents Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.6 $ (0.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (51.1 ) $ 58.8 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 11.93 years at December 31, 2010. Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $48.5 million, and payments totaled $14.1 million. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ. Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three level hierarchy, Levels 1, 2 and 3. Level 3 fair value measurements are those where inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants. Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include 54 Table of Contents forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 3% and 5%, respectively, of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities in over the counter markets (coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. We perform a VaR analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter and brokerage coal trading. The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical 55 Table of Contents chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not capture the loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR. The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. In 2010, we modified our VaR methodology to be in line with our global trading strategy. The previous methodology used an additive approach whereby the domestic portfolio and the international portfolio were calculated separately and then added together to arrive at our total global VaR. The new methodology explicitly considers correlation measures between the domestic and the international portfolios to consolidate our total global VaR. The high, low and average VaR for the year ended December 31, 2010 is set forth in the table below under the previous and new methodology : Year Ended December 31, 2010 Low High Average (Dollars in millions) Previous Methodology $ 4.5 $ 37.6 $ 10.1 New Methodology $ 3.4 $ 18.8 $ 7.0 As of December 31, 2010, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage of Expiration Portfolio Total 2011 70 % 2012 21 % 2013 3 % 2014 4 % 2015 2 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Nonperformance and Credit Risk Coal Trading. The fair value of our coal trading assets and liabilities reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our exposure is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral (margin), requiring prepayments for shipments or the 56 Table of Contents creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions. Non Coal Trading. The fair value of our non coal trading derivative assets and liabilities also reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. We conduct our hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks and closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. To reduce our credit exposure for these hedging activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.10 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $208 million for 2011. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $60 million for 2011. The table at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2010. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we manage our debt to achieve a certain ratio of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, we had $2.3 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $0.5 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding and had no interest rate swaps in place. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $5 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $163 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. Sales under such agreements comprised approximately 91%, 93% and 90% of our worldwide sales (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Substantially all of our coal in the U.S is contracted in 2011 at planned production levels. We had 13 to 15 million tons remaining to be priced for 2011 in Australia at January 25, 2011. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of cost pass through contracts and derivatives, primarily swaps. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 145 to 150 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2011. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $36 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $14 million. 57 Table of Contents Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 355,000 to 365,000 tons of explosives during 2011 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $6 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $2 million. Notional Amounts and Fair Value. The following summarizes our interest rate, foreign currency and commodity positions at December 31, 2010: Notional Amount by Year of Maturity Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 and thereafter Foreign Currency A$:US$ hedge contracts (A$ millions) $ 4,187.5 $ 1,484.2 $ 1,355.2 $ 926.6 $ 421.5 $ $ Commodity Contracts Diesel fuel hedge contracts (million gallons) 191.4 89.5 76.2 25.7 U.S. explosives hedge contracts (million MMBtu) 8.4 3.9 3.0 1.5 Account Classification by Cash flow Fair value Economic Fair Value Asset hedge hedge hedge (Liability) (Dollars in millions) Foreign Currency A$:US$ hedge contracts (A$ millions) $ 4,187.5 $ $ $ 640.1 Commodity Contracts Diesel fuel hedge contracts (million gallons) 191.4 $ 40.3 U.S. explosives hedge contracts (million MMBtu) 8.4 $ (0.1 )

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the worlds largest private sector coal company, with majority interests in 28 coal mining operations in the U.S. and Australia. In 2010, we produced 218.4 million tons of coal and sold 245.9 million tons of coal. We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining Segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. In the U.S., we typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). In Australia, our production is sold primarily into the export metallurgical and thermal markets with an increasing number of the contracts negotiated with our customers on a quarterly basis. During 2010, approximately 91% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 84% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 14% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations. Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, as well as the management of our vast coal reserve and real estate holdings. We continue to pursue Btu Conversion projects that expand the uses of coal through CTL and CTG. Our participation in generation development projects involves using our surface lands and coal reserves as the basis for mine mouth plants, such as with our involvement in Prairie State. We are also advancing several initiatives associated with clean coal technologies, including CCS. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, availability of transportation for coal shipments, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the rate of the economic recovery. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our 36 Table of Contents mining costs or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Summary In the U.S., demand for coal rose approximately 75 million tons in 2010, led by a 5.5% increase in coal fueled generation and an 18 million ton rise in exports. The international coal markets strengthened in 2010 due to strong Asian demand growth and weather related generation recovery in the Atlantic markets, coupled with supply challenges across the major coal exporting nations of the Southern Hemisphere. Our analyses of general business conditions indicate the following: Seaborne coal demand increased an estimated 13% in 2010, led by a 32% recovery in global metallurgical coal demand; Pacific thermal coal demand for electricity generation rose 15% in 2010, while the Atlantic market declined 10%; Benchmark pricing of high quality, hard coking coal in the seaborne market has ranged between $200 to $225 per tonne since April 2010; The benchmark prompt seaborne thermal coal price in Newcastle, Australia rose 34% in 2010; U.S. coal generation accounted for nearly two thirds of the growth in total power output in 2010 due to new coal fueled generation, favorable weather, and a partial reversal of 2009s coal to gas switching; and Indexed U.S. coal prices rose in 2010 in all regions, with increases ranging from 30 to 50%. Our revenues increased compared to the prior year by $847.6 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year by $535.2 million, led by higher Australian pricing and sales volumes in the current year despite unfavorable weather related volume impacts that occurred late in 2010. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to the prior year by $347.2 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by increased income taxes, decreased Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and interest expense. We ended the year with total available liquidity of $2.7 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 163.8 160.1 3.7 2.3 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 29.7 31.8 (2.1 ) (6.6 )% Australian Mining 27.0 22.3 4.7 21.1 % Trading and Brokerage 25.4 29.4 (4.0 ) (13.6 )% Total tons sold 245.9 243.6 2.3 0.9 % 37 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,706.3 $ 2,612.6 $ 93.7 3.6 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,320.6 1,303.8 16.8 1.3 % Australian Mining 2,520.0 1,678.0 842.0 50.2 % Trading and Brokerage 291.1 391.0 (99.9 ) (25.5 )% Corporate and Other 22.0 27.0 (5.0 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,860.0 $ 6,012.4 $ 847.6 14.1 % The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 23.9%, led by increased pricing on seaborne metallurgical and thermal coals and a higher mix of metallurgical coal shipments. Volumes also increased in the current year (21.1%) driven by increased demand for metallurgical coal (metallurgical coal shipments of 9.8 million tons were 2.9 million tons, or 42%, greater than the prior year). These increases were muted to an extent by the flooding in Queensland in late 2010 that negatively impacted our production and also restricted throughput due to damage to the port and rail systems. The metallurgical coal demand increase reflects the strengthening of the coal markets as discussed above, coupled with prior year customer destocking of inventory and lower capacity utilization at steel customers. Western U.S. Mining operations revenues increased compared to the prior year due to increased sales volume (2.3%) driven by our Powder River Basin and Southwest regions due to increased customer demand and a higher weighted average sales price of 1.3%. In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements due to an increase in our weighted average sales price of 8.4% from contractual price increases were largely offset by decreased shipments (6.6%) on lower customer demand. Trading and Brokerage revenues were down primarily due to lower international brokerage revenues, unfavorable market movements on freight positions that support our export volumes and weather related shipment deferrals. Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 816.7 $ 721.5 $ 95.2 13.2 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 322.1 281.9 40.2 14.3 % Australian Mining 953.8 437.8 516.0 117.9 % Trading and Brokerage 77.2 193.4 (116.2 ) (60.1 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,169.8 $ 1,634.6 $ 535.2 32.7 % Our Australian Mining segment benefitted from a higher weighted average sales price ($413.0 million) and increased volumes ($127.9 million) as discussed above, and productivity improvements at our North Goonyella and Wambo underground mines along with fewer longwall move days in the current year ($116.0 million). Partially offsetting the above improvements were net higher adverse weather impacts 38 Table of Contents ($47.0 million) driven by the flooding in late 2010, unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($34.5 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced metallurgical coal shipments ($31.7 million) and increased demurrage costs ($10.7 million). Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to the higher volumes ($49.8 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($42.1 million) discussed above, lower repairs and maintenance costs due to timing of repairs and improved equipment efficiency ($35.0 million) and fewer longwall move days at our Twentymile Mine in the current year ($10.0 million), partially offset by prior year customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million) and increased commodity costs in the current year ($20.8 million). In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, a higher weighted average sales price ($98.5 million), as discussed above, was partially offset by lower volumes ($42.3 million) due to decreased demand and increased costs on lower productivity due to compliance measures and geological conditions at certain underground mines. Our Trading and Brokerage segment was down primarily due to the lower revenues as discussed above. Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,169.8 $ 1,634.6 $ 535.2 32.7 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1) (354.7 ) (344.5 ) (10.2 ) (3.0 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (440.9 ) (405.2 ) (35.7 ) (8.8 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.5 ) (40.1 ) (8.4 ) (20.9 )% Interest expense (222.1 ) (201.2 ) (20.9 ) (10.4 )% Interest income 9.6 8.1 1.5 18.5 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,113.2 $ 651.7 $ 461.5 70.8 % (1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was higher compared to the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense as discussed below: Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA: higher expense was primarily driven by a current year increase in selling and administrative expenses due to costs to support our business development and international expansion (e.g. headcount, travel, professional services, legal). We also incurred increased post mining costs driven by higher retiree healthcare amortization of actuarial losses and interest cost. These items were partially offset by improved results from equity affiliates primarily due to prior year losses of $54.6 million related to our equity investment in Carbones del Guasare, which included a $34.7 million impairment loss and $19.9 million of operating losses. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 39 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization: higher compared to the prior year due to increased production at our Australian mines with higher per ton depletion rates reflecting higher demand and additional depreciation expense associated with our new Bear Run Mine (commissioned in the second quarter of 2010). Interest expense: higher primarily due to refinancing charges ($9.3 million) associated with our new five year Credit Facility and charges ($8.4 million) associated with the extinguishment and refinancing of $650.0 million of senior notes. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,113.2 $ 651.7 $ 461.5 70.8 % Income tax provision (308.1 ) (193.8 ) (114.3 ) (59.0 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 805.1 457.9 347.2 75.8 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (2.9 ) 5.1 (8.0 ) 156.9 % Net income 802.2 463.0 339.2 73.3 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (28.2 ) (14.8 ) (13.4 ) (90.5 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 774.0 $ 448.2 $ 325.8 72.7 % Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to the prior year due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense due to higher current year earnings ($161.5 million) and current year income tax resulting from foreign earnings repatriation ($84.5 million), partially offset by A change in the valuation allowance ($46.4 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits, lower expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the larger increase in the Australian exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in the prior year compared to the current year ($26.8 million) as set forth in the table below, the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in the current year ($42.5 million), and lower expense in the current year due to the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination of the 2005 federal income tax year ($15.2 million). December 31, Rate Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 1.0163 $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.1194 $ 0.2041 Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2010 reflects a loss of $2.9 million as compared to income of $5.1 million in 2009 due primarily to a coal excise tax refund receivable of approximately $35 million recorded in 2009, partially offset by operating losses and loss on disposal of our Australian Chain Valley Mine in 2009. 40 Table of Contents Other The fair value of our foreign currency hedges increased approximately $434 million in 2010 mostly due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar in the current year. The increase is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Summary Our overall results for 2009 compared to 2008 reflect the unfavorable impact of lower global demand for coal as a result of the global economic recession. Despite the recession, our 2009 Adjusted EBITDA was the third highest in our 127 year history, only trailing 2008 and 2010. We also ended 2009 with total available liquidity of $2.5 billion. We continued to focus on strong cost control and productivity improvements, increased contributions from our high margin operations and exercising tight capital discipline. Our 2009 tons sold were below prior year levels reflecting planned production reductions in the Powder River Basin to match lower demand, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the full year operation of our El Segundo Mine in the Southwest. In the U.S., the decreased demand from lower industrial output, lower natural gas prices that resulted in higher fuel switching and higher coal stockpiles in the U.S. led to an 8.5 million ton decline in sales volume. In Australia, lower demand from steel customers resulted in a 1.3 million ton decline in metallurgical coal volume, although volumes in the second half of 2009 began to increase on an improved economic outlook led by demand from Asian Pacific markets. Our 2009 revenues declined compared to 2008 and were primarily impacted by Australias lower annual export contract pricing that commenced on April 1, 2009 as compared to 2008s record pricing and the overall decline in volume. Lower revenues were also driven by the decline in Trading and Brokerage revenues that resulted from lower coal pricing volatility. The lower Australian and Trading and Brokerage revenues were partially offset by an increase in U.S. revenues per ton that reflect multi year contracts signed at higher prices in recent years. While our Segment Adjusted EBITDA reflects the lower revenue discussed above, our 2009 margins also reflect the impact of producing at reduced levels as well as higher sales related costs. In addition, our costs in Australia were higher due to two additional longwall moves compared to 2008 and the impact of mining in difficult geologic conditions that also included higher costs for overburden removal. Net income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the above items, as well as lower results from equity affiliates and decreased net gains on disposals of assets. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $457.9 million in 2009, or $1.64 per diluted share, 53.6% below 2008 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $987.9 million, or $3.60 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 160.1 169.7 (9.6 ) (5.7 )% Midwestern U.S. Mining 31.8 30.7 1.1 3.6 % Australian Mining 22.3 23.4 (1.1 ) (4.7 )% Trading and Brokerage 29.4 31.2 (1.8 ) (5.8 )% Total tons sold 243.6 255.0 (11.4 ) (4.5 )% 41 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,612.6 $ 2,533.1 $ 79.5 3.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,303.8 1,154.6 149.2 12.9 % Australian Mining 1,678.0 2,242.8 (564.8 ) (25.2 )% Trading and Brokerage 391.0 601.8 (210.8 ) (35.0 )% Corporate and Other 27.0 28.7 (1.7 ) (5.9 )% Total revenues $ 6,012.4 $ 6,561.0 $ (548.6 ) (8.4 )% 2009 revenues were below the prior year driven by decreases in our Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage segments as discussed below: Australian Mining operations average sales price decreased 21.4% from the prior year reflecting the lower annual export contract pricing that commenced April 1, 2009 compared to the record pricing realized in 2008. The price decreases were combined with volume decreases from the prior year (4.7%) due to overall lower demand experienced in the first half of 2009. 2009 metallurgical coal shipments of 6.9 million tons were 1.3 million tons below the prior year. In the second half of 2009, 5.0 million tons of metallurgical coal were shipped, reflecting a partial recovery from the lower metallurgical coal shipments that occurred in the first half of the year. Trading and Brokerage revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower coal pricing volatility in 2009 resulting in lower margins on trading transactions, partially offset by profit from business contracted in 2008 that was realized in 2009 on an international brokerage arrangement. These decreases to revenues were partially offset by revenue increases in our Midwestern U.S. and Western U.S. Mining segments as discussed below: Midwestern U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.3%) driven by the benefit of higher Illinois Basin prices and increased shipments, including purchased coal used to satisfy certain coal supply agreements. Western U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.2%) due to a combination of higher contract pricing and a shift in sales mix. Revenues were also higher due to increased shipments from our El Segundo Mine (commissioned in June 2008) and customer contract termination and restructuring agreements. These increases were partially offset by the prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million) and an overall volume decrease (5.7%) reflecting our planned Powder River Basin production decreases to match demand. 42 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 721.5 $ 681.3 $ 40.2 5.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 281.9 177.3 104.6 59.0 % Australian Mining 437.8 1,016.6 (578.8 ) (56.9 )% Trading and Brokerage 193.4 218.9 (25.5 ) (11.6 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year due to lower annual export contract pricing and lower sales volume due to reduced demand ($416.0 million) as discussed above. Also impacting the segments Adjusted EBITDA was higher production costs ($170.7 million) driven by increased overburden stripping ratios and decreased longwall mine performance, which included higher costs associated with two additional longwall moves in 2009 compared to 2008. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net revenue discussed above. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher pricing ($205.5 million), partially offset by lower demand ($63.2 million), a prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million), higher sales related costs ($52.0 million) and lower productivity due to increased stripping ratios ($20.8 million). The impact of lower demand was partially mitigated by revenues from customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million). Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year primarily due to higher pricing ($110.7 million) and decreased commodity costs ($16.0 million), partially offset by higher costs associated with mining in more difficult geological conditions compared to the prior year ($20.7 million). Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1) (344.5 ) (247.2 ) (97.3 ) (39.4 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (405.2 ) (402.4 ) (2.8 ) (0.7 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (40.1 ) (48.2 ) 8.1 16.8 % Interest expense (201.2 ) (227.0 ) 25.8 11.4 % Interest income 8.1 10.0 (1.9 ) (19.0 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% 43 Table of Contents (1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from the prior year primarily due to the lower Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above and lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense and asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease of $97.3 million in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the following: Lower results from equity affiliates ($69.1 million) primarily from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela). Carbones del Guasare incurred unfavorable results in 2009 compared to 2008 (our share of which was $25.6 million) due to lower productivity, higher operating costs and ongoing labor issues; in addition, we recognized a $34.7 million impairment loss on this investment. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Lower net gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($49.7 million) was due primarily to a $54.0 million gain in the prior year from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. The above decreases to Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA were offset by lower costs associated with Btu Conversion activities ($16.9 million). Interest expense was lower than the prior year due to lower variable interest rates on our Term Loan Facility and accounts receivable securitization program and lower average borrowings on our Revolver. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates reflecting lower fuel and re vegetation costs incurred in our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% Income tax provision (193.8 ) (191.4 ) (2.4 ) (1.3 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 457.9 987.9 (530.0 ) (53.6 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5.1 (28.8 ) 33.9 117.7 % Net income 463.0 959.1 (496.1 ) (51.7 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14.8 ) (6.2 ) (8.6 ) (138.7 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 448.2 $ 952.9 $ (504.7 ) (53.0 )% 44 Table of Contents Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the strengthening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar ($139.6 million; exchange rate rose 29% in 2009 compared to a 21% decrease in 2008, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.2041 $ (0.1888 ) The prior year release of a foreign valuation allowance related to our Australian net operating loss carry forwards ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. The above increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower pre tax earnings in 2009, which drove a decrease to the income tax provision ($184.6 million). Income from discontinued operations increased compared to the prior year as the prior year included operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine and an $11.7 million write off of a coal excise tax receivable in the first quarter of 2008. In late 2008, legislation was passed which contained provisions that allowed for the refund of coal excise tax collected on certain coal shipments. In 2009, we received a coal excise tax refund resulting in approximately $35 million, net of income taxes, recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund). Partially offsetting the 2009 excise tax refund were operating losses associated with discontinued operations and assets held for sale ($20.6 million) and a $10.0 million loss on the sale of our Chain Valley Mine in Australia. Outlook Near Term Outlook The World Bank estimates global economic activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), expanded 3.9% in 2010. Global GDP is projected to grow another 3.3% in 2011 and 3.6% in 2012, with developing economies, led by China and India, expanding 6% or more in each year, more than twice the growth expected for high income countries. Chinas GDP is projected by the World Bank to grow 10.0% in 2010 and 8.7% in 2011. India, the worlds second fastest growing economy, is projected by the World Bank to grow 9.5% in 2010 and 8.4% in 2011. According to the World Steel Association (WSA), global steel use was expected to increase 13.1% in 2010, followed by another 5.3% in 2011 to a record 1.3 billion tonnes. The WSA forecasts Indias steel demand would rise 8.2% in 2010 and 13.6% in 2011. Similar trends are apparent in steel production. For 2010, global steel production exceeded prior year levels by 15%, led by Asia based production (Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China and India). Industry reports indicate China, the worlds largest steel consumer, is expected to grow its steel use 11% in 2010, and is projected to grow a further 8% to 9% in 2011. Industry reports forecast nearly 85 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation globally were due to come on line during 2010; nearly 80% of which were in China and India. New global coal fueled generation for 2010 is estimated to require approximately 290 million tons of coal annually. For 2011, approximately 90 gigawatts are expected to be under construction and or come online, requiring more than 340 million tons of coal. China and India continue to make up the vast majority. Given the pace of coal demand in the Pacific throughout 2010, coupled with late 2010 weather related demand increases in the Northern Hemisphere and supply constraints in key nations such as Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, South America and Canada, prices for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal 45 Table of Contents have been increasing. High quality, hard coking coal prices have increased from $129 per tonne for annual contracts commencing April 2009, to quarterly (April, July, October 2010) prices ranging between $200 and $225 per tonne, with January 2011 spot price exceeding $350 per tonne. Prompt index prices for Australian seaborne thermal coal rose 34% by year end 2010, and have risen another 10% as of January 18, 2011. Accordingly to the Energy Information Administrations (EIA) Short Term Energy Outlook, 2011 coal consumption, coal production and utility coal stockpiles in the U.S. are projected to be essentially on par with 2010. U.S. growth is projected to resume in 2012, with the increased consumption being matched by higher production, resulting in minimal change to utility coal stockpiles. U.S. natural gas consumption increased 5.5% and production rose approximately 4% in 2010, according to the EIA. Rising supplies combined with persistently high inventory levels have resulted in subdued gas prices. The NYMEX Henry Hub spot price averaged $4.52 per thousand cubic feet in 2010, above 2009s average $4.06 per thousand cubic feet yet 67% below the 2007 2009 average. The EIA also projects that natural gas consumption, production and storage levels will decline slightly in 2011. Like coal, natural gas consumption is expected to grow in 2012, approximately 1.6% to 66.5 billion cubic feet. The projected production decline in 2011 and higher natural gas consumption in 2012 are expected to lead to strengthening natural gas prices. As natural gas prices begin to rise, natural gas production is expected to rebound, growing approximately 2% in 2012. U.S. shale natural gas development continues in the U.S. accounting for approximately 20% of gas supply in 2010 and is estimated by the PIRA Energy Group to grow to over 30% of gas supply over the next several years. This is expected to lead to continued growth in gas fired electricity in the U.S. As of January 25, 2011, we had 7 to 8 million tons of our targeted 2011 metallurgical coal volumes and 6 to 7 million tons of our planned seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in the last three quarters of 2011. For 2012, all of our expected metallurgical coal sales and 12 to 13 million tons of our estimated seaborne thermal coal sales are available to price. In the U.S., we have modest amounts of coal to price in 2011, 35% to 40% in 2012 and 75% to 85% in 2013. We may continue to adjust our production levels in response to change in market demand. We continue to manage costs and operating performance in an effort to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of suboptimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Reductions in the relative cost of other fuels, including natural gas, could impact the use of coal for electricity generation. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. We rely on ongoing access to worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly, many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, bank guarantees, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. Dodd Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Act, which includes a number of provisions applicable to us in the areas of corporate governance, executive compensation and mine safety and extractive industries disclosure. In addition, the Dodd Frank Act imposes additional regulation 46 Table of Contents of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. Although the Dodd Frank Act became generally effective upon its enactment, many provisions have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and require further action by the federal regulatory authorities. As a result, in many respects the ultimate impact of the Dodd Frank Act on us will not be fully known for an extended period of time. We do expect that the Dodd Frank Act will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and Trading and Brokerage activities. Minerals Resource Rent Tax. On May 2, 2010, the Australian government released a report on Australias Future Tax System, which included a recommendation to replace the current resource taxing arrangements imposed on non renewable resources by the Australian federal and state governments with a uniform resource rent tax (the Resource Tax) imposed and administered by the Australian government. As proposed, the Resource Tax would be profit based and would apply to non renewable resources projects, including existing projects. On July 2, 2010, the Australian government announced changes to the Resource Tax and proposed a new minerals resource rent tax (the MRRT). The MRRT would still be profit based, but measures were introduced to lessen the impact of the MRRT. The Australian government and major industry policy makers are actively engaged to work through various structural aspects of the proposed MRRT together with detailed implementation issues. The Committee charged with consulting with industry and preparing recommendations as to the final form of the MRRT submitted its report in late December 2010. The Committees recommendations largely endorse the mining industrys understanding as to what was agreed with the federal government prior to the federal election. The Committees recommendations notwithstanding, it remains to be seen whether the federal government will adopt all recommendations, in particular the recommendation that all state royalties (current and future) are creditable against MRRT payments. MRRT is not yet law in Australia; exposure draft legislation is expected in mid 2011. Following the release of the draft legislation, industry participants will engage in further consultation with the federal government as required. The draft law is expected to be presented to the Australian Parliament in late 2011, and if the MRRT becomes law, it is intended to become effective July 1, 2012. If the MRRT were to become law, it may affect the financial performance of our Australian operations from the effective date forward. Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for the past decade. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates in its World Energy Outlook issued in November 2010, current policies scenario, that world primary energy demand will grow 47% between 2008 and 2035. Demand for coal is projected to rise 59%, outpacing the growth rate of oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro and biomass. China and India alone account for more than 85% of the 2008 2035 coal based primary energy demand growth. Under the current policies scenario, the IEA expects coal to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide. Coals share of the power generation mix was 41% in 2008. By 2035, the IEA estimates coals fuel share to be 43% as it continues to have the largest share of worldwide electric power production. Currently, we estimate approximately 390 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity generating plants are planned or under construction around the world, with expected online dates ranging between 2011 and 2015. When complete, those plants would require an estimated 1.4 billion tons of annual coal demand. In the U.S., while some planned coal based plants have been cancelled, 13 gigawatts of new coal based generating capacity have been completed in 2010 or are under construction with completion dates of 2011 2013, representing approximately 55 million tons of annual coal demand once they become operational. The IEA projects global natural gas fueled electricity generation will have a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%, from 4.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2008 to 8.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2035. The total amount of electricity generated from natural gas is expected to be approximately one half the total for coal, even in 2035. Renewables are projected to comprise 23% of the 2035 fuel mix versus 19% in 2008. Nuclear power is expected to grow 52%, however its share of total generation is expected to fall from 13.5% to 11% between 47 Table of Contents 2008 and 2035. Generation from liquid fuels is projected to decline an average of 2.2% annually to 1.5% of the 2035 generation mix. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as CTG and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. Several CTG and CTL facilities are currently under development in China and India. We continue to support clean coal technology development toward the ultimate goal of near zero emissions, and we are advancing more than a dozen projects and partnerships in the U.S., China and Australia. In addition, clean coal technology development in the U.S. is being accelerated by funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and by the formation of an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the commercial development of five to ten commercial CCS projects by 2016. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of CCS technologies. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions. Along with cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity includes the available balances from our Revolver under the Credit Facility, accounts receivable securitization program and a bank overdraft facility in Australia. Our liquidity is also impacted by activity under certain bilateral cash collateralization arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and our total available liquidity was $2.7 billion. We currently expect that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements during the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future, as described below in Capital Requirements. In addition to the above items, alternative sources of liquidity include the ability to offer and sell certain securities under our shelf registration (as described below). In 2010, we replaced our previous $1.8 billion revolving credit facility with a $1.5 billion Revolver under a new Credit Facility (as described below). Also, additional information on our accounts receivable securitization program and bilateral cash collateralization arrangements can be found in the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements section. Credit Facility. On June 18, 2010, we entered into a Credit Agreement which established a $2.0 billion Credit Facility and replaced our third amended and restated credit agreement dated September 15, 2006. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.5 billion Revolver and a $500.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan). We have the option to request an increase in the capacity of the Credit Facility (but no lender is obligated to increase its commitment to us), provided the aggregate increase for the Revolver and Term Loan does not exceed $250.0 million, the minimum amount of the increase is $25.0 million, and certain other conditions are met under the Credit Agreement. The Revolver also includes a swingline sub facility where up to $50.0 million is available for same day borrowings. The Revolver commitments and the Term Loan under the Credit Facility will mature on June 18, 2015. The Term Loan is subject to quarterly repayment of 1.25% per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, with the final payment of all amounts outstanding (including accrued interest) being due five years from the date of the execution of the Credit Agreement. 48 Table of Contents The Revolver replaced our previous $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and the Term Loan replaced our previous term loan facility (the previous term loan had a balance of $490.3 million at the time of replacement and at December 31, 2009). We recorded $21.9 million in deferred financing costs which are being amortized to interest expense over the five year term of the Credit Facility, and incurred refinancing charges of $9.3 million, which is classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver in 2010 or 2009, or at December 31, 2010. However, we had $67.6 million of outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2010, which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the Revolver by the same amount. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new Credit Facility. Shelf Registration. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires August 7, 2012), at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time: securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Capital Requirements Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, coal reserve lease and royalty payments, debt service costs (interest and principal), lease obligations, take or pay obligations and costs related to past mining obligations. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of certain of our debt instruments. We generally fund our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2011 are anticipated to be $900 to $950 million; including $500 to $550 million earmarked for new mines, expansion and extension projects. Approximately 70% of the growth and expansion capital is targeted for various Australian projects for metallurgical and thermal coal, with the remainder in the U.S. Estimated capital expenditures also include funding for our share of construction costs for Prairie State. Prairie State. We spent $76.0 million during 2010 representing our 5.06% share of the construction costs. Included in Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, are costs of $202.5 million and $126.5 million, respectively. Our share of total construction costs for Prairie State is expected to be approximately $250 million, with most of the remaining funding expected in 2011. GreenGen. During 2010, we spent $3.1 million representing our 6.0% share of the construction costs, which is reflected as capitalized development costs as part of Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. There were no expenditures for GreenGen for 2009. Our share of total construction costs for GreenGen is expected to be approximately $60 million. Dividends. We have declared and paid quarterly dividends since our initial public offering in 2001. In January 2011, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.085 per share of common stock, payable on March 3, 2011. The declaration and payment of dividends and the amount of dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by our debt instruments and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Pension Contributions. During 2010, we made contributions of $112.6 million, which includes our estimate of required contributions for 2011 (based on current assumptions). Share Repurchase Program. At December 31, 2010, our available capacity for share repurchases was $700.4 million, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside of the share repurchase program. While no such share repurchases were made in 2010, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. 49 Table of Contents NCIG. Financing for phase one of stage two of construction closed in 2010 with us providing our pro rata share of funding of $59.7 million Australian dollars ($54.8 million U.S. dollars). NCIG may further expand the coal transloading facilitys capacity which could require us to fund our pro rata share in a similar manner. Senior Notes. On August 25, 2010, we completed a $650.0 million offering of 6.5% 10 year Senior Notes due September 2020 (the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness; equally in right of payment with any senior indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to our future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and effectively junior to all the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2011. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by nearly all of our domestic subsidiaries, as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions. The Notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus a make whole premium and any accrued unpaid interest to the redemption date. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, and cash on hand, to extinguish our previously outstanding $650.0 million aggregate principal 6.875% Senior Notes formerly due in March 2013 (the 2013 Notes). All of the 2013 Notes were either tendered or redeemed in 2010. We recognized debt extinguishment costs of $8.4 million, which are classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The issuance of the Notes and the extinguishment of the 2013 Notes allowed us to lengthen the maturity of our senior indebtedness and lower the coupon rate. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Notes. Total Indebtedness. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, consisted of the following: December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan $ 493.8 $ 490.3 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013 650.0 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2016 218.1 218.1 7.375% Senior Notes due November 2016 650.0 650.0 6.5% Senior Notes due September 2020 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026 247.2 247.1 6.34% Series B Bonds due December 2014 12.0 15.0 6.84% Series C Bonds due December 2016 33.0 33.0 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 373.3 371.5 Capital lease obligations 69.6 67.5 Fair value hedge adjustment 2.2 8.4 Other 0.8 1.4 Total $ 2,750.0 $ 2,752.3 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Facility, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 6.5% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2010. 50 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flows Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Cash Flow 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,087.1 $ 1,050.2 $ 36.9 3.5 % Net cash used in investing activities (703.6 ) (406.5 ) (297.1 ) 73.1 % Net cash used in financing activities (77.1 ) (104.6 ) 27.5 (26.3 )% Operating Activities. The changes from the prior year were driven by the following: Strong operating cash flows generated from our Australian Mining operations driven by higher volumes and pricing; partially offset by Increased margin posted for our derivative trading instruments; Lower utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program in the current year; and Higher pension payments in the current year. Investing Activities. The changes from the prior year were driven by the following: Higher current year capital spending of $296.4 million related primarily to our Bear Run Mine; Current year net cash outflows related to our pro rata share of funding for the NCIG coal transloading facility; and The collection of a note receivable of $30.0 million in the prior year; partially offset by Federal coal lease expenditures of $123.6 million in the prior year. Financing Activities. The increase compared to the prior year was primarily due to the excess tax benefits related to share based compensation of $51.0 million, partially offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $32.2 million in the current year related to our Credit Facility refinancing and the offering of the Notes. The proceeds from long term debt include $500.0 million from the Term Loan and $641.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. These proceeds were used to pay off the $490.3 million balance due on our previous term loan facility and the previously outstanding $650.0 million 2013 Notes. Other Long Term Debt. A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,621.6 $ 213.4 $ 436.6 $ 789.4 $ 4,182.2 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 74.6 17.0 42.1 15.5 Operating lease obligations 455.8 95.6 147.2 106.1 106.9 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 458.2 406.7 51.5 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 62.0 7.2 14.3 10.2 30.3 Take or pay obligations(2) 2,892.9 217.5 465.9 425.7 1,783.8 Other long term liabilities(3) 2,204.1 154.6 301.7 298.7 1,449.1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 11,769.2 $ 1,112.0 $ 1,459.3 $ 1,645.6 $ 7,552.3 51 Table of Contents (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures relate to new mines and expansion and extension projects in Australia and the U.S. (2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal including amounts relating to export facilities. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We do not expect any of the $111.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization program. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. Accounts Receivable Securitization. We have an accounts receivable securitization program (securitization program) through our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary (Seller). Under the securitization program, beginning in 2010, we contribute, on a revolving basis, trade receivables of most of our U.S. subsidiaries to the Seller, which then sells the receivables in their entirety to a consortium of unaffiliated asset backed commercial paper conduits (the Conduits). After the sale, we, as servicer of the assets, collect the receivables on behalf of the Conduits for a nominal servicing fee. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to short term borrowings under our Credit Facility, effectively managing our overall borrowing costs and providing an additional source for working capital. The securitization program was renewed in May 2009 and amended in December 2009 in order to qualify for sale accounting under a newly adopted accounting standard related to financial asset transfers. Prior to amending the securitization program, we sold senior undivided interests in certain of our accounts receivable and retained subordinated interests in those receivables. The current securitization program extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually. The Seller is a separate legal entity whose assets are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Of the receivables sold to the Conduits, a portion of the amount due to the Seller is deferred until the ultimate collection of the underlying receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received total consideration of $4,576.3 million related to accounts receivable sold under the securitization program, including $2,460.1 million of cash up front from the sale of the receivables, an additional $1,953.6 million of cash upon the collection of the underlying receivables, and $162.6 million that had not been collected at December 31, 2010 and was recorded at fair value, which approximates carrying value. The reduction in accounts receivable as a result of securitization activity with the Conduits was $150.0 million at December 31, 2010 and $254.6 million at December 31, 2009. The securitization activity has been reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activity because both the cash received from the Conduits upon sale of receivables as well as the cash received from the Conduits upon the ultimate collection of receivables are not subject to significantly different risks given the short term nature of our trade receivables. We recorded expense associated with securitization 52 Table of Contents transactions of $2.4 million, $4.0 million and $10.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. In 2010, we added standalone credit facilities with multiple banks to allow us to obtain letters of credit and bank guarantees in support of certain operations outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2010, the total capacity under these new facilities, both committed and uncommitted, was approximately $324 million, of which approximately $141 million was utilized (based on the U.S. dollar exchange rate at December 31, 2010). Also during 2010, we entered into a bilateral cash collateralized agreement in support of certain letters of credit whereby we posted cash collateral in lieu of utilizing our Credit Facility. Such cash collateral is classified within cash and cash equivalents given our ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are also required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Postretirement Benefit and Pension Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 for pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $115.6 million, while funding payments were $187.9 million. Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 7.8 $ (6.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 112.5 $ (94.4 ) 53 Table of Contents Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.6 $ (0.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (51.1 ) $ 58.8 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 11.93 years at December 31, 2010. Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $48.5 million, and payments totaled $14.1 million. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ. Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three level hierarchy, Levels 1, 2 and 3. Level 3 fair value measurements are those where inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants. Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include 54 Table of Contents forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 3% and 5%, respectively, of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities in over the counter markets (coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. We perform a VaR analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter and brokerage coal trading. The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical 55 Table of Contents chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not capture the loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR. The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. In 2010, we modified our VaR methodology to be in line with our global trading strategy. The previous methodology used an additive approach whereby the domestic portfolio and the international portfolio were calculated separately and then added together to arrive at our total global VaR. The new methodology explicitly considers correlation measures between the domestic and the international portfolios to consolidate our total global VaR. The high, low and average VaR for the year ended December 31, 2010 is set forth in the table below under the previous and new methodology : Year Ended December 31, 2010 Low High Average (Dollars in millions) Previous Methodology $ 4.5 $ 37.6 $ 10.1 New Methodology $ 3.4 $ 18.8 $ 7.0 As of December 31, 2010, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage of Expiration Portfolio Total 2011 70 % 2012 21 % 2013 3 % 2014 4 % 2015 2 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Nonperformance and Credit Risk Coal Trading. The fair value of our coal trading assets and liabilities reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our exposure is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral (margin), requiring prepayments for shipments or the 56 Table of Contents creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions. Non Coal Trading. The fair value of our non coal trading derivative assets and liabilities also reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. We conduct our hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks and closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. To reduce our credit exposure for these hedging activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.10 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $208 million for 2011. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $60 million for 2011. The table at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2010. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we manage our debt to achieve a certain ratio of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, we had $2.3 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $0.5 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding and had no interest rate swaps in place. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $5 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $163 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. Sales under such agreements comprised approximately 91%, 93% and 90% of our worldwide sales (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Substantially all of our coal in the U.S is contracted in 2011 at planned production levels. We had 13 to 15 million tons remaining to be priced for 2011 in Australia at January 25, 2011. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of cost pass through contracts and derivatives, primarily swaps. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 145 to 150 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2011. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $36 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $14 million. 57 Table of Contents Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 355,000 to 365,000 tons of explosives during 2011 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $6 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $2 million. Notional Amounts and Fair Value.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the worlds largest private sector coal company, with majority interests in 28 coal mining operations in the U.S. and Australia. In 2010, we produced 218.4 million tons of coal and sold 245.9 million tons of coal. We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining operations consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining operations consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining Segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal primarily sold to an international customer base with a portion sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Metallurgical coal is produced primarily from five of our Australian mines. In the U.S., we typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). In Australia, our production is sold primarily into the export metallurgical and thermal markets with an increasing number of the contracts negotiated with our customers on a quarterly basis. During 2010, approximately 91% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2010, 84% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 14% were to customers outside the U.S. and 2% were to the U.S. industrial sector. Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations. Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, as well as the management of our vast coal reserve and real estate holdings. We continue to pursue Btu Conversion projects that expand the uses of coal through CTL and CTG. Our participation in generation development projects involves using our surface lands and coal reserves as the basis for mine mouth plants, such as with our involvement in Prairie State. We are also advancing several initiatives associated with clean coal technologies, including CCS. As discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions, availability of transportation for coal shipments, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the rate of the economic recovery. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our 36 Table of Contents mining costs or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels further in response to changes in market demand. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Summary In the U.S., demand for coal rose approximately 75 million tons in 2010, led by a 5.5% increase in coal fueled generation and an 18 million ton rise in exports. The international coal markets strengthened in 2010 due to strong Asian demand growth and weather related generation recovery in the Atlantic markets, coupled with supply challenges across the major coal exporting nations of the Southern Hemisphere. Our analyses of general business conditions indicate the following: Seaborne coal demand increased an estimated 13% in 2010, led by a 32% recovery in global metallurgical coal demand; Pacific thermal coal demand for electricity generation rose 15% in 2010, while the Atlantic market declined 10%; Benchmark pricing of high quality, hard coking coal in the seaborne market has ranged between $200 to $225 per tonne since April 2010; The benchmark prompt seaborne thermal coal price in Newcastle, Australia rose 34% in 2010; U.S. coal generation accounted for nearly two thirds of the growth in total power output in 2010 due to new coal fueled generation, favorable weather, and a partial reversal of 2009s coal to gas switching; and Indexed U.S. coal prices rose in 2010 in all regions, with increases ranging from 30 to 50%. Our revenues increased compared to the prior year by $847.6 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year by $535.2 million, led by higher Australian pricing and sales volumes in the current year despite unfavorable weather related volume impacts that occurred late in 2010. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to the prior year by $347.2 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by increased income taxes, decreased Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and interest expense. We ended the year with total available liquidity of $2.7 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 163.8 160.1 3.7 2.3 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 29.7 31.8 (2.1 ) (6.6 )% Australian Mining 27.0 22.3 4.7 21.1 % Trading and Brokerage 25.4 29.4 (4.0 ) (13.6 )% Total tons sold 245.9 243.6 2.3 0.9 % 37 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,706.3 $ 2,612.6 $ 93.7 3.6 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,320.6 1,303.8 16.8 1.3 % Australian Mining 2,520.0 1,678.0 842.0 50.2 % Trading and Brokerage 291.1 391.0 (99.9 ) (25.5 )% Corporate and Other 22.0 27.0 (5.0 ) (18.5 )% Total revenues $ 6,860.0 $ 6,012.4 $ 847.6 14.1 % The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 23.9%, led by increased pricing on seaborne metallurgical and thermal coals and a higher mix of metallurgical coal shipments. Volumes also increased in the current year (21.1%) driven by increased demand for metallurgical coal (metallurgical coal shipments of 9.8 million tons were 2.9 million tons, or 42%, greater than the prior year). These increases were muted to an extent by the flooding in Queensland in late 2010 that negatively impacted our production and also restricted throughput due to damage to the port and rail systems. The metallurgical coal demand increase reflects the strengthening of the coal markets as discussed above, coupled with prior year customer destocking of inventory and lower capacity utilization at steel customers. Western U.S. Mining operations revenues increased compared to the prior year due to increased sales volume (2.3%) driven by our Powder River Basin and Southwest regions due to increased customer demand and a higher weighted average sales price of 1.3%. In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements due to an increase in our weighted average sales price of 8.4% from contractual price increases were largely offset by decreased shipments (6.6%) on lower customer demand. Trading and Brokerage revenues were down primarily due to lower international brokerage revenues, unfavorable market movements on freight positions that support our export volumes and weather related shipment deferrals. Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 816.7 $ 721.5 $ 95.2 13.2 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 322.1 281.9 40.2 14.3 % Australian Mining 953.8 437.8 516.0 117.9 % Trading and Brokerage 77.2 193.4 (116.2 ) (60.1 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,169.8 $ 1,634.6 $ 535.2 32.7 % Our Australian Mining segment benefitted from a higher weighted average sales price ($413.0 million) and increased volumes ($127.9 million) as discussed above, and productivity improvements at our North Goonyella and Wambo underground mines along with fewer longwall move days in the current year ($116.0 million). Partially offsetting the above improvements were net higher adverse weather impacts 38 Table of Contents ($47.0 million) driven by the flooding in late 2010, unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($34.5 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced metallurgical coal shipments ($31.7 million) and increased demurrage costs ($10.7 million). Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to the higher volumes ($49.8 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($42.1 million) discussed above, lower repairs and maintenance costs due to timing of repairs and improved equipment efficiency ($35.0 million) and fewer longwall move days at our Twentymile Mine in the current year ($10.0 million), partially offset by prior year customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million) and increased commodity costs in the current year ($20.8 million). In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, a higher weighted average sales price ($98.5 million), as discussed above, was partially offset by lower volumes ($42.3 million) due to decreased demand and increased costs on lower productivity due to compliance measures and geological conditions at certain underground mines. Our Trading and Brokerage segment was down primarily due to the lower revenues as discussed above. Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,169.8 $ 1,634.6 $ 535.2 32.7 % Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1) (354.7 ) (344.5 ) (10.2 ) (3.0 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (440.9 ) (405.2 ) (35.7 ) (8.8 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (48.5 ) (40.1 ) (8.4 ) (20.9 )% Interest expense (222.1 ) (201.2 ) (20.9 ) (10.4 )% Interest income 9.6 8.1 1.5 18.5 % Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,113.2 $ 651.7 $ 461.5 70.8 % (1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was higher compared to the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense as discussed below: Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA: higher expense was primarily driven by a current year increase in selling and administrative expenses due to costs to support our business development and international expansion (e.g. headcount, travel, professional services, legal). We also incurred increased post mining costs driven by higher retiree healthcare amortization of actuarial losses and interest cost. These items were partially offset by improved results from equity affiliates primarily due to prior year losses of $54.6 million related to our equity investment in Carbones del Guasare, which included a $34.7 million impairment loss and $19.9 million of operating losses. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 39 Table of Contents Depreciation, depletion and amortization: higher compared to the prior year due to increased production at our Australian mines with higher per ton depletion rates reflecting higher demand and additional depreciation expense associated with our new Bear Run Mine (commissioned in the second quarter of 2010). Interest expense: higher primarily due to refinancing charges ($9.3 million) associated with our new five year Credit Facility and charges ($8.4 million) associated with the extinguishment and refinancing of $650.0 million of senior notes. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 1,113.2 $ 651.7 $ 461.5 70.8 % Income tax provision (308.1 ) (193.8 ) (114.3 ) (59.0 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 805.1 457.9 347.2 75.8 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (2.9 ) 5.1 (8.0 ) 156.9 % Net income 802.2 463.0 339.2 73.3 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (28.2 ) (14.8 ) (13.4 ) (90.5 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 774.0 $ 448.2 $ 325.8 72.7 % Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to the prior year due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense due to higher current year earnings ($161.5 million) and current year income tax resulting from foreign earnings repatriation ($84.5 million), partially offset by A change in the valuation allowance ($46.4 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits, lower expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the larger increase in the Australian exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in the prior year compared to the current year ($26.8 million) as set forth in the table below, the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in the current year ($42.5 million), and lower expense in the current year due to the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination of the 2005 federal income tax year ($15.2 million). December 31, Rate Change 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 1.0163 $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.1194 $ 0.2041 Income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2010 reflects a loss of $2.9 million as compared to income of $5.1 million in 2009 due primarily to a coal excise tax refund receivable of approximately $35 million recorded in 2009, partially offset by operating losses and loss on disposal of our Australian Chain Valley Mine in 2009. 40 Table of Contents Other The fair value of our foreign currency hedges increased approximately $434 million in 2010 mostly due to the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar in the current year. The increase is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Summary Our overall results for 2009 compared to 2008 reflect the unfavorable impact of lower global demand for coal as a result of the global economic recession. Despite the recession, our 2009 Adjusted EBITDA was the third highest in our 127 year history, only trailing 2008 and 2010. We also ended 2009 with total available liquidity of $2.5 billion. We continued to focus on strong cost control and productivity improvements, increased contributions from our high margin operations and exercising tight capital discipline. Our 2009 tons sold were below prior year levels reflecting planned production reductions in the Powder River Basin to match lower demand, partially offset by increased volumes associated with the full year operation of our El Segundo Mine in the Southwest. In the U.S., the decreased demand from lower industrial output, lower natural gas prices that resulted in higher fuel switching and higher coal stockpiles in the U.S. led to an 8.5 million ton decline in sales volume. In Australia, lower demand from steel customers resulted in a 1.3 million ton decline in metallurgical coal volume, although volumes in the second half of 2009 began to increase on an improved economic outlook led by demand from Asian Pacific markets. Our 2009 revenues declined compared to 2008 and were primarily impacted by Australias lower annual export contract pricing that commenced on April 1, 2009 as compared to 2008s record pricing and the overall decline in volume. Lower revenues were also driven by the decline in Trading and Brokerage revenues that resulted from lower coal pricing volatility. The lower Australian and Trading and Brokerage revenues were partially offset by an increase in U.S. revenues per ton that reflect multi year contracts signed at higher prices in recent years. While our Segment Adjusted EBITDA reflects the lower revenue discussed above, our 2009 margins also reflect the impact of producing at reduced levels as well as higher sales related costs. In addition, our costs in Australia were higher due to two additional longwall moves compared to 2008 and the impact of mining in difficult geologic conditions that also included higher costs for overburden removal. Net income declined in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting the above items, as well as lower results from equity affiliates and decreased net gains on disposals of assets. Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes was $457.9 million in 2009, or $1.64 per diluted share, 53.6% below 2008 income from continuing operations, net of income taxes of $987.9 million, or $3.60 per diluted share. Tons Sold The following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining 160.1 169.7 (9.6 ) (5.7 )% Midwestern U.S. Mining 31.8 30.7 1.1 3.6 % Australian Mining 22.3 23.4 (1.1 ) (4.7 )% Trading and Brokerage 29.4 31.2 (1.8 ) (5.8 )% Total tons sold 243.6 255.0 (11.4 ) (4.5 )% 41 Table of Contents Revenues The following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Revenues 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 2,612.6 $ 2,533.1 $ 79.5 3.1 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 1,303.8 1,154.6 149.2 12.9 % Australian Mining 1,678.0 2,242.8 (564.8 ) (25.2 )% Trading and Brokerage 391.0 601.8 (210.8 ) (35.0 )% Corporate and Other 27.0 28.7 (1.7 ) (5.9 )% Total revenues $ 6,012.4 $ 6,561.0 $ (548.6 ) (8.4 )% 2009 revenues were below the prior year driven by decreases in our Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage segments as discussed below: Australian Mining operations average sales price decreased 21.4% from the prior year reflecting the lower annual export contract pricing that commenced April 1, 2009 compared to the record pricing realized in 2008. The price decreases were combined with volume decreases from the prior year (4.7%) due to overall lower demand experienced in the first half of 2009. 2009 metallurgical coal shipments of 6.9 million tons were 1.3 million tons below the prior year. In the second half of 2009, 5.0 million tons of metallurgical coal were shipped, reflecting a partial recovery from the lower metallurgical coal shipments that occurred in the first half of the year. Trading and Brokerage revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower coal pricing volatility in 2009 resulting in lower margins on trading transactions, partially offset by profit from business contracted in 2008 that was realized in 2009 on an international brokerage arrangement. These decreases to revenues were partially offset by revenue increases in our Midwestern U.S. and Western U.S. Mining segments as discussed below: Midwestern U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.3%) driven by the benefit of higher Illinois Basin prices and increased shipments, including purchased coal used to satisfy certain coal supply agreements. Western U.S. Mining operations average sales price increased over the prior year (9.2%) due to a combination of higher contract pricing and a shift in sales mix. Revenues were also higher due to increased shipments from our El Segundo Mine (commissioned in June 2008) and customer contract termination and restructuring agreements. These increases were partially offset by the prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million) and an overall volume decrease (5.7%) reflecting our planned Powder River Basin production decreases to match demand. 42 Table of Contents Segment Adjusted EBITDA The following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining $ 721.5 $ 681.3 $ 40.2 5.9 % Midwestern U.S. Mining 281.9 177.3 104.6 59.0 % Australian Mining 437.8 1,016.6 (578.8 ) (56.9 )% Trading and Brokerage 193.4 218.9 (25.5 ) (11.6 )% Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Australian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year due to lower annual export contract pricing and lower sales volume due to reduced demand ($416.0 million) as discussed above. Also impacting the segments Adjusted EBITDA was higher production costs ($170.7 million) driven by increased overburden stripping ratios and decreased longwall mine performance, which included higher costs associated with two additional longwall moves in 2009 compared to 2008. Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net revenue discussed above. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year driven by higher pricing ($205.5 million), partially offset by lower demand ($63.2 million), a prior year revenue recovery on a long term coal supply agreement ($56.9 million), higher sales related costs ($52.0 million) and lower productivity due to increased stripping ratios ($20.8 million). The impact of lower demand was partially mitigated by revenues from customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million). Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year primarily due to higher pricing ($110.7 million) and decreased commodity costs ($16.0 million), partially offset by higher costs associated with mining in more difficult geological conditions compared to the prior year ($20.7 million). Income From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes The following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,634.6 $ 2,094.1 $ (459.5 ) (21.9 )% Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1) (344.5 ) (247.2 ) (97.3 ) (39.4 )% Depreciation, depletion and amortization (405.2 ) (402.4 ) (2.8 ) (0.7 )% Asset retirement obligation expense (40.1 ) (48.2 ) 8.1 16.8 % Interest expense (201.2 ) (227.0 ) 25.8 11.4 % Interest income 8.1 10.0 (1.9 ) (19.0 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% 43 Table of Contents (1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, net gains on asset disposals or exchanges, costs associated with past mining obligations and revenues and expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion development costs. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased from the prior year primarily due to the lower Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above and lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by lower interest expense and asset retirement obligation expense. The decrease of $97.3 million in Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA during 2009 compared to 2008 was due to the following: Lower results from equity affiliates ($69.1 million) primarily from our joint venture interest in Carbones del Guasare (owner and operator of the Paso Diablo Mine in Venezuela). Carbones del Guasare incurred unfavorable results in 2009 compared to 2008 (our share of which was $25.6 million) due to lower productivity, higher operating costs and ongoing labor issues; in addition, we recognized a $34.7 million impairment loss on this investment. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Lower net gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($49.7 million) was due primarily to a $54.0 million gain in the prior year from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface lands located in Kentucky. The above decreases to Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA were offset by lower costs associated with Btu Conversion activities ($16.9 million). Interest expense was lower than the prior year due to lower variable interest rates on our Term Loan Facility and accounts receivable securitization program and lower average borrowings on our Revolver. Asset retirement obligation expense decreased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the ongoing and closed mine reclamation rates reflecting lower fuel and re vegetation costs incurred in our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment. Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders The following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2009 2008 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 651.7 $ 1,179.3 $ (527.6 ) (44.7 )% Income tax provision (193.8 ) (191.4 ) (2.4 ) (1.3 )% Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes 457.9 987.9 (530.0 ) (53.6 )% Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5.1 (28.8 ) 33.9 117.7 % Net income 463.0 959.1 (496.1 ) (51.7 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (14.8 ) (6.2 ) (8.6 ) (138.7 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 448.2 $ 952.9 $ (504.7 ) (53.0 )% 44 Table of Contents Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased in 2009 compared to the prior year due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before incomes taxes discussed above. Income tax provision was impacted by the following: Increased expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the strengthening Australian dollar against the U.S dollar ($139.6 million; exchange rate rose 29% in 2009 compared to a 21% decrease in 2008, as illustrated below); and December 31, Rate Change 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate $ 0.8969 $ 0.6928 $ 0.8816 $ 0.2041 $ (0.1888 ) The prior year release of a foreign valuation allowance related to our Australian net operating loss carry forwards ($45.3 million) as a result of significantly higher earnings resulting from the higher contract pricing that was secured during 2008. The above increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower pre tax earnings in 2009, which drove a decrease to the income tax provision ($184.6 million). Income from discontinued operations increased compared to the prior year as the prior year included operating losses, net of a $26.2 million gain on the sale of our Baralaba Mine and an $11.7 million write off of a coal excise tax receivable in the first quarter of 2008. In late 2008, legislation was passed which contained provisions that allowed for the refund of coal excise tax collected on certain coal shipments. In 2009, we received a coal excise tax refund resulting in approximately $35 million, net of income taxes, recorded in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to the excise tax refund). Partially offsetting the 2009 excise tax refund were operating losses associated with discontinued operations and assets held for sale ($20.6 million) and a $10.0 million loss on the sale of our Chain Valley Mine in Australia. Outlook Near Term Outlook The World Bank estimates global economic activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), expanded 3.9% in 2010. Global GDP is projected to grow another 3.3% in 2011 and 3.6% in 2012, with developing economies, led by China and India, expanding 6% or more in each year, more than twice the growth expected for high income countries. Chinas GDP is projected by the World Bank to grow 10.0% in 2010 and 8.7% in 2011. India, the worlds second fastest growing economy, is projected by the World Bank to grow 9.5% in 2010 and 8.4% in 2011. According to the World Steel Association (WSA), global steel use was expected to increase 13.1% in 2010, followed by another 5.3% in 2011 to a record 1.3 billion tonnes. The WSA forecasts Indias steel demand would rise 8.2% in 2010 and 13.6% in 2011. Similar trends are apparent in steel production. For 2010, global steel production exceeded prior year levels by 15%, led by Asia based production (Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, China and India). Industry reports indicate China, the worlds largest steel consumer, is expected to grow its steel use 11% in 2010, and is projected to grow a further 8% to 9% in 2011. Industry reports forecast nearly 85 gigawatts of new coal fueled generation globally were due to come on line during 2010; nearly 80% of which were in China and India. New global coal fueled generation for 2010 is estimated to require approximately 290 million tons of coal annually. For 2011, approximately 90 gigawatts are expected to be under construction and or come online, requiring more than 340 million tons of coal. China and India continue to make up the vast majority. Given the pace of coal demand in the Pacific throughout 2010, coupled with late 2010 weather related demand increases in the Northern Hemisphere and supply constraints in key nations such as Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, South America and Canada, prices for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal 45 Table of Contents have been increasing. High quality, hard coking coal prices have increased from $129 per tonne for annual contracts commencing April 2009, to quarterly (April, July, October 2010) prices ranging between $200 and $225 per tonne, with January 2011 spot price exceeding $350 per tonne. Prompt index prices for Australian seaborne thermal coal rose 34% by year end 2010, and have risen another 10% as of January 18, 2011. Accordingly to the Energy Information Administrations (EIA) Short Term Energy Outlook, 2011 coal consumption, coal production and utility coal stockpiles in the U.S. are projected to be essentially on par with 2010. U.S. growth is projected to resume in 2012, with the increased consumption being matched by higher production, resulting in minimal change to utility coal stockpiles. U.S. natural gas consumption increased 5.5% and production rose approximately 4% in 2010, according to the EIA. Rising supplies combined with persistently high inventory levels have resulted in subdued gas prices. The NYMEX Henry Hub spot price averaged $4.52 per thousand cubic feet in 2010, above 2009s average $4.06 per thousand cubic feet yet 67% below the 2007 2009 average. The EIA also projects that natural gas consumption, production and storage levels will decline slightly in 2011. Like coal, natural gas consumption is expected to grow in 2012, approximately 1.6% to 66.5 billion cubic feet. The projected production decline in 2011 and higher natural gas consumption in 2012 are expected to lead to strengthening natural gas prices. As natural gas prices begin to rise, natural gas production is expected to rebound, growing approximately 2% in 2012. U.S. shale natural gas development continues in the U.S. accounting for approximately 20% of gas supply in 2010 and is estimated by the PIRA Energy Group to grow to over 30% of gas supply over the next several years. This is expected to lead to continued growth in gas fired electricity in the U.S. As of January 25, 2011, we had 7 to 8 million tons of our targeted 2011 metallurgical coal volumes and 6 to 7 million tons of our planned seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in the last three quarters of 2011. For 2012, all of our expected metallurgical coal sales and 12 to 13 million tons of our estimated seaborne thermal coal sales are available to price. In the U.S., we have modest amounts of coal to price in 2011, 35% to 40% in 2012 and 75% to 85% in 2013. We may continue to adjust our production levels in response to change in market demand. We continue to manage costs and operating performance in an effort to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic conditions and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of suboptimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Reductions in the relative cost of other fuels, including natural gas, could impact the use of coal for electricity generation. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook. We rely on ongoing access to worldwide financial markets for capital, insurance, hedging and investments through a wide variety of financial instruments and contracts. To the extent these markets are not available or increase significantly in cost, this could have a negative impact on our ability to meet our business goals. Similarly, many of our customers and suppliers rely on the availability of the financial markets to secure the necessary financing and financial surety (letters of credit, bank guarantees, performance bonds, etc.) to complete transactions with us. To the extent customers and suppliers are not able to secure this financial support, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations and or counterparty credit exposure. Dodd Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd Frank Act, which includes a number of provisions applicable to us in the areas of corporate governance, executive compensation and mine safety and extractive industries disclosure. In addition, the Dodd Frank Act imposes additional regulation 46 Table of Contents of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. Although the Dodd Frank Act became generally effective upon its enactment, many provisions have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and require further action by the federal regulatory authorities. As a result, in many respects the ultimate impact of the Dodd Frank Act on us will not be fully known for an extended period of time. We do expect that the Dodd Frank Act will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and Trading and Brokerage activities. Minerals Resource Rent Tax. On May 2, 2010, the Australian government released a report on Australias Future Tax System, which included a recommendation to replace the current resource taxing arrangements imposed on non renewable resources by the Australian federal and state governments with a uniform resource rent tax (the Resource Tax) imposed and administered by the Australian government. As proposed, the Resource Tax would be profit based and would apply to non renewable resources projects, including existing projects. On July 2, 2010, the Australian government announced changes to the Resource Tax and proposed a new minerals resource rent tax (the MRRT). The MRRT would still be profit based, but measures were introduced to lessen the impact of the MRRT. The Australian government and major industry policy makers are actively engaged to work through various structural aspects of the proposed MRRT together with detailed implementation issues. The Committee charged with consulting with industry and preparing recommendations as to the final form of the MRRT submitted its report in late December 2010. The Committees recommendations largely endorse the mining industrys understanding as to what was agreed with the federal government prior to the federal election. The Committees recommendations notwithstanding, it remains to be seen whether the federal government will adopt all recommendations, in particular the recommendation that all state royalties (current and future) are creditable against MRRT payments. MRRT is not yet law in Australia; exposure draft legislation is expected in mid 2011. Following the release of the draft legislation, industry participants will engage in further consultation with the federal government as required. The draft law is expected to be presented to the Australian Parliament in late 2011, and if the MRRT becomes law, it is intended to become effective July 1, 2012. If the MRRT were to become law, it may affect the financial performance of our Australian operations from the effective date forward. Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for the past decade. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates in its World Energy Outlook issued in November 2010, current policies scenario, that world primary energy demand will grow 47% between 2008 and 2035. Demand for coal is projected to rise 59%, outpacing the growth rate of oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro and biomass. China and India alone account for more than 85% of the 2008 2035 coal based primary energy demand growth. Under the current policies scenario, the IEA expects coal to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide. Coals share of the power generation mix was 41% in 2008. By 2035, the IEA estimates coals fuel share to be 43% as it continues to have the largest share of worldwide electric power production. Currently, we estimate approximately 390 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity generating plants are planned or under construction around the world, with expected online dates ranging between 2011 and 2015. When complete, those plants would require an estimated 1.4 billion tons of annual coal demand. In the U.S., while some planned coal based plants have been cancelled, 13 gigawatts of new coal based generating capacity have been completed in 2010 or are under construction with completion dates of 2011 2013, representing approximately 55 million tons of annual coal demand once they become operational. The IEA projects global natural gas fueled electricity generation will have a compound annual growth rate of 2.5%, from 4.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2008 to 8.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2035. The total amount of electricity generated from natural gas is expected to be approximately one half the total for coal, even in 2035. Renewables are projected to comprise 23% of the 2035 fuel mix versus 19% in 2008. Nuclear power is expected to grow 52%, however its share of total generation is expected to fall from 13.5% to 11% between 47 Table of Contents 2008 and 2035. Generation from liquid fuels is projected to decline an average of 2.2% annually to 1.5% of the 2035 generation mix. We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as CTG and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. Several CTG and CTL facilities are currently under development in China and India. We continue to support clean coal technology development toward the ultimate goal of near zero emissions, and we are advancing more than a dozen projects and partnerships in the U.S., China and Australia. In addition, clean coal technology development in the U.S. is being accelerated by funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and by the formation of an Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy to speed the commercial development of five to ten commercial CCS projects by 2016. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of CCS technologies. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash include sales of our coal production to customers, cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities, sales of non core assets and financing transactions. Along with cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity includes the available balances from our Revolver under the Credit Facility, accounts receivable securitization program and a bank overdraft facility in Australia. Our liquidity is also impacted by activity under certain bilateral cash collateralization arrangements. As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and our total available liquidity was $2.7 billion. We currently expect that our cash on hand, cash flow from operations and available liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements during the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future, as described below in Capital Requirements. In addition to the above items, alternative sources of liquidity include the ability to offer and sell certain securities under our shelf registration (as described below). In 2010, we replaced our previous $1.8 billion revolving credit facility with a $1.5 billion Revolver under a new Credit Facility (as described below). Also, additional information on our accounts receivable securitization program and bilateral cash collateralization arrangements can be found in the Off Balance Sheet Arrangements section. Credit Facility. On June 18, 2010, we entered into a Credit Agreement which established a $2.0 billion Credit Facility and replaced our third amended and restated credit agreement dated September 15, 2006. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1.5 billion Revolver and a $500.0 million term loan facility (Term Loan). We have the option to request an increase in the capacity of the Credit Facility (but no lender is obligated to increase its commitment to us), provided the aggregate increase for the Revolver and Term Loan does not exceed $250.0 million, the minimum amount of the increase is $25.0 million, and certain other conditions are met under the Credit Agreement. The Revolver also includes a swingline sub facility where up to $50.0 million is available for same day borrowings. The Revolver commitments and the Term Loan under the Credit Facility will mature on June 18, 2015. The Term Loan is subject to quarterly repayment of 1.25% per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, with the final payment of all amounts outstanding (including accrued interest) being due five years from the date of the execution of the Credit Agreement. 48 Table of Contents The Revolver replaced our previous $1.8 billion revolving credit facility and the Term Loan replaced our previous term loan facility (the previous term loan had a balance of $490.3 million at the time of replacement and at December 31, 2009). We recorded $21.9 million in deferred financing costs which are being amortized to interest expense over the five year term of the Credit Facility, and incurred refinancing charges of $9.3 million, which is classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver in 2010 or 2009, or at December 31, 2010. However, we had $67.6 million of outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2010, which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the Revolver by the same amount. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new Credit Facility. Shelf Registration. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires August 7, 2012), at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time: securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. Capital Requirements Our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, coal reserve lease and royalty payments, debt service costs (interest and principal), lease obligations, take or pay obligations and costs related to past mining obligations. Future dividends and share repurchases, among other restricted items, are subject to limitations imposed in the covenants of certain of our debt instruments. We generally fund our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2011 are anticipated to be $900 to $950 million; including $500 to $550 million earmarked for new mines, expansion and extension projects. Approximately 70% of the growth and expansion capital is targeted for various Australian projects for metallurgical and thermal coal, with the remainder in the U.S. Estimated capital expenditures also include funding for our share of construction costs for Prairie State. Prairie State. We spent $76.0 million during 2010 representing our 5.06% share of the construction costs. Included in Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, are costs of $202.5 million and $126.5 million, respectively. Our share of total construction costs for Prairie State is expected to be approximately $250 million, with most of the remaining funding expected in 2011. GreenGen. During 2010, we spent $3.1 million representing our 6.0% share of the construction costs, which is reflected as capitalized development costs as part of Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. There were no expenditures for GreenGen for 2009. Our share of total construction costs for GreenGen is expected to be approximately $60 million. Dividends. We have declared and paid quarterly dividends since our initial public offering in 2001. In January 2011, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.085 per share of common stock, payable on March 3, 2011. The declaration and payment of dividends and the amount of dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by our debt instruments and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Pension Contributions. During 2010, we made contributions of $112.6 million, which includes our estimate of required contributions for 2011 (based on current assumptions). Share Repurchase Program. At December 31, 2010, our available capacity for share repurchases was $700.4 million, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside of the share repurchase program. While no such share repurchases were made in 2010, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. 49 Table of Contents NCIG. Financing for phase one of stage two of construction closed in 2010 with us providing our pro rata share of funding of $59.7 million Australian dollars ($54.8 million U.S. dollars). NCIG may further expand the coal transloading facilitys capacity which could require us to fund our pro rata share in a similar manner. Senior Notes. On August 25, 2010, we completed a $650.0 million offering of 6.5% 10 year Senior Notes due September 2020 (the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any subordinated indebtedness; equally in right of payment with any senior indebtedness; effectively junior in right of payment to our future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and effectively junior to all the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. Interest payments are scheduled to occur on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2011. The Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by nearly all of our domestic subsidiaries, as defined in the note indenture. The note indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and lease back transactions. The Notes are redeemable at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed plus a make whole premium and any accrued unpaid interest to the redemption date. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, and cash on hand, to extinguish our previously outstanding $650.0 million aggregate principal 6.875% Senior Notes formerly due in March 2013 (the 2013 Notes). All of the 2013 Notes were either tendered or redeemed in 2010. We recognized debt extinguishment costs of $8.4 million, which are classified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The issuance of the Notes and the extinguishment of the 2013 Notes allowed us to lengthen the maturity of our senior indebtedness and lower the coupon rate. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Notes. Total Indebtedness. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, consisted of the following: December 31, 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Term Loan $ 493.8 $ 490.3 6.875% Senior Notes due March 2013 650.0 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2016 218.1 218.1 7.375% Senior Notes due November 2016 650.0 650.0 6.5% Senior Notes due September 2020 650.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026 247.2 247.1 6.34% Series B Bonds due December 2014 12.0 15.0 6.84% Series C Bonds due December 2016 33.0 33.0 Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066 373.3 371.5 Capital lease obligations 69.6 67.5 Fair value hedge adjustment 2.2 8.4 Other 0.8 1.4 Total $ 2,750.0 $ 2,752.3 We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Facility, the 5.875% Senior Notes, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 6.5% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2010. 50 Table of Contents Historical Cash Flows Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Cash Flow 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,087.1 $ 1,050.2 $ 36.9 3.5 % Net cash used in investing activities (703.6 ) (406.5 ) (297.1 ) 73.1 % Net cash used in financing activities (77.1 ) (104.6 ) 27.5 (26.3 )% Operating Activities. The changes from the prior year were driven by the following: Strong operating cash flows generated from our Australian Mining operations driven by higher volumes and pricing; partially offset by Increased margin posted for our derivative trading instruments; Lower utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program in the current year; and Higher pension payments in the current year. Investing Activities. The changes from the prior year were driven by the following: Higher current year capital spending of $296.4 million related primarily to our Bear Run Mine; Current year net cash outflows related to our pro rata share of funding for the NCIG coal transloading facility; and The collection of a note receivable of $30.0 million in the prior year; partially offset by Federal coal lease expenditures of $123.6 million in the prior year. Financing Activities. The increase compared to the prior year was primarily due to the excess tax benefits related to share based compensation of $51.0 million, partially offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $32.2 million in the current year related to our Credit Facility refinancing and the offering of the Notes. The proceeds from long term debt include $500.0 million from the Term Loan and $641.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. These proceeds were used to pay off the $490.3 million balance due on our previous term loan facility and the previously outstanding $650.0 million 2013 Notes. Other Long Term Debt. A description of our other debt instruments is described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010: Payments Due By Year Less than 2 3 4 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (Dollars in millions) Long term debt obligations (principal and interest) $ 5,621.6 $ 213.4 $ 436.6 $ 789.4 $ 4,182.2 Capital lease obligations (principal and interest) 74.6 17.0 42.1 15.5 Operating lease obligations 455.8 95.6 147.2 106.1 106.9 Unconditional purchase obligations(1) 458.2 406.7 51.5 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations 62.0 7.2 14.3 10.2 30.3 Take or pay obligations(2) 2,892.9 217.5 465.9 425.7 1,783.8 Other long term liabilities(3) 2,204.1 154.6 301.7 298.7 1,449.1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 11,769.2 $ 1,112.0 $ 1,459.3 $ 1,645.6 $ 7,552.3 51 Table of Contents (1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures relate to new mines and expansion and extension projects in Australia and the U.S. (2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal including amounts relating to export facilities. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans and mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs. We do not expect any of the $111.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization program. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements. Accounts Receivable Securitization. We have an accounts receivable securitization program (securitization program) through our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary (Seller). Under the securitization program, beginning in 2010, we contribute, on a revolving basis, trade receivables of most of our U.S. subsidiaries to the Seller, which then sells the receivables in their entirety to a consortium of unaffiliated asset backed commercial paper conduits (the Conduits). After the sale, we, as servicer of the assets, collect the receivables on behalf of the Conduits for a nominal servicing fee. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to short term borrowings under our Credit Facility, effectively managing our overall borrowing costs and providing an additional source for working capital. The securitization program was renewed in May 2009 and amended in December 2009 in order to qualify for sale accounting under a newly adopted accounting standard related to financial asset transfers. Prior to amending the securitization program, we sold senior undivided interests in certain of our accounts receivable and retained subordinated interests in those receivables. The current securitization program extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually. The Seller is a separate legal entity whose assets are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Of the receivables sold to the Conduits, a portion of the amount due to the Seller is deferred until the ultimate collection of the underlying receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received total consideration of $4,576.3 million related to accounts receivable sold under the securitization program, including $2,460.1 million of cash up front from the sale of the receivables, an additional $1,953.6 million of cash upon the collection of the underlying receivables, and $162.6 million that had not been collected at December 31, 2010 and was recorded at fair value, which approximates carrying value. The reduction in accounts receivable as a result of securitization activity with the Conduits was $150.0 million at December 31, 2010 and $254.6 million at December 31, 2009. The securitization activity has been reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activity because both the cash received from the Conduits upon sale of receivables as well as the cash received from the Conduits upon the ultimate collection of receivables are not subject to significantly different risks given the short term nature of our trade receivables. We recorded expense associated with securitization 52 Table of Contents transactions of $2.4 million, $4.0 million and $10.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. In 2010, we added standalone credit facilities with multiple banks to allow us to obtain letters of credit and bank guarantees in support of certain operations outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2010, the total capacity under these new facilities, both committed and uncommitted, was approximately $324 million, of which approximately $141 million was utilized (based on the U.S. dollar exchange rate at December 31, 2010). Also during 2010, we entered into a bilateral cash collateralized agreement in support of certain letters of credit whereby we posted cash collateral in lieu of utilizing our Credit Facility. Such cash collateral is classified within cash and cash equivalents given our ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are also required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Postretirement Benefit and Pension Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 11 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 for pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $115.6 million, while funding payments were $187.9 million. Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities. We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts. Health care cost trend rate: One Percentage One Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 7.8 $ (6.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ 112.5 $ (94.4 ) 53 Table of Contents Discount rate: One Half One Half Percentage Percentage Point Increase Point Decrease (Dollars in millions) Effect on total service and interest cost components(1) $ 0.6 $ (0.6 ) Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1) $ (51.1 ) $ 58.8 (1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 11.93 years at December 31, 2010. Asset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $48.5 million, and payments totaled $14.1 million. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ. Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three level hierarchy, Levels 1, 2 and 3. Level 3 fair value measurements are those where inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants. Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include 54 Table of Contents forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities. We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 3% and 5%, respectively, of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements. Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet Implemented See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives or currency hedging portfolios. A description of each market risk category is set forth below. We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio. Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price Risk We engage in direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities in over the counter markets (coal trading). These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of total exposure, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time. We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. We perform a VaR analysis on our coal trading portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter and brokerage coal trading. The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the potential loss in value of our mark to market portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model assumes a 5 to 15 day holding period and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical 55 Table of Contents chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not capture the loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR. The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk. In 2010, we modified our VaR methodology to be in line with our global trading strategy. The previous methodology used an additive approach whereby the domestic portfolio and the international portfolio were calculated separately and then added together to arrive at our total global VaR. The new methodology explicitly considers correlation measures between the domestic and the international portfolios to consolidate our total global VaR. The high, low and average VaR for the year ended December 31, 2010 is set forth in the table below under the previous and new methodology : Year Ended December 31, 2010 Low High Average (Dollars in millions) Previous Methodology $ 4.5 $ 37.6 $ 10.1 New Methodology $ 3.4 $ 18.8 $ 7.0 As of December 31, 2010, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows: Year of Percentage of Expiration Portfolio Total 2011 70 % 2012 21 % 2013 3 % 2014 4 % 2015 2 % 100 % We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance. Nonperformance and Credit Risk Coal Trading. The fair value of our coal trading assets and liabilities reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our exposure is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral (margin), requiring prepayments for shipments or the 56 Table of Contents creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions. Non Coal Trading. The fair value of our non coal trading derivative assets and liabilities also reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. We conduct our hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks and closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. To reduce our credit exposure for these hedging activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.10 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $208 million for 2011. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $60 million for 2011. The table at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2010. Interest Rate Risk Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we manage our debt to achieve a certain ratio of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, we had $2.3 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $0.5 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding and had no interest rate swaps in place. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $5 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $163 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings. Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price Risk Long term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. Sales under such agreements comprised approximately 91%, 93% and 90% of our worldwide sales (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Substantially all of our coal in the U.S is contracted in 2011 at planned production levels. We had 13 to 15 million tons remaining to be priced for 2011 in Australia at January 25, 2011. Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of cost pass through contracts and derivatives, primarily swaps. Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 145 to 150 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2011. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $36 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $14 million. 57 Table of Contents Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 355,000 to 365,000 tons of explosives during 2011 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $6 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $2 million. Notional Amounts and Fair Value. The following summarizes our interest rate, foreign currency and commodity positions at December 31, 2010: Notional Amount by Year of Maturity Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 and thereafter Foreign Currency A$:US$ hedge contracts (A$ millions) $ 4,187.5 $ 1,484.2 $ 1,355.2 $ 926.6 $ 421.5 $ $ Commodity Contracts Diesel fuel hedge contracts (million gallons) 191.4 89.5 76.2 25.7 U.S. explosives hedge contracts (million MMBtu) 8.4 3.9 3.0 1.5 Account Classification by Cash flow Fair value Economic Fair Value Asset hedge hedge hedge (Liability) (Dollars in millions) Foreign Currency A$:US$ hedge contracts (A$ millions) $ 4,187.5 $ $ $ 640.1 Commodity Contracts Diesel fuel hedge contracts (million gallons) 191.4 $ 40.3 U.S. explosives hedge contracts (million MMBtu) 8.4 $ (0.1 )
