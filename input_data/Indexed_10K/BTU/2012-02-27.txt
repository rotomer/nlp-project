Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Share RepurchasesOn October 24, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. While no such share repurchases were made in 2011, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer also has the authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside the share repurchase program. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be discontinued at any time. Through December 31, 2011, we have made repurchases of 7.7 million shares at a cost of $299.6 million ($199.8 million and $99.8 million in 2008 and 2006, respectively), leaving $700.4 million available for share repurchases under the share repurchase program.The following table summarizes all share repurchases for the three months ended December 31, 2011:PeriodTotalNumber ofShares Purchased(1) AveragePrice per Share Total Number ofShares Purchasedas Part of PubliclyAnnounced Program Maximum DollarValue that May YetBe Used toRepurchaseShares Under thePublicly Announced Program (In millions)October 1 through October 31, 201152,685 $45.27 $700.4November 1 through November 30, 20114,157 36.06 700.4December 1 through December 31, 2011 700.4Total56,842 $44.60 (1) Represents shares withheld to cover the withholding taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock, which are not a part of the share repurchase program.Item 6. Selected Financial Data. The following table presents selected financial and other data about us for the most recent five fiscal years. The following table and the discussion of our results of operations in 2011, 2010 and 2009 in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as reflected at the end of Item 6. Selected Financial Data and in Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements.The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations those operations recently divested, as well as certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets.37Table of ContentsOn October 26, 2011, we acquired Macarthur. Our results of operations include Macarthurs results of operations from the date of acquisition. Macarthurs results are reflected in our Australian Mining Segment. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 from our audited financial statements. You should read the following table in conjunction with the financial statements, the related notes to those financial statements and Item 7.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.OverviewWe are the worlds largest private sector coal company. We own interests in 30 coal mining operations, including a majority interest in 29 coal operations located in the U.S. and Australia and a 50% equity interest in the Middlemount Mine in Australia. We also own an equity interest in a joint venture mining operation in Venezuela. In 2011, we produced 227.5 million tons of coal from continuing operations and sold 250.6 million tons of coal.We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining segment consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal. On October 26, 2011, we acquired Macarthur. Our results of operations include Macarthurs results of operations from the date of acquisition. Macarthurs results are reflected in our Australian Mining Segment. In the U.S., we typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). Our Australia Mining operations are primarily export focused with customers spread across several countries, while a portion of our coal is sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Generally, Australian revenues from individual countries vary year by year based on the demand for electricity, the demand for steel, the strength of the global economy and several other factors including those specific to each country. Historically in Australia Mining operations, we predominately entered into multi year international coal agreements that contained provisions allowing either party to commence a renegotiation of the agreement price annually in the second quarter of each year. Current industry practice, and our practice, is to negotiate pricing for metallurgical coal contracts quarterly and seaborne thermal coal contracts annually. During 2011, approximately 91% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2011, 82% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 15% were to customers outside the U.S. and 3% were to the U.S. industrial sector.Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations.Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, Btu Conversion activities, as well as the optimization of our coal reserve and real estate holdings.To maximize our coal assets and land holdings for long term growth, we are contributing to the development of coal fueled generation, pursuing Btu Conversion projects that would convert coal to natural gas or transportation fuels and advancing clean coal technologies, including CCS.39Table of ContentsAs discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by weather conditions, cost of competing fuels, availability of transportation for coal shipments, labor relations, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the pace of the economic recovery. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand.Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 SummaryGlobal coal consumption rose to an estimated 7.7 billion tonnes in 2011 driven by increased coal use in China, India and other developing Asian nations. Global seaborne demand rose an estimated 6% and exceeded 1 billion tonnes, led by an increase in thermal demand to supply new coal fueled electricity generation brought on line in 2011. Global steel production grew an estimated 7% while China and Indias coal fueled electricity generation rose 14% and 9%, respectively, in 2011.In the U.S., coal markets have been impacted by a weak economy, low electricity generation and depressed near term natural gas prices. U.S. coal electricity generation declined an estimated 6% in 2011 while U.S. coal exports increased 28% to an estimated 108 million tons.Our revenues increased compared to the prior year by $1,234.5 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year by $372.8 million, led by higher average prices in all regions and increased volume in the U.S.Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to the prior year by $183.9 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and increased income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest expense.We ended the year with total available liquidity of $2.3 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources.Tons SoldThe following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 Tons % (Tons in millions)Western U.S. Mining173.6 163.8 9.8 6.0 %Midwestern U.S. Mining30.3 29.7 0.6 2.0 %Australian Mining25.3 25.3 %Trading and Brokerage21.4 25.4 (4.0) (15.7)%Total tons sold250.6 244.2 6.4 2.6 %40Table of ContentsRevenuesThe following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Revenues 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Western U.S. Mining$2,900.4 $2,706.3 $194.1 7.2%Midwestern U.S. Mining1,481.1 1,320.6 160.5 12.2%Australian Mining3,080.7 2,399.9 680.8 28.4%Trading and Brokerage475.1 291.1 184.0 63.2%Corporate and Other37.1 22.0 15.1 68.6%Total revenues$7,974.4 $6,739.9 $1,234.5 18.3%The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues compared to the prior year was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 26.5%, led by increased pricing for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal due to a combination of increased global coal demand and coal supply constraints resulting from weather impacts in early 2011. In 2011, Macarthur operations contributed revenues of $152.9 million on 0.9 million tons sold. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower metallurgical volumes due to a third quarter roof fall and recovery of longwall operations at our North Goonyella Mine and flooding in Queensland that began in late 2010 that lowered production and shipments in the first quarter of 2011. Metallurgical coal sales totaled 9.3 million tons in 2011 as compared to 9.8 million tons in 2010.Western U.S. Mining operations revenues were higher compared to the prior year as volumes and the weighted average sales price were above the prior year. The volume increase of 6.0% was led by increased shipments from our Powder River Basin region due to increased customer demand. Our weighted average sales price rose modestly compared to the prior year (1.2%) as favorable contract pricing in our Southwest region was partially offset by lower pricing in the Powder River Basin region due to a combination of sales mix and the expiration of some higher priced, long term contracts signed before the economic recession in the 2008 and 2009 timeframe.Trading and Brokerage revenues were higher compared to the prior year due to an increase in export volumes, which carry higher prices, and higher overall coal market pricing on our brokerage activity, partially offset by lower domestic volumes. In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements compared to the prior year were due to a higher weighted average sales price of 9.8% driven by favorable contracts signed in recent years. Volumes were also higher (2.0%) due to incremental contributions from our Bear Run Mine (which commenced operations in May 2010) and Wild Boar Mine (which commenced operations in December 2010).Segment Adjusted EBITDAThe following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) toSegment Adjusted EBITDA 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$766.0 $816.7 $(50.7) (6.2)%Midwestern U.S. Mining408.9 322.1 86.8 26.9 %Australian Mining1,194.3 977.4 216.9 22.2 %Trading and Brokerage197.0 77.2 119.8 155.2 %Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,566.2 $2,193.4 $372.8 17.0 %41Table of ContentsAustralian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to a higher weighted average sales price ($742.6 million), partially offset by lower production and higher costs at our North Goonyella Mine due to a roof fall and recovery of longwall operations ($234.7 million), an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($135.8 million), cost escalations for labor, materials and services ($64.0 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced coal shipments ($54.1 million) and lower volumes ($38.1 million), excluding the impact of the North Goonyella roof fall discussed above.Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to higher margins on our brokerage activity due to higher prices as discussed above. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to a higher weighted average sales price ($112.5 million), partially offset by increased labor ($17.7 million) and materials and services costs ($12.4 million) related primarily to compliance measures at our underground mines. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased as compared to the prior year due to higher volume driven labor ($39.1 million) and materials and services costs ($31.3 million), increased equipment repairs and maintenance costs ($33.1 million), a provision related to litigation recorded in the second quarter of 2011 ($24.5 million), and increased commodity costs, net of hedging ($16.1 million). The above decreases to the segments Adjusted EBITDA were partially offset by increased volumes ($88.0 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($41.6 million) as discussed above.Income From Continuing Operations Before Income TaxesThe following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,566.2 $2,193.4 $372.8 17.0%Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1)(437.5) (354.7) (82.8) 23.3%Depreciation, depletion and amortization(482.2) (437.1) (45.1) 10.3%Asset retirement obligation expense(53.1) (47.2) (5.9) 12.5%Interest expense(238.6) (222.0) (16.6) 7.5%Interest income18.9 9.6 9.3 96.9%Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,373.7 $1,142.0 $231.7 20.3%(1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, certain asset sales, resource management costs and revenues, coal royalty expense, costs associated with past mining activities, expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion costs and provisions for certain litigation.Income from continuing operations before income taxes was greater than the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest expense.Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA reflects higher expenses compared to the prior year due primarily to the following:Higher current year expenses in support of our international expansion, acquisition activity and other growth initiatives, including $85.2 million of expenses associated with the acquisition of Macarthur; andLower current year results from equity affiliates ($17.5 million) due to current year losses associated with our joint venture arrangement in Australia ($7.3 million) and earnings recognized in the prior year associated with transaction services related to our Mongolian joint venture ($10.0 million); partially offset byIncreased gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($46.9 million) driven by current year non cash exchanges of coal reserves in Kentucky and coal reserves and surface lands in Illinois for coal reserves in West Virginia ($37.7 million) and current year gains of $31.7 million associated with sales of non strategic coal reserves in Kentucky and Illinois, partially offset by prior year gains associated with non cash exchanges of coal reserves in Kentucky and coal reserves and surface lands in Illinois for coal reserves in West Virginia ($23.7 million); and 42Table of ContentsA current year gain associated with the receipt of a $14.6 million project development fee related to our involvement in Prairie State. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased compared to the prior year primarily driven by additional expense associated with the assets acquired in the Macarthur acquisition.Interest expense increased $16.6 million over the prior year due primarily to current year acquisition related interest expense of $45.3 million, which includes $29.1 million of expense related to ongoing financing and $16.2 million of expense for bridge financing, partially offset by costs in the prior year of $9.3 million associated with the refinancing of our five year Credit Facility and $8.4 million of charges associated with the extinguishment of $650.0 million of senior notes.Net Income Attributable to Common StockholdersThe following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,373.7 $1,142.0 $231.7 20.3 %Income tax provision363.2 315.4 47.8 15.2 %Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes1,010.5 826.6 183.9 22.2 %Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes(64.2) (24.4) (39.8) 163.1 %Net income946.3 802.2 144.1 18.0 %Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests(11.4) 28.2 (39.6) (140.4)%Net income attributable to common stockholders$957.7 $774.0 $183.7 23.7 %Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to the prior year due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above.The provision for income taxes increased compared to the prior year due to higher current year earnings ($81.1 million), a change in valuation allowances ($44.1 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits released in the prior year and higher current year state income taxes ($17.1 million). The increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower current year foreign earnings repatriation expense ($76.9 million) and a current year benefit of $0.9 million associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as compared to remeasurement expense of $47.9 million in the prior year as the Australian exchange rate decreased against the U.S. dollar in the current year as compared to an increase in the prior year, as set forth in the table below.

This decrease is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.43Table of ContentsThe fair value of our coal trading positions, before the application of margin, designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sales changed from a liability of $174.2 million at December 31, 2010 to a liability of $22.4 million at December 31, 2011 due to favorable market price movements on our positions held and realization of completed transactions.Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 SummaryIn the U.S., demand for coal rose approximately 75 million tons in 2010, led by a 5.5% increase in coal fueled generation and an 18 million ton rise in exports. The international coal markets strengthened in 2010 due to strong Asian demand growth and weather related generation recovery in the Atlantic markets, coupled with supply challenges across the major coal exporting nations of the Southern Hemisphere. Our analyses of general business conditions indicate the following:Seaborne coal demand increased an estimated 13% in 2010, led by a 32% recovery in global metallurgical coal demand;Pacific thermal coal demand for electricity generation rose 15% in 2010, while the Atlantic market declined 10%;Benchmark pricing of high quality, hard coking coal in the seaborne market has ranged between $200 to $225 per tonne from April to December 2010;The benchmark prompt seaborne thermal coal price in Newcastle, Australia rose 34% in 2010;U.S. coal generation accounted for nearly two thirds of the growth in total power output in 2010 due to new coal fueled generation, favorable weather, and a partial reversal of 2009s coal to gas switching; andIndexed U.S. coal prices rose in 2010 in all regions, with increases ranging from 30 to 50%.Our 2010 revenues increased compared to 2009 by $892.9 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over 2009 by $586.1 million, led by higher Australian pricing and sales volumes in 2010 despite unfavorable weather related volume impacts that occurred late in 2010.Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to 2009 by $383.4 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by increased income taxes, decreased Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and interest expense.We ended 2010 with total available liquidity of $2.7 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources.Tons SoldThe following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining163.8 160.1 3.7 2.3 %Midwestern U.S. Mining29.7 31.8 (2.1) (6.6)%Australian Mining25.3 20.0 5.3 26.5 %Trading and Brokerage25.4 29.4 (4.0) (13.6)%Total tons sold244.2 241.3 2.9 1.2 %44Table of ContentsRevenuesThe following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Revenues 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$2,706.3 $2,612.6 $93.7 3.6 %Midwestern U.S. Mining1,320.6 1,303.8 16.8 1.3 %Australian Mining2,399.9 1,512.6 887.3 58.7 %Trading and Brokerage291.1 391.0 (99.9) (25.5)%Corporate and Other22.0 27.0 (5.0) (18.5)%Total revenues$6,739.9 $5,847.0 $892.9 15.3 %The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 25.4%, led by increased pricing on seaborne metallurgical and thermal coals and a higher mix of metallurgical coal shipments. Volumes also increased in 2010 (26.5%) driven by increased demand for metallurgical coal (metallurgical coal shipments of 9.8 million tons were 2.9 million tons, or 42.0%, greater than 2009). These increases were muted to an extent by the flooding in Queensland in late 2010 that negatively impacted our production and also restricted throughput due to damage to the port and rail systems. The metallurgical coal demand increase reflects the strengthening of the coal markets as discussed above, coupled with 2009 customer destocking of inventory and lower capacity utilization at steel customers.Western U.S. Mining operations revenues increased compared to 2009 due to increased sales volume (2.3%) driven by our Powder River Basin and Southwest regions due to increased customer demand and a higher weighted average sales price of 1.3%.In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements due to an increase in our weighted average sales price of 8.4% from contractual price increases were largely offset by decreased shipments (6.6%) on lower customer demand.Trading and Brokerage revenues were down primarily due to lower international brokerage revenues, unfavorable market movements on freight positions that support our export volumes and weather related shipment deferrals.Segment Adjusted EBITDAThe following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$816.7 $721.5 $95.2 13.2 %Midwestern U.S. Mining322.1 281.9 40.2 14.3 %Australian Mining977.4 410.5 566.9 138.1 %Trading and Brokerage77.2 193.4 (116.2) (60.1)%Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,193.4 $1,607.3 $586.1 36.5 %Our Australian Mining segment benefited from a higher weighted average sales price ($408.3 million) and increased volumes ($134.0 million) as discussed above, and productivity improvements at our North Goonyella and Wambo underground mines along with fewer longwall move days in 2010 ($116.0 million). Partially offsetting the above improvements were net higher adverse weather impacts driven by the flooding in late 2010, unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($34.5 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced metallurgical coal shipments ($31.7 million) and increased demurrage costs ($10.7 million).45Table of ContentsWestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to 2009 due to the higher volumes ($49.8 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($42.1 million) discussed above, lower repairs and maintenance costs due to timing of repairs and improved equipment efficiency ($35.0 million) and fewer longwall move days at our Twentymile Mine in 2010 ($10.0 million), partially offset by 2009 customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million) and increased commodity costs in the 2010 ($20.8 million).In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, a higher weighted average sales price ($98.5 million), as discussed above, was partially offset by lower volumes ($42.3 million) due to decreased demand and increased costs on lower productivity due to compliance measures and geological conditions at certain underground mines.Our Trading and Brokerage segment was down primarily due to the lower revenues as discussed above.Income From Continuing Operations Before Income TaxesThe following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,193.4 $1,607.3 $586.1 36.5%Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1)(354.7) (344.5) (10.2) 3.0%Depreciation, depletion and amortization(437.1) (400.5) (36.6) 9.1%Asset retirement obligation expense(47.2) (39.9) (7.3) 18.3%Interest expense(222.0) (201.1) (20.9) 10.4%Interest income9.6 8.1 1.5 18.5%Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,142.0 $629.4 $512.6 81.4%(1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, certain asset sales, resource management costs and revenue, coal royalty expense, costs associated with past mining obligations, expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion costs and provision for certain litigation.Income from continuing operations before income taxes was higher compared to 2009 primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense as discussed below:Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA: higher expense was primarily driven by an increase in selling and administrative expenses due to costs to support our business development and international expansion (e.g. headcount, travel, professional services, legal). We also incurred increased post mining costs driven by higher retiree healthcare amortization of actuarial losses and interest cost. These items were partially offset by improved results from equity affiliates primarily due to 2009 losses of $54.6 million related to our equity investment in Carbones del Guasare, which included a $34.7 million impairment loss and $19.9 million of operating losses. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.Depreciation, depletion and amortization: higher compared to 2009 due to increased production at our Australian mines with higher per ton depletion rates reflecting higher demand and additional depreciation expense associated with our new Bear Run Mine (commissioned in the second quarter of 2010).Interest expense: higher primarily due to refinancing charges ($9.3 million) associated with our new five year Credit Facility and charges ($8.4 million) associated with the extinguishment and refinancing of $650.0 million of senior notes.46Table of ContentsNet Income Attributable to Common StockholdersThe following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,142.0 $629.4 $512.6 81.4 %Income tax provision315.4 186.2 129.2 69.4 %Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes826.6 443.2 383.4 86.5 %(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes(24.4) 19.8 (44.2) (223.2)%Net income802.2 463.0 339.2 73.3 %Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests28.2 14.8 13.4 90.5 %Net income attributable to common stockholders$774.0 $448.2 $325.8 72.7 %Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to 2009 due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above.Income tax provision was impacted by the following:Increased expense due to higher earnings ($179.4 million) and income tax resulting from foreign earnings repatriation ($84.5 million), partially offset byA change in the valuation allowance ($46.0 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits, lower expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the larger increase in the Australian exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in 2009 compared to 2010 ($26.5 million) as set forth in the table below, the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in 2010 ($41.1 million), and lower expense in 2010 due to the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination of the 2005 federal income tax year ($15.2 million).

The increase is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Outlook Our near term outlook is intended to address the next 12 24 months, with any subsequent periods addressed in our long term outlook. 47Table of ContentsNear Term Outlook Global coal consumption rose in 2011 to an estimated 7.7 billion tonnes, driven by increased coal use in China, India and other developing Asian nations. Global seaborne demand rose an estimated 6% and exceeded 1 billion tonnes, led by an increase in thermal demand to supply approximately 81 gigawatts of new coal fueled electricity generation brought on line in 2011. In the U.S., coal markets have been marked by a weak economy, low electricity generation and depressed near term natural gas prices. U.S. coal electricity generation declined an estimated 6% in 2011 driven by more mild weather as compared to the prior year as well as some displacement from hydro and natural gas, while U.S. coal exports increased 28% to an estimated 108 million tons.The International Monetary Funds January 2012 World Economic Outlook estimates global economic activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), will grow 3.3% in 2012 and 3.9% in 2013, led by China and India. Chinas GDP is projected to grow 8.2% in 2012 and 8.8% in 2013. India, the worlds second fastest growing economy, is projected to grow 7.0% in 2012 and 7.3% in 2013.According to the World Steel Association, global steel use is expected to increase 5.4% in 2012, with China expected to grow its steel use by 6.0%.Prices for global seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal have come down from record highs during 2011, though recent settlements have still been higher than historical averages. Metallurgical coal prices for high quality hard coking coal and LV PCI settled at $235 and $171 per tonne, respectively, for quarterly contracts commencing January 2012. We have settled first quarter metallurgical coal shipments in line with these recent settlements, with essentially all remaining 2012 metallurgical coal production unpriced. We expect near term macroeconomic movements to dictate quarterly pricing for the remainder of 2012 and we are targeting total 2012 metallurgical coal sales of approximately 14 to 15 million tons.Seaborne thermal coal originating from Newcastle, Australia, has been settled for annual contracts beginning in January 2012 at $116 per tonne. As of January 24, 2012, we had 40% to 50% of 2012 seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in Australia and we are targeting 2012 Australian thermal exports of 12 to 13 million tons.Looking at U.S. markets, the Energy Information Administrations (EIA) February 2012 Short Term Energy Outlook projects 2012 U.S. electric power coal consumption to decline by approximately 2%. U.S. coal production is also expected to decline by 2%, despite slight production expansion in the Western region. U.S. producers will look to increase exports as domestic markets remain weak relative to historic levels and global seaborne thermal markets provide growing sales opportunities.The coal fueled electric power generation decline in 2012 is projected to be primarily driven by depressed near term natural gas prices that are resulting in elevated levels of coal to gas switching, with the largest impact projected to be on Central Appalachian coal supply. If coal to gas switching lasts for a prolonged period during 2012 due to significantly depressed natural gas prices, there may be more substantial unfavorable impacts to all coal supply regions, including the Powder River Basin. We continually adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand.We are targeting our U.S. volumes in 2012 to be on par with prior year levels and are fully committed on pricing. As of January 24, 2012, we had 45% to 55% of planned U.S. production unpriced for 2013. As a result of the current weak U.S. coal market environment, some customers may attempt to delay and or cancel portions of contracted 2012 volumes. Our coal supply agreement contractual terms and conditions provide support for us to seek full performance from all customers. In selected cases, we may elect to reach agreement with customers on monetary settlements and or contract extensions for 2013 and beyond in exchange for relief on 2012 volumes. Macarthur is expected to contribute less than $100 million of EBITDA in 2012 given the significant cost increases necessary to correct overburden deficiencies at the Coppabella Mine and to complete major repairs at both the Coppabella and Moorvale mines that had been deferred under previous management. We expect that these expenditures will allow us to enter 2013 with a solid foundation for higher productivity, lower costs, and improved financial performance. In addition, we expect to incur increased depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2012 and beyond driven by a higher average depletion rate associated with the acquisition of Macarthur. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources our debt service cost will also increase as a result of the debt incurred to fund the acquisition of Macarthur.48Table of ContentsWe continue to manage costs and operating performance in an effort to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic issues and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of suboptimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Reductions in the relative cost of other fuels, including natural gas, could impact the use of coal for electricity generation. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook.Dodd Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd Frank Act was enacted, which includes a number of provisions applicable to us in the areas of corporate governance, executive compensation and mine safety and extractive industries disclosure. In addition, the Dodd Frank Act imposes additional regulation of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. Although the Dodd Frank Act generally became effective upon its enactment, many provisions have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and require further action by the federal regulatory authorities. As a result, the ultimate impact of the Dodd Frank Act on us will not be fully known for an extended period of time. We do expect that the Dodd Frank Act will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and Trading and Brokerage activities.European Union Derivatives Regulation. In October 2011, the European Commission adopted proposals to revise its directive on markets in financial instruments (MiFID) and to enact a new regulation on markets in financial instruments (MiFIR). These proposals, which are currently under negotiation by the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, will likely impose additional regulation of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. While the ultimate impact of these proposals will not be known for some time, we do expect that they will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities.Minerals Resource Rent Tax. On May 2, 2010, the Australian government released a report on Australias Future Tax System, which included a recommendation to replace the current resource taxing arrangements imposed on non renewable resources by the Australian federal and state governments with a super profit resource rent tax (the Resource Tax) imposed and administered by the Australian government. As proposed, the Resource Tax would be profit based and would apply to non renewable resources projects, including existing projects. On July 2, 2010, the Australian government announced changes to the Resource Tax and proposed a new minerals resource rent tax (the MRRT). The MRRT would still be profit based, but measures were introduced to lessen the impact of the MRRT. The Australian government and major industry policy makers are actively engaged to work through various structural aspects of the proposed MRRT together with detailed implementation issues. A committee charged with consulting with industry and preparing recommendations as to the final form of the MRRT submitted its report in late December 2010. That committees recommendations largely endorsed the mining industrys understanding as to what was agreed with the federal government prior to the federal election. In March 2011, those recommendations were accepted by the federal government, which included the recommendation that all state royalties (current and future) are creditable against MRRT payments. An implementation group was formed, which included industry participants, to assist with drafting the legislation. Draft legislation and an accompanying explanatory memorandum was released for public consultation on June 7, 2011. The final exposure draft was released for further consultation on September 16, 2011 with legislation formally submitted to the House of Representatives in November 2011. The legislation was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on November 21, 2011 with the committee due to report back to the Senate on March 14, 2012. If the MRRT becomes law, the MRRT will apply to mining profits attributable to the value of resources earned after July 1, 2012 and may affect the level of taxation incurred by our Australian operations going forward.Carbon Pricing Framework. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Australian government passed a legislative package that included a carbon pricing framework that commences July 1, 2012. The carbon price will initially be $23.00 Australian dollars per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, escalated by 2.5% per year for inflation over a three year period. After June 30, 2015, the carbon price mechanism will transition to an emissions trading scheme. We believe that all of our Australian operations will be impacted by the fugitive emissions portion of the framework (defined as the methane and carbon dioxide which escapes into the atmosphere when coal is mined and gas is produced), which we estimate will initially average $2.00 to $3.25 Australian dollars per tonne of coal produced annually. Actual results will be dependent upon the volume of tons produced at each of our mining locations as the impact per tonne at our surface mines will generally be less than the impact per tonne at our underground mines. In addition, our Australian mines will be impacted by the phased reduction of the governments diesel fuel rebate to capture emissions from fuel combustion. Our North Goonyella, Wambo and Metropolitan mines will be eligible to apply for a portion of the governments approximately $1.3 billion Australian dollars of transition benefits that would provide assistance based on historical emissions intensity data to the most emissions intensive coal mines over a six year period.49Table of ContentsCross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). On July 6, 2011, the U.S. EPA finalized CSAPR, which requires 28 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and or fine particle pollution in other states. The CSAPR is one of a number of significant regulations that the EPA has issued or expects to issue that will impose more stringent requirements relating to air, water and waste controls on electric generating units. Under the CSAPR, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions would commence in 2012 with further reductions effective in 2014. In October 2011, the EPA proposed amendments to the CSAPR to increase emission budgets in ten states, including Texas, and ease limits on market based compliance options. While CSAPR had an initial compliance deadline of January 1, 2012, the rule was challenged and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed CSAPR and advised that the EPA is expected to continue administering CAIR until the pending challenges are resolved. Expedited briefing on the merits of the challenge is underway. We continue to evaluate the possible scenarios associated with the CSAPR and the impacts it may have on our business and our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2011, coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for the past decade.The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates in its World Energy Outlook 2011, current policies scenario, that world primary energy demand will grow 51% between 2009 and 2035. Demand for coal is projected to rise 65%, and the growth in global electricity generation from coal is expected to be greater than the growth in oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, biomass, geothermal and solar combined. China and India account for more than 75% of the 2009 2035 coal based primary energy demand growth. Under the current policies scenario, the IEA expects coal to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide. Coals share of the power generation mix was 47% in 2009. By 2035, the IEA estimates coals fuel share of power generation to be 49% as it continues to have the largest share of worldwide electric power production. According to industry reports, approximately 370 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity generating plants are currently planned or under construction around the world with expected completion between 2012 and 2016. Based on those estimates, when complete, those plants would require an estimated 1.2 billion tonnes of coal annually. In the U.S., while coal based plant retirements are expected, the EIA is projecting coal demand to remain relatively constant through 2015. The IEA projects that global natural gas fueled electricity generation will have a compound annual growth rate of 2.7%, from 4.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2009 to 8.7 trillion kilowatt hours in 2035. The total amount of electricity generated from natural gas is expected to be approximately one half the total for coal, even in 2035. Renewables are projected to comprise 23% of the 2035 fuel mix versus 19% in 2009. Nuclear power is expected to grow 50%, however its share of total generation is expected to fall from 13.5% to 10% between 2009 and 2035. The recent events in Japan and Germany may impact these projections. Generation from liquid fuels is projected to decline an average of 2.1% annually to 1.5% of the 2035 generation mix.We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as coal to gas (CTG) and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. Several CTG and CTL facilities are currently under development in China and India. We continue to support clean coal technology development toward the ultimate goal of near zero emissions, and we are advancing more than a dozen projects and partnerships in the U.S., China and Australia. Clean coal technology development in the U.S. has funding earmarked under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In addition, the Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage was formed to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy surrounding the commercial development of commercial carbon capture and storage projects. Our work in new or recently commercialized technologies could expose us to unanticipated risks, evolving legislation and uncertainty regarding the extent of future government support and funding.Our long term plans also include advancing projects to expand our presence in the Asia Pacific region, some of which include sourcing coal to be sold through our Trading and Brokerage segment and partnerships to utilize our mining experience for joint mine development. In July 2011, we entered into a framework agreement to pursue development of a 50 million ton per year surface mine in Xinjiang, China. Also in July 2011, we were selected to be part of a consortium to develop the Tavan Tolgoi coking coal reserve in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The Government of Mongolia continues to evaluate the structure and components of the mine development, and we are negotiating with other parties and the Government of Mongolia regarding long term agreements related to the project. Any agreements would then be submitted for consideration and approval by government agencies and the Parliament of Mongolia.50Table of ContentsEnactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in, the state of commercial development and deployment of CCS technologies and the alternative markets for coal. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital ResourcesOur primary sources of cash are the sales of our coal production to customers and from the cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities. To a lesser extent, we also generate cash from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface land and from financing transactions. Along with cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity includes the available balances from our Revolver under our Credit Facility, an accounts receivable securitization program and a bank overdraft facility in Australia. Our available liquidity as of December 31, 2011 was $2.3 billion, which included cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 billion, $1.5 billion available for borrowing under the Revolver, net of outstanding letters of credit of $21.0 million, and available capacity under our accounts receivable securitization program of $41.7 million, net of outstanding letters of credit and amounts drawn. Our liquidity is also impacted by activity under certain bilateral cash collateralization arrangements. We assumed Macarthurs three year $330.0 million Australian dollar Corporate Funding Facility (Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility) as part of the acquisition that has a maturity date of November 30, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings under the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility. The Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility has a $130.0 million Australian dollar sub limit for bank guarantees, leaving an available capacity of $200.0 million Australian dollars at December 31, 2011. Letters of credit and cash backed bank guarantees totaling $65.0 million Australian dollars were outstanding as of December 31, 2011. We plan to terminate the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility in 2012.As of December 31, 2011, approximately $284 million of our cash was held in the U.S. with approximately $515 million held by foreign subsidiaries, primarily those in our Australia Mining segment. Nearly all of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars and is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. The cash held in Australia is currently expected to be used to fund, in part, our organic growth projects, sustaining capital expenditures and existing operations. We currently expect that our available liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements during the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. In addition to the above, alternative sources of liquidity include our ability to offer and sell securities under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC. Capital RequirementsOur primary uses of cash include the cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, coal reserve lease and royalty payments, debt service costs (interest and principal), lease obligations, take or pay obligations and costs related to past mining obligations. When in compliance with the financial covenants and customary default provisions of our Credit Facility and 2011 Term Loan Facility, we are not restricted in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase capital stock provided that we may only redeem and repurchase capital stock with the proceeds received from the concurrent issue of capital stock or indebtedness permitted under the Credit Facility and 2011 Term Loan Facility.Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2012 are anticipated to be $1.2 to $1.4 billion. Approximately $800 to $950 million is earmarked for growth projects that encompass future mine development, as well as the expansion and extension of existing mines, with much of the remaining allocated to sustaining capital expenditures for existing operations. The increase in planned capital expenditures for 2012 compared to 2011 is due to the continued advancement of multiple organic growth projects at our Millennium, Metropolitan and Burton mines. Approximately 75% of the growth and expansion capital is targeted for various Australian projects for metallurgical and thermal coal, with the remainder in the U.S. Our 2012 capital expenditures will include spending to begin converting two of our Australian mines from contract mining to owner operations. 51Table of ContentsFederal Coal Lease Expenditures. We currently anticipate that our federal coal lease expenditures will be $42.1 million in 2012 and for each of the next three years. These expenditures may increase in 2012 and beyond depending upon our participation in and the successful bidding on future federal coal leases.Dividends. We have declared and paid quarterly dividends since our initial public offering in 2001. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.085 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2012. The declaration and payment of dividends and the amount of dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by our debt instruments and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.Pension Contributions. During 2011, we made contributions of $46.7 million. In 2012, our anticipated pension contributions needed to be at or above the Pension Protection Act thresholds is approximately $5 million.Share Repurchase Program. At December 31, 2011, our available capacity for share repurchases was $700.4 million, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside of the share repurchase program. While no such share repurchases were made in 2011, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options.NCIG. Financing for phase one of stage two of construction closed in 2010 with us providing our pro rata share of funding of $59.7 million Australian dollars ($54.8 million U.S. dollars). NCIG may further expand the coal transloading facilitys capacity which could require us to fund our pro rata share in a similar manner.Debt Service Costs. With the acquisition of Macarthur in 2011, our debt service costs increased with the addition of $4.1 billion of new debt that included the following.A 2011 Term Loan Facility of $1.0 billion with an interest rate payable of LIBOR plus 2.0%, or 2.26% (as of December 31, 2011) and a maturity date of October 28, 2016; 6.00% Senior Notes of $1.6 billion due November 2018 (the 6.00% Senior Notes), with interest payable on May15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May15, 2012; and6.25% Senior Notes of $1.5 billion due November 2021 (the 6.25% Senior Notes), with interest payable on May15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May15, 2012.While these new debt instruments increased the annual amount of interest to be paid for 2012 and beyond, only the 2011 Term Loan Facility resulted in a $50.0 million increase to our annual amount of principal to be paid ($37.5 million in 2012). See the Contractual Obligations section for our estimated debt service costs as of December 31, 2011 for the next five years and thereafter. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on all of our outstanding debt.On November 15, 2011, we, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers of the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement). Subject to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we will use our reasonable best efforts to register with the SEC exchange notes having substantially identical terms as the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes and to exchange freely tradable exchange notes for such notes within 365 days after the issue date of the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes (effectiveness target date). If we fail to meet the effectiveness target date (a registration default), the annual interest rate on the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes will increase by 0.25% for each 90 day period during which the default continues, up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.0% until the registration default is cured.52Table of ContentsOur total indebtedness as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, consisted of the following: December 31, 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions)Term Loan$468.8 $493.82011 Term Loan Facility1,000.0 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2016 218.17.375% Senior Notes due November 2016650.0 650.06.00% Senior Notes due November 20181,600.0 6.50% Senior Notes due September 2020650.0 650.06.25% Senior Notes due November 20211,500.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026247.3 247.2Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066375.2 373.3Capital lease obligations122.8 69.6Fair value hedge adjustment 2.2Other43.4 45.8Total$6,657.5 $2,750.0We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Facility, the 2011 Term Loan Facility, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 6.00% Senior Notes, the 6.50% Senior Notes, the 6.25% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2011. As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time repurchase debt securities issued by us, in private negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.Margin. As part of our trading and brokerage activities, we may be required to post margin with an exchange or one of our counterparties. The amount and timing of margin posted can vary with the volume of trades and market price volatility. Total margin held at December 31, 2011 was $18.1 million as compared to total margin posted of $192.1 million at December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash inflows for margin were $210.2 million. Net cash outflows for margin were $161.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.Shelf Registration. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires August 7, 2012), at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time: securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units.Historical Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) toCash Flow 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities$1,633.2 $1,087.1 $546.1 50.2 %Net cash used in investing activities(3,807.8) (703.6) (3,104.2) 441.2 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,678.5 (77.1) 1,755.6 (2,277.0)%Operating Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:Higher cash inflows associated with a return of margin posted on trading activities;Increased operating cash flows generated from our Australian Mining operations driven by higher pricing; andA prior year decrease in the utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program. 53Table of ContentsInvesting Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:$2.8 billion for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Macarthur; and Higher current year capital spending, including Prairie State, of $259.2 million related primarily to our expansion projects in Australia, partially offset by prior year spending to establish and ramp up operations at our Bear Run Mine.Financing Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:A net increase in borrowings of long term debt compared to 2010 of $3.9 billion driven by the $4.1 billion of debt proceeds that were used, in part, to fund the Macarthur acquisition; andAcquisition of noncontrolling interests of $2.0 billion.Contractual ObligationsThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due By Year Total Less than1 Year 2 3Years 4 5Years More than5 Years (Dollars in millions)Long term debt obligations (principal and interest)$10,704.2 $458.8 $961.1 $2,722.8 $6,561.5Capital lease obligations (principal and interest)142.0 32.3 67.2 20.8 21.7Operating lease obligations610.9 123.1 196.8 139.9 151.1Unconditional purchase obligations(1)1,313.0 743.6 569.4 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations227.8 50.7 98.8 50.4 27.9Take or pay obligations(2)4,547.6 443.1 824.4 469.0 2,811.1Other long term liabilities(3)3,035.6 174.1 331.0 324.0 2,206.5Total contractual cash obligations$20,581.1 $2,025.7 $3,048.7 $3,726.9 $11,779.8(1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures relate to new mines and expansion and extension projects in Australia and the U.S.(2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal including amounts relating to export facilities. Also includes commitments under electricity, water and coal washing agreements with joint ventures. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans, mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs and exploration obligations.We do not expect any of the $119.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization program. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements.54Table of ContentsAccounts Receivable Securitization. We have an accounts receivable securitization program (securitization program) with a maximum capacity of $275.0 million through our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary (Seller). At December 31, 2011, we had $41.7 million available under the securitization program, net of outstanding letters of credit and amounts drawn. Under the securitization program, we contribute, on a revolving basis, trade receivables of most of our U.S. subsidiaries to the Seller, which then sells the receivables in their entirety to a consortium of unaffiliated asset backed commercial paper conduits (the Conduits). After the sale, we, as servicer of the assets, collect the receivables on behalf of the Conduits for a nominal servicing fee. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to short term borrowings under the Revolver portion of our Credit Facility, effectively managing our overall borrowing costs and providing an additional source for working capital. The current securitization program extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually.The Seller is a separate legal entity whose assets are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Of the receivables sold to the Conduits, a portion of the amount due to the Seller is deferred until the ultimate collection of the underlying receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received total consideration of $4,633.4 million related to accounts receivable sold under the securitization program, including $3,462.7 million of cash up front from the sale of the receivables, an additional $1,004.8 million of cash upon the collection of the underlying receivables, and $165.9 million that had not been collected at December 31, 2011 and was recorded at fair value which approximates carrying value. The reduction in accounts receivable as a result of securitization activity with the Conduits was $150.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010.The securitization activity has been reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating activity because both the cash received from the Conduits upon sale of receivables as well as the cash received from the Conduits upon the ultimate collection of receivables are not subject to significantly different risks given the short term nature of our trade receivables. We recorded expense associated with securitization transactions of $2.0 million, $2.4 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. From time to time, we enter into coal offtake agreements with counterparties where, as a part of the arrangements, we may provide certain financial guarantees on behalf of the counterparties. As of December 31, 2011, we had in place guarantees of $10.0 million on behalf of our counterparties relating to such agreements. To mitigate risk, we place liens on the counterparties production equipment or require performance bonds. In January 2011, we entered into a bilateral cash collateralization agreement in support of certain letters of credit whereby we posted cash collateral in lieu of utilizing our Credit Facility. The capacity under this new agreement is $37.0 million, all of which was posted as collateral at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had a total of $79.7 million posted as collateral under such agreements. The cash collateral is classified within "Cash and cash equivalents" given our ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral.As discussed above in Capital Resources, we also had $65.0 million (Australian dollars) of letters of credit and cash backed bank guarantees outstanding under the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility at December 31, 2011.See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees.55Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are also required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.Postretirement Benefit and Pension Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 for pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $119.7 million, while funding payments were $112.8 million.Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities.We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations.If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts.Health care cost trend rate:For Year Ended December 31, 2011 One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease (Dollars in millions)Effect on total service and interest cost components(1)$8.2 $(6.9)Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1)$121.8 $(104.6)Discount rate:For Year Ended December 31, 2011 One HalfPercentage Point Increase One HalfPercentage Point Decrease (Dollars in millions)Effect on total service and interest cost components(1)$0.7 $(0.7)Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1)$(56.8) $64.8(1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 11.70 years at January 1, 2012.56Table of ContentsAsset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $53.1 million, and payments totaled $16.9 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ.Business Combinations. We account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method requires us to determine the fair value of all acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and all assumed liabilities. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment, and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, and asset lives, among other items.Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three level hierarchy, Levels 1, 2 and 3. Level 3 fair value measurements are those where inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants. Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities.We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels.57Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2011 and 2010, 1% ($8.7 million) and 3% ($18.6 million), respectively, of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements.Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet ImplementedSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter trading as well as brokered trading of coal, is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives and currency hedging portfolios or coal trading activities we employ in support of coal production (as discussed below). We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio.Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price RiskCoal Price Risk Monitored Using VaR. We engage in direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities in over the counter markets. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of risk, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time on trading and brokerage activities.We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2011.The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the expected loss in portfolio value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model calculates a 5 to 15 day holding period dependent upon the products within our portfolio at the time of VaR measurement and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not estimate the maximum loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR.The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk.During the year ended December 31, 2011, the actual low, high, and average VaR was $3.5 million, $30.6 million and $13.4 million, respectively.58Table of ContentsOther Risk Exposures. We also use our coal trading and brokerage platform to support various coal production related activities. These transactions may involve coal to be produced from our mines, coal sourcing arrangements with third party mining companies, joint venture positions with producers or offtake agreements with producers. While the support activities (e.g. forward sale of coal to be produced and or purchased) may ultimately involve market risk sensitive instruments, the sourcing of coal in these arrangements does not involve market risk sensitive instruments and does not encompass the commodity price risks that we monitor through VaR, as discussed above.Future Realization. As of December 31, 2011, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows:Year ofPercentage ofExpirationPortfolio Total201265%201329%20144%20152% 100%We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance.Nonperformance and Credit RiskCoal Trading. The fair value of our coal trading assets and liabilities reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our exposure is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral (margin), requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions.Non Coal Trading. The fair value of our non coal trading derivative assets and liabilities also reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. We conduct our hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks and closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. To reduce our credit exposure for these hedging activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties.Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.05 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $150 million for 2012. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $65 million for 2012. The table at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2011.59Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we manage our debt to achieve a certain ratio of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, we had $5.2 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $1.5 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding and had no interest rate swaps in place. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $15 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $338 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings.Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price RiskLong Term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. Sales under such agreements comprised approximately 91%, 91% and 93% of our worldwide sales (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Substantially all of our coal in the U.S. is contracted in 2012 at planned production levels. We had 40% to 50% of seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in at January 24, 2012. We expect near term macroeconomic movements to dictate quarterly metallurgical coal pricing for the remainder of the 2012 and we are targeting total 2012 metallurgical coal sales of approximately 14 to 15 million tons.Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of cost pass through contracts and derivatives, primarily swaps.Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 160 to 165 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2012. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $38 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $15 million.Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 380,000 to 390,000 tons of explosives during 2012 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $7 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $2 million.60Table of ContentsNotional Amounts and Fair Value.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to, and analysis of, our Adjusted EBITDA results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, asset retirement obligation expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to measure our segments operating performance, and management also believes it is a useful indicator of our ability to meet debt service and capital expenditure requirements. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to its most comparable measure, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as reflected at the end of Item 6. Selected Financial Data and in Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements.The selected financial data for all periods presented reflect the assets, liabilities and results of operations from subsidiaries spun off as Patriot as discontinued operations. We also have classified as discontinued operations those operations recently divested, as well as certain non strategic mining assets held for sale where we have committed to the divestiture of such assets.37Table of ContentsOn October 26, 2011, we acquired Macarthur. Our results of operations include Macarthurs results of operations from the date of acquisition. Macarthurs results are reflected in our Australian Mining Segment. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.We have derived the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 from our audited financial statements.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.OverviewWe are the worlds largest private sector coal company. We own interests in 30 coal mining operations, including a majority interest in 29 coal operations located in the U.S. and Australia and a 50% equity interest in the Middlemount Mine in Australia. We also own an equity interest in a joint venture mining operation in Venezuela. In 2011, we produced 227.5 million tons of coal from continuing operations and sold 250.6 million tons of coal.We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining segment consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal. On October 26, 2011, we acquired Macarthur. Our results of operations include Macarthurs results of operations from the date of acquisition. Macarthurs results are reflected in our Australian Mining Segment. In the U.S., we typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). Our Australia Mining operations are primarily export focused with customers spread across several countries, while a portion of our coal is sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Generally, Australian revenues from individual countries vary year by year based on the demand for electricity, the demand for steel, the strength of the global economy and several other factors including those specific to each country. Historically in Australia Mining operations, we predominately entered into multi year international coal agreements that contained provisions allowing either party to commence a renegotiation of the agreement price annually in the second quarter of each year. Current industry practice, and our practice, is to negotiate pricing for metallurgical coal contracts quarterly and seaborne thermal coal contracts annually. During 2011, approximately 91% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2011, 82% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 15% were to customers outside the U.S. and 3% were to the U.S. industrial sector.Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations.Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, Btu Conversion activities, as well as the optimization of our coal reserve and real estate holdings.To maximize our coal assets and land holdings for long term growth, we are contributing to the development of coal fueled generation, pursuing Btu Conversion projects that would convert coal to natural gas or transportation fuels and advancing clean coal technologies, including CCS.39Table of ContentsAs discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by weather conditions, cost of competing fuels, availability of transportation for coal shipments, labor relations, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the pace of the economic recovery. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand.Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 SummaryGlobal coal consumption rose to an estimated 7.7 billion tonnes in 2011 driven by increased coal use in China, India and other developing Asian nations. Global seaborne demand rose an estimated 6% and exceeded 1 billion tonnes, led by an increase in thermal demand to supply new coal fueled electricity generation brought on line in 2011. Global steel production grew an estimated 7% while China and Indias coal fueled electricity generation rose 14% and 9%, respectively, in 2011.In the U.S., coal markets have been impacted by a weak economy, low electricity generation and depressed near term natural gas prices. U.S. coal electricity generation declined an estimated 6% in 2011 while U.S. coal exports increased 28% to an estimated 108 million tons.Our revenues increased compared to the prior year by $1,234.5 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year by $372.8 million, led by higher average prices in all regions and increased volume in the U.S.Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to the prior year by $183.9 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and increased income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest expense.We ended the year with total available liquidity of $2.3 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources.Tons SoldThe following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 Tons % (Tons in millions)Western U.S. Mining173.6 163.8 9.8 6.0 %Midwestern U.S. Mining30.3 29.7 0.6 2.0 %Australian Mining25.3 25.3 %Trading and Brokerage21.4 25.4 (4.0) (15.7)%Total tons sold250.6 244.2 6.4 2.6 %40Table of ContentsRevenuesThe following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Revenues 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Western U.S. Mining$2,900.4 $2,706.3 $194.1 7.2%Midwestern U.S. Mining1,481.1 1,320.6 160.5 12.2%Australian Mining3,080.7 2,399.9 680.8 28.4%Trading and Brokerage475.1 291.1 184.0 63.2%Corporate and Other37.1 22.0 15.1 68.6%Total revenues$7,974.4 $6,739.9 $1,234.5 18.3%The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues compared to the prior year was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 26.5%, led by increased pricing for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal due to a combination of increased global coal demand and coal supply constraints resulting from weather impacts in early 2011. In 2011, Macarthur operations contributed revenues of $152.9 million on 0.9 million tons sold. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower metallurgical volumes due to a third quarter roof fall and recovery of longwall operations at our North Goonyella Mine and flooding in Queensland that began in late 2010 that lowered production and shipments in the first quarter of 2011. Metallurgical coal sales totaled 9.3 million tons in 2011 as compared to 9.8 million tons in 2010.Western U.S. Mining operations revenues were higher compared to the prior year as volumes and the weighted average sales price were above the prior year. The volume increase of 6.0% was led by increased shipments from our Powder River Basin region due to increased customer demand. Our weighted average sales price rose modestly compared to the prior year (1.2%) as favorable contract pricing in our Southwest region was partially offset by lower pricing in the Powder River Basin region due to a combination of sales mix and the expiration of some higher priced, long term contracts signed before the economic recession in the 2008 and 2009 timeframe.Trading and Brokerage revenues were higher compared to the prior year due to an increase in export volumes, which carry higher prices, and higher overall coal market pricing on our brokerage activity, partially offset by lower domestic volumes. In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements compared to the prior year were due to a higher weighted average sales price of 9.8% driven by favorable contracts signed in recent years. Volumes were also higher (2.0%) due to incremental contributions from our Bear Run Mine (which commenced operations in May 2010) and Wild Boar Mine (which commenced operations in December 2010).Segment Adjusted EBITDAThe following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) toSegment Adjusted EBITDA 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$766.0 $816.7 $(50.7) (6.2)%Midwestern U.S. Mining408.9 322.1 86.8 26.9 %Australian Mining1,194.3 977.4 216.9 22.2 %Trading and Brokerage197.0 77.2 119.8 155.2 %Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,566.2 $2,193.4 $372.8 17.0 %41Table of ContentsAustralian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to a higher weighted average sales price ($742.6 million), partially offset by lower production and higher costs at our North Goonyella Mine due to a roof fall and recovery of longwall operations ($234.7 million), an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($135.8 million), cost escalations for labor, materials and services ($64.0 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced coal shipments ($54.1 million) and lower volumes ($38.1 million), excluding the impact of the North Goonyella roof fall discussed above.Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to higher margins on our brokerage activity due to higher prices as discussed above. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to a higher weighted average sales price ($112.5 million), partially offset by increased labor ($17.7 million) and materials and services costs ($12.4 million) related primarily to compliance measures at our underground mines. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased as compared to the prior year due to higher volume driven labor ($39.1 million) and materials and services costs ($31.3 million), increased equipment repairs and maintenance costs ($33.1 million), a provision related to litigation recorded in the second quarter of 2011 ($24.5 million), and increased commodity costs, net of hedging ($16.1 million). The above decreases to the segments Adjusted EBITDA were partially offset by increased volumes ($88.0 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($41.6 million) as discussed above.Income From Continuing Operations Before Income TaxesThe following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,566.2 $2,193.4 $372.8 17.0%Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1)(437.5) (354.7) (82.8) 23.3%Depreciation, depletion and amortization(482.2) (437.1) (45.1) 10.3%Asset retirement obligation expense(53.1) (47.2) (5.9) 12.5%Interest expense(238.6) (222.0) (16.6) 7.5%Interest income18.9 9.6 9.3 96.9%Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,373.7 $1,142.0 $231.7 20.3%(1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, certain asset sales, resource management costs and revenues, coal royalty expense, costs associated with past mining activities, expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion costs and provisions for certain litigation.Income from continuing operations before income taxes was greater than the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest expense.Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA reflects higher expenses compared to the prior year due primarily to the following:Higher current year expenses in support of our international expansion, acquisition activity and other growth initiatives, including $85.2 million of expenses associated with the acquisition of Macarthur; andLower current year results from equity affiliates ($17.5 million) due to current year losses associated with our joint venture arrangement in Australia ($7.3 million) and earnings recognized in the prior year associated with transaction services related to our Mongolian joint venture ($10.0 million); partially offset byIncreased gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($46.9 million) driven by current year non cash exchanges of coal reserves in Kentucky and coal reserves and surface lands in Illinois for coal reserves in West Virginia ($37.7 million) and current year gains of $31.7 million associated with sales of non strategic coal reserves in Kentucky and Illinois, partially offset by prior year gains associated with non cash exchanges of coal reserves in Kentucky and coal reserves and surface lands in Illinois for coal reserves in West Virginia ($23.7 million); and 42Table of ContentsA current year gain associated with the receipt of a $14.6 million project development fee related to our involvement in Prairie State. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased compared to the prior year primarily driven by additional expense associated with the assets acquired in the Macarthur acquisition.Interest expense increased $16.6 million over the prior year due primarily to current year acquisition related interest expense of $45.3 million, which includes $29.1 million of expense related to ongoing financing and $16.2 million of expense for bridge financing, partially offset by costs in the prior year of $9.3 million associated with the refinancing of our five year Credit Facility and $8.4 million of charges associated with the extinguishment of $650.0 million of senior notes.Net Income Attributable to Common StockholdersThe following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,373.7 $1,142.0 $231.7 20.3 %Income tax provision363.2 315.4 47.8 15.2 %Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes1,010.5 826.6 183.9 22.2 %Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes(64.2) (24.4) (39.8) 163.1 %Net income946.3 802.2 144.1 18.0 %Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests(11.4) 28.2 (39.6) (140.4)%Net income attributable to common stockholders$957.7 $774.0 $183.7 23.7 %Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to the prior year due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above.The provision for income taxes increased compared to the prior year due to higher current year earnings ($81.1 million), a change in valuation allowances ($44.1 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits released in the prior year and higher current year state income taxes ($17.1 million). The increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower current year foreign earnings repatriation expense ($76.9 million) and a current year benefit of $0.9 million associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as compared to remeasurement expense of $47.9 million in the prior year as the Australian exchange rate decreased against the U.S. dollar in the current year as compared to an increase in the prior year, as set forth in the table below.

This decrease is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.43Table of ContentsThe fair value of our coal trading positions, before the application of margin, designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sales changed from a liability of $174.2 million at December 31, 2010 to a liability of $22.4 million at December 31, 2011 due to favorable market price movements on our positions held and realization of completed transactions.Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 SummaryIn the U.S., demand for coal rose approximately 75 million tons in 2010, led by a 5.5% increase in coal fueled generation and an 18 million ton rise in exports. The international coal markets strengthened in 2010 due to strong Asian demand growth and weather related generation recovery in the Atlantic markets, coupled with supply challenges across the major coal exporting nations of the Southern Hemisphere. Our analyses of general business conditions indicate the following:Seaborne coal demand increased an estimated 13% in 2010, led by a 32% recovery in global metallurgical coal demand;Pacific thermal coal demand for electricity generation rose 15% in 2010, while the Atlantic market declined 10%;Benchmark pricing of high quality, hard coking coal in the seaborne market has ranged between $200 to $225 per tonne from April to December 2010;The benchmark prompt seaborne thermal coal price in Newcastle, Australia rose 34% in 2010;U.S. coal generation accounted for nearly two thirds of the growth in total power output in 2010 due to new coal fueled generation, favorable weather, and a partial reversal of 2009s coal to gas switching; andIndexed U.S. coal prices rose in 2010 in all regions, with increases ranging from 30 to 50%.Our 2010 revenues increased compared to 2009 by $892.9 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over 2009 by $586.1 million, led by higher Australian pricing and sales volumes in 2010 despite unfavorable weather related volume impacts that occurred late in 2010.Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to 2009 by $383.4 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by increased income taxes, decreased Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and interest expense.We ended 2010 with total available liquidity of $2.7 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources.Tons SoldThe following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining163.8 160.1 3.7 2.3 %Midwestern U.S. Mining29.7 31.8 (2.1) (6.6)%Australian Mining25.3 20.0 5.3 26.5 %Trading and Brokerage25.4 29.4 (4.0) (13.6)%Total tons sold244.2 241.3 2.9 1.2 %44Table of ContentsRevenuesThe following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Revenues 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$2,706.3 $2,612.6 $93.7 3.6 %Midwestern U.S. Mining1,320.6 1,303.8 16.8 1.3 %Australian Mining2,399.9 1,512.6 887.3 58.7 %Trading and Brokerage291.1 391.0 (99.9) (25.5)%Corporate and Other22.0 27.0 (5.0) (18.5)%Total revenues$6,739.9 $5,847.0 $892.9 15.3 %The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 25.4%, led by increased pricing on seaborne metallurgical and thermal coals and a higher mix of metallurgical coal shipments. Volumes also increased in 2010 (26.5%) driven by increased demand for metallurgical coal (metallurgical coal shipments of 9.8 million tons were 2.9 million tons, or 42.0%, greater than 2009). These increases were muted to an extent by the flooding in Queensland in late 2010 that negatively impacted our production and also restricted throughput due to damage to the port and rail systems. The metallurgical coal demand increase reflects the strengthening of the coal markets as discussed above, coupled with 2009 customer destocking of inventory and lower capacity utilization at steel customers.Western U.S. Mining operations revenues increased compared to 2009 due to increased sales volume (2.3%) driven by our Powder River Basin and Southwest regions due to increased customer demand and a higher weighted average sales price of 1.3%.In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements due to an increase in our weighted average sales price of 8.4% from contractual price increases were largely offset by decreased shipments (6.6%) on lower customer demand.Trading and Brokerage revenues were down primarily due to lower international brokerage revenues, unfavorable market movements on freight positions that support our export volumes and weather related shipment deferrals.Segment Adjusted EBITDAThe following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$816.7 $721.5 $95.2 13.2 %Midwestern U.S. Mining322.1 281.9 40.2 14.3 %Australian Mining977.4 410.5 566.9 138.1 %Trading and Brokerage77.2 193.4 (116.2) (60.1)%Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,193.4 $1,607.3 $586.1 36.5 %Our Australian Mining segment benefited from a higher weighted average sales price ($408.3 million) and increased volumes ($134.0 million) as discussed above, and productivity improvements at our North Goonyella and Wambo underground mines along with fewer longwall move days in 2010 ($116.0 million). Partially offsetting the above improvements were net higher adverse weather impacts driven by the flooding in late 2010, unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($34.5 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced metallurgical coal shipments ($31.7 million) and increased demurrage costs ($10.7 million).45Table of ContentsWestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to 2009 due to the higher volumes ($49.8 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($42.1 million) discussed above, lower repairs and maintenance costs due to timing of repairs and improved equipment efficiency ($35.0 million) and fewer longwall move days at our Twentymile Mine in 2010 ($10.0 million), partially offset by 2009 customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million) and increased commodity costs in the 2010 ($20.8 million).In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, a higher weighted average sales price ($98.5 million), as discussed above, was partially offset by lower volumes ($42.3 million) due to decreased demand and increased costs on lower productivity due to compliance measures and geological conditions at certain underground mines.Our Trading and Brokerage segment was down primarily due to the lower revenues as discussed above.Income From Continuing Operations Before Income TaxesThe following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,193.4 $1,607.3 $586.1 36.5%Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1)(354.7) (344.5) (10.2) 3.0%Depreciation, depletion and amortization(437.1) (400.5) (36.6) 9.1%Asset retirement obligation expense(47.2) (39.9) (7.3) 18.3%Interest expense(222.0) (201.1) (20.9) 10.4%Interest income9.6 8.1 1.5 18.5%Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,142.0 $629.4 $512.6 81.4%(1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, certain asset sales, resource management costs and revenue, coal royalty expense, costs associated with past mining obligations, expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion costs and provision for certain litigation.Income from continuing operations before income taxes was higher compared to 2009 primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense as discussed below:Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA: higher expense was primarily driven by an increase in selling and administrative expenses due to costs to support our business development and international expansion (e.g. headcount, travel, professional services, legal). We also incurred increased post mining costs driven by higher retiree healthcare amortization of actuarial losses and interest cost. These items were partially offset by improved results from equity affiliates primarily due to 2009 losses of $54.6 million related to our equity investment in Carbones del Guasare, which included a $34.7 million impairment loss and $19.9 million of operating losses. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.Depreciation, depletion and amortization: higher compared to 2009 due to increased production at our Australian mines with higher per ton depletion rates reflecting higher demand and additional depreciation expense associated with our new Bear Run Mine (commissioned in the second quarter of 2010).Interest expense: higher primarily due to refinancing charges ($9.3 million) associated with our new five year Credit Facility and charges ($8.4 million) associated with the extinguishment and refinancing of $650.0 million of senior notes.46Table of ContentsNet Income Attributable to Common StockholdersThe following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,142.0 $629.4 $512.6 81.4 %Income tax provision315.4 186.2 129.2 69.4 %Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes826.6 443.2 383.4 86.5 %(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes(24.4) 19.8 (44.2) (223.2)%Net income802.2 463.0 339.2 73.3 %Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests28.2 14.8 13.4 90.5 %Net income attributable to common stockholders$774.0 $448.2 $325.8 72.7 %Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to 2009 due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above.Income tax provision was impacted by the following:Increased expense due to higher earnings ($179.4 million) and income tax resulting from foreign earnings repatriation ($84.5 million), partially offset byA change in the valuation allowance ($46.0 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits, lower expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the larger increase in the Australian exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in 2009 compared to 2010 ($26.5 million) as set forth in the table below, the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in 2010 ($41.1 million), and lower expense in 2010 due to the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination of the 2005 federal income tax year ($15.2 million).

The increase is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Outlook Our near term outlook is intended to address the next 12 24 months, with any subsequent periods addressed in our long term outlook. 47Table of ContentsNear Term Outlook Global coal consumption rose in 2011 to an estimated 7.7 billion tonnes, driven by increased coal use in China, India and other developing Asian nations. Global seaborne demand rose an estimated 6% and exceeded 1 billion tonnes, led by an increase in thermal demand to supply approximately 81 gigawatts of new coal fueled electricity generation brought on line in 2011. In the U.S., coal markets have been marked by a weak economy, low electricity generation and depressed near term natural gas prices. U.S. coal electricity generation declined an estimated 6% in 2011 driven by more mild weather as compared to the prior year as well as some displacement from hydro and natural gas, while U.S. coal exports increased 28% to an estimated 108 million tons.The International Monetary Funds January 2012 World Economic Outlook estimates global economic activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), will grow 3.3% in 2012 and 3.9% in 2013, led by China and India. Chinas GDP is projected to grow 8.2% in 2012 and 8.8% in 2013. India, the worlds second fastest growing economy, is projected to grow 7.0% in 2012 and 7.3% in 2013.According to the World Steel Association, global steel use is expected to increase 5.4% in 2012, with China expected to grow its steel use by 6.0%.Prices for global seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal have come down from record highs during 2011, though recent settlements have still been higher than historical averages. Metallurgical coal prices for high quality hard coking coal and LV PCI settled at $235 and $171 per tonne, respectively, for quarterly contracts commencing January 2012. We have settled first quarter metallurgical coal shipments in line with these recent settlements, with essentially all remaining 2012 metallurgical coal production unpriced. We expect near term macroeconomic movements to dictate quarterly pricing for the remainder of 2012 and we are targeting total 2012 metallurgical coal sales of approximately 14 to 15 million tons.Seaborne thermal coal originating from Newcastle, Australia, has been settled for annual contracts beginning in January 2012 at $116 per tonne. As of January 24, 2012, we had 40% to 50% of 2012 seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in Australia and we are targeting 2012 Australian thermal exports of 12 to 13 million tons.Looking at U.S. markets, the Energy Information Administrations (EIA) February 2012 Short Term Energy Outlook projects 2012 U.S. electric power coal consumption to decline by approximately 2%. U.S. coal production is also expected to decline by 2%, despite slight production expansion in the Western region. U.S. producers will look to increase exports as domestic markets remain weak relative to historic levels and global seaborne thermal markets provide growing sales opportunities.The coal fueled electric power generation decline in 2012 is projected to be primarily driven by depressed near term natural gas prices that are resulting in elevated levels of coal to gas switching, with the largest impact projected to be on Central Appalachian coal supply. If coal to gas switching lasts for a prolonged period during 2012 due to significantly depressed natural gas prices, there may be more substantial unfavorable impacts to all coal supply regions, including the Powder River Basin. We continually adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand.We are targeting our U.S. volumes in 2012 to be on par with prior year levels and are fully committed on pricing. As of January 24, 2012, we had 45% to 55% of planned U.S. production unpriced for 2013. As a result of the current weak U.S. coal market environment, some customers may attempt to delay and or cancel portions of contracted 2012 volumes. Our coal supply agreement contractual terms and conditions provide support for us to seek full performance from all customers. In selected cases, we may elect to reach agreement with customers on monetary settlements and or contract extensions for 2013 and beyond in exchange for relief on 2012 volumes. Macarthur is expected to contribute less than $100 million of EBITDA in 2012 given the significant cost increases necessary to correct overburden deficiencies at the Coppabella Mine and to complete major repairs at both the Coppabella and Moorvale mines that had been deferred under previous management. We expect that these expenditures will allow us to enter 2013 with a solid foundation for higher productivity, lower costs, and improved financial performance. In addition, we expect to incur increased depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2012 and beyond driven by a higher average depletion rate associated with the acquisition of Macarthur. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources our debt service cost will also increase as a result of the debt incurred to fund the acquisition of Macarthur.48Table of ContentsWe continue to manage costs and operating performance in an effort to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic issues and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of suboptimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Reductions in the relative cost of other fuels, including natural gas, could impact the use of coal for electricity generation. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook.Dodd Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd Frank Act was enacted, which includes a number of provisions applicable to us in the areas of corporate governance, executive compensation and mine safety and extractive industries disclosure. In addition, the Dodd Frank Act imposes additional regulation of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. Although the Dodd Frank Act generally became effective upon its enactment, many provisions have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and require further action by the federal regulatory authorities. As a result, the ultimate impact of the Dodd Frank Act on us will not be fully known for an extended period of time. We do expect that the Dodd Frank Act will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and Trading and Brokerage activities.European Union Derivatives Regulation. In October 2011, the European Commission adopted proposals to revise its directive on markets in financial instruments (MiFID) and to enact a new regulation on markets in financial instruments (MiFIR). These proposals, which are currently under negotiation by the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, will likely impose additional regulation of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. While the ultimate impact of these proposals will not be known for some time, we do expect that they will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities.Minerals Resource Rent Tax. On May 2, 2010, the Australian government released a report on Australias Future Tax System, which included a recommendation to replace the current resource taxing arrangements imposed on non renewable resources by the Australian federal and state governments with a super profit resource rent tax (the Resource Tax) imposed and administered by the Australian government. As proposed, the Resource Tax would be profit based and would apply to non renewable resources projects, including existing projects. On July 2, 2010, the Australian government announced changes to the Resource Tax and proposed a new minerals resource rent tax (the MRRT). The MRRT would still be profit based, but measures were introduced to lessen the impact of the MRRT. The Australian government and major industry policy makers are actively engaged to work through various structural aspects of the proposed MRRT together with detailed implementation issues. A committee charged with consulting with industry and preparing recommendations as to the final form of the MRRT submitted its report in late December 2010. That committees recommendations largely endorsed the mining industrys understanding as to what was agreed with the federal government prior to the federal election. In March 2011, those recommendations were accepted by the federal government, which included the recommendation that all state royalties (current and future) are creditable against MRRT payments. An implementation group was formed, which included industry participants, to assist with drafting the legislation. Draft legislation and an accompanying explanatory memorandum was released for public consultation on June 7, 2011. The final exposure draft was released for further consultation on September 16, 2011 with legislation formally submitted to the House of Representatives in November 2011. The legislation was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on November 21, 2011 with the committee due to report back to the Senate on March 14, 2012. If the MRRT becomes law, the MRRT will apply to mining profits attributable to the value of resources earned after July 1, 2012 and may affect the level of taxation incurred by our Australian operations going forward.Carbon Pricing Framework. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Australian government passed a legislative package that included a carbon pricing framework that commences July 1, 2012. The carbon price will initially be $23.00 Australian dollars per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, escalated by 2.5% per year for inflation over a three year period. After June 30, 2015, the carbon price mechanism will transition to an emissions trading scheme. We believe that all of our Australian operations will be impacted by the fugitive emissions portion of the framework (defined as the methane and carbon dioxide which escapes into the atmosphere when coal is mined and gas is produced), which we estimate will initially average $2.00 to $3.25 Australian dollars per tonne of coal produced annually. Actual results will be dependent upon the volume of tons produced at each of our mining locations as the impact per tonne at our surface mines will generally be less than the impact per tonne at our underground mines. In addition, our Australian mines will be impacted by the phased reduction of the governments diesel fuel rebate to capture emissions from fuel combustion. Our North Goonyella, Wambo and Metropolitan mines will be eligible to apply for a portion of the governments approximately $1.3 billion Australian dollars of transition benefits that would provide assistance based on historical emissions intensity data to the most emissions intensive coal mines over a six year period.49Table of ContentsCross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). On July 6, 2011, the U.S. EPA finalized CSAPR, which requires 28 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and or fine particle pollution in other states. The CSAPR is one of a number of significant regulations that the EPA has issued or expects to issue that will impose more stringent requirements relating to air, water and waste controls on electric generating units. Under the CSAPR, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions would commence in 2012 with further reductions effective in 2014. In October 2011, the EPA proposed amendments to the CSAPR to increase emission budgets in ten states, including Texas, and ease limits on market based compliance options. While CSAPR had an initial compliance deadline of January 1, 2012, the rule was challenged and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed CSAPR and advised that the EPA is expected to continue administering CAIR until the pending challenges are resolved. Expedited briefing on the merits of the challenge is underway. We continue to evaluate the possible scenarios associated with the CSAPR and the impacts it may have on our business and our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2011, coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for the past decade.The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates in its World Energy Outlook 2011, current policies scenario, that world primary energy demand will grow 51% between 2009 and 2035. Demand for coal is projected to rise 65%, and the growth in global electricity generation from coal is expected to be greater than the growth in oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, biomass, geothermal and solar combined. China and India account for more than 75% of the 2009 2035 coal based primary energy demand growth. Under the current policies scenario, the IEA expects coal to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide. Coals share of the power generation mix was 47% in 2009. By 2035, the IEA estimates coals fuel share of power generation to be 49% as it continues to have the largest share of worldwide electric power production. According to industry reports, approximately 370 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity generating plants are currently planned or under construction around the world with expected completion between 2012 and 2016. Based on those estimates, when complete, those plants would require an estimated 1.2 billion tonnes of coal annually. In the U.S., while coal based plant retirements are expected, the EIA is projecting coal demand to remain relatively constant through 2015. The IEA projects that global natural gas fueled electricity generation will have a compound annual growth rate of 2.7%, from 4.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2009 to 8.7 trillion kilowatt hours in 2035. The total amount of electricity generated from natural gas is expected to be approximately one half the total for coal, even in 2035. Renewables are projected to comprise 23% of the 2035 fuel mix versus 19% in 2009. Nuclear power is expected to grow 50%, however its share of total generation is expected to fall from 13.5% to 10% between 2009 and 2035. The recent events in Japan and Germany may impact these projections. Generation from liquid fuels is projected to decline an average of 2.1% annually to 1.5% of the 2035 generation mix.We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as coal to gas (CTG) and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. Several CTG and CTL facilities are currently under development in China and India. We continue to support clean coal technology development toward the ultimate goal of near zero emissions, and we are advancing more than a dozen projects and partnerships in the U.S., China and Australia. Clean coal technology development in the U.S. has funding earmarked under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In addition, the Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage was formed to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy surrounding the commercial development of commercial carbon capture and storage projects. Our work in new or recently commercialized technologies could expose us to unanticipated risks, evolving legislation and uncertainty regarding the extent of future government support and funding.Our long term plans also include advancing projects to expand our presence in the Asia Pacific region, some of which include sourcing coal to be sold through our Trading and Brokerage segment and partnerships to utilize our mining experience for joint mine development. In July 2011, we entered into a framework agreement to pursue development of a 50 million ton per year surface mine in Xinjiang, China. Also in July 2011, we were selected to be part of a consortium to develop the Tavan Tolgoi coking coal reserve in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The Government of Mongolia continues to evaluate the structure and components of the mine development, and we are negotiating with other parties and the Government of Mongolia regarding long term agreements related to the project. Any agreements would then be submitted for consideration and approval by government agencies and the Parliament of Mongolia.50Table of ContentsEnactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in, the state of commercial development and deployment of CCS technologies and the alternative markets for coal. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital ResourcesOur primary sources of cash are the sales of our coal production to customers and from the cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities. To a lesser extent, we also generate cash from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface land and from financing transactions. Along with cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity includes the available balances from our Revolver under our Credit Facility, an accounts receivable securitization program and a bank overdraft facility in Australia. Our available liquidity as of December 31, 2011 was $2.3 billion, which included cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 billion, $1.5 billion available for borrowing under the Revolver, net of outstanding letters of credit of $21.0 million, and available capacity under our accounts receivable securitization program of $41.7 million, net of outstanding letters of credit and amounts drawn. Our liquidity is also impacted by activity under certain bilateral cash collateralization arrangements. We assumed Macarthurs three year $330.0 million Australian dollar Corporate Funding Facility (Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility) as part of the acquisition that has a maturity date of November 30, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings under the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility. The Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility has a $130.0 million Australian dollar sub limit for bank guarantees, leaving an available capacity of $200.0 million Australian dollars at December 31, 2011. Letters of credit and cash backed bank guarantees totaling $65.0 million Australian dollars were outstanding as of December 31, 2011. We plan to terminate the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility in 2012.As of December 31, 2011, approximately $284 million of our cash was held in the U.S. with approximately $515 million held by foreign subsidiaries, primarily those in our Australia Mining segment. Nearly all of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars and is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. The cash held in Australia is currently expected to be used to fund, in part, our organic growth projects, sustaining capital expenditures and existing operations. We currently expect that our available liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements during the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. In addition to the above, alternative sources of liquidity include our ability to offer and sell securities under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC. Capital RequirementsOur primary uses of cash include the cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, coal reserve lease and royalty payments, debt service costs (interest and principal), lease obligations, take or pay obligations and costs related to past mining obligations. When in compliance with the financial covenants and customary default provisions of our Credit Facility and 2011 Term Loan Facility, we are not restricted in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase capital stock provided that we may only redeem and repurchase capital stock with the proceeds received from the concurrent issue of capital stock or indebtedness permitted under the Credit Facility and 2011 Term Loan Facility.Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2012 are anticipated to be $1.2 to $1.4 billion. Approximately $800 to $950 million is earmarked for growth projects that encompass future mine development, as well as the expansion and extension of existing mines, with much of the remaining allocated to sustaining capital expenditures for existing operations. The increase in planned capital expenditures for 2012 compared to 2011 is due to the continued advancement of multiple organic growth projects at our Millennium, Metropolitan and Burton mines. Approximately 75% of the growth and expansion capital is targeted for various Australian projects for metallurgical and thermal coal, with the remainder in the U.S. Our 2012 capital expenditures will include spending to begin converting two of our Australian mines from contract mining to owner operations. 51Table of ContentsFederal Coal Lease Expenditures. We currently anticipate that our federal coal lease expenditures will be $42.1 million in 2012 and for each of the next three years. These expenditures may increase in 2012 and beyond depending upon our participation in and the successful bidding on future federal coal leases.Dividends. We have declared and paid quarterly dividends since our initial public offering in 2001. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.085 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2012. The declaration and payment of dividends and the amount of dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by our debt instruments and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.Pension Contributions. During 2011, we made contributions of $46.7 million. In 2012, our anticipated pension contributions needed to be at or above the Pension Protection Act thresholds is approximately $5 million.Share Repurchase Program. At December 31, 2011, our available capacity for share repurchases was $700.4 million, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside of the share repurchase program. While no such share repurchases were made in 2011, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options.NCIG. Financing for phase one of stage two of construction closed in 2010 with us providing our pro rata share of funding of $59.7 million Australian dollars ($54.8 million U.S. dollars). NCIG may further expand the coal transloading facilitys capacity which could require us to fund our pro rata share in a similar manner.Debt Service Costs. With the acquisition of Macarthur in 2011, our debt service costs increased with the addition of $4.1 billion of new debt that included the following.A 2011 Term Loan Facility of $1.0 billion with an interest rate payable of LIBOR plus 2.0%, or 2.26% (as of December 31, 2011) and a maturity date of October 28, 2016; 6.00% Senior Notes of $1.6 billion due November 2018 (the 6.00% Senior Notes), with interest payable on May15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May15, 2012; and6.25% Senior Notes of $1.5 billion due November 2021 (the 6.25% Senior Notes), with interest payable on May15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May15, 2012.While these new debt instruments increased the annual amount of interest to be paid for 2012 and beyond, only the 2011 Term Loan Facility resulted in a $50.0 million increase to our annual amount of principal to be paid ($37.5 million in 2012). See the Contractual Obligations section for our estimated debt service costs as of December 31, 2011 for the next five years and thereafter. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on all of our outstanding debt.On November 15, 2011, we, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers of the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement). Subject to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we will use our reasonable best efforts to register with the SEC exchange notes having substantially identical terms as the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes and to exchange freely tradable exchange notes for such notes within 365 days after the issue date of the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes (effectiveness target date). If we fail to meet the effectiveness target date (a registration default), the annual interest rate on the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes will increase by 0.25% for each 90 day period during which the default continues, up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.0% until the registration default is cured.52Table of ContentsOur total indebtedness as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, consisted of the following: December 31, 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions)Term Loan$468.8 $493.82011 Term Loan Facility1,000.0 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2016 218.17.375% Senior Notes due November 2016650.0 650.06.00% Senior Notes due November 20181,600.0 6.50% Senior Notes due September 2020650.0 650.06.25% Senior Notes due November 20211,500.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026247.3 247.2Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066375.2 373.3Capital lease obligations122.8 69.6Fair value hedge adjustment 2.2Other43.4 45.8Total$6,657.5 $2,750.0We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Facility, the 2011 Term Loan Facility, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 6.00% Senior Notes, the 6.50% Senior Notes, the 6.25% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2011. As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time repurchase debt securities issued by us, in private negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.Margin. As part of our trading and brokerage activities, we may be required to post margin with an exchange or one of our counterparties. The amount and timing of margin posted can vary with the volume of trades and market price volatility. Total margin held at December 31, 2011 was $18.1 million as compared to total margin posted of $192.1 million at December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash inflows for margin were $210.2 million. Net cash outflows for margin were $161.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.Shelf Registration. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires August 7, 2012), at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time: securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units.Historical Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) toCash Flow 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities$1,633.2 $1,087.1 $546.1 50.2 %Net cash used in investing activities(3,807.8) (703.6) (3,104.2) 441.2 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,678.5 (77.1) 1,755.6 (2,277.0)%Operating Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:Higher cash inflows associated with a return of margin posted on trading activities;Increased operating cash flows generated from our Australian Mining operations driven by higher pricing; andA prior year decrease in the utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program. 53Table of ContentsInvesting Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:$2.8 billion for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Macarthur; and Higher current year capital spending, including Prairie State, of $259.2 million related primarily to our expansion projects in Australia, partially offset by prior year spending to establish and ramp up operations at our Bear Run Mine.Financing Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:A net increase in borrowings of long term debt compared to 2010 of $3.9 billion driven by the $4.1 billion of debt proceeds that were used, in part, to fund the Macarthur acquisition; andAcquisition of noncontrolling interests of $2.0 billion.Contractual ObligationsThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due By Year Total Less than1 Year 2 3Years 4 5Years More than5 Years (Dollars in millions)Long term debt obligations (principal and interest)$10,704.2 $458.8 $961.1 $2,722.8 $6,561.5Capital lease obligations (principal and interest)142.0 32.3 67.2 20.8 21.7Operating lease obligations610.9 123.1 196.8 139.9 151.1Unconditional purchase obligations(1)1,313.0 743.6 569.4 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations227.8 50.7 98.8 50.4 27.9Take or pay obligations(2)4,547.6 443.1 824.4 469.0 2,811.1Other long term liabilities(3)3,035.6 174.1 331.0 324.0 2,206.5Total contractual cash obligations$20,581.1 $2,025.7 $3,048.7 $3,726.9 $11,779.8(1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures relate to new mines and expansion and extension projects in Australia and the U.S.(2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal including amounts relating to export facilities. Also includes commitments under electricity, water and coal washing agreements with joint ventures. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans, mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs and exploration obligations.We do not expect any of the $119.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization program. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements.54Table of ContentsAccounts Receivable Securitization. We have an accounts receivable securitization program (securitization program) with a maximum capacity of $275.0 million through our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary (Seller). At December 31, 2011, we had $41.7 million available under the securitization program, net of outstanding letters of credit and amounts drawn. Under the securitization program, we contribute, on a revolving basis, trade receivables of most of our U.S. subsidiaries to the Seller, which then sells the receivables in their entirety to a consortium of unaffiliated asset backed commercial paper conduits (the Conduits). After the sale, we, as servicer of the assets, collect the receivables on behalf of the Conduits for a nominal servicing fee. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to short term borrowings under the Revolver portion of our Credit Facility, effectively managing our overall borrowing costs and providing an additional source for working capital. The current securitization program extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually.The Seller is a separate legal entity whose assets are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Of the receivables sold to the Conduits, a portion of the amount due to the Seller is deferred until the ultimate collection of the underlying receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received total consideration of $4,633.4 million related to accounts receivable sold under the securitization program, including $3,462.7 million of cash up front from the sale of the receivables, an additional $1,004.8 million of cash upon the collection of the underlying receivables, and $165.9 million that had not been collected at December 31, 2011 and was recorded at fair value which approximates carrying value. The reduction in accounts receivable as a result of securitization activity with the Conduits was $150.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010.The securitization activity has been reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating activity because both the cash received from the Conduits upon sale of receivables as well as the cash received from the Conduits upon the ultimate collection of receivables are not subject to significantly different risks given the short term nature of our trade receivables. We recorded expense associated with securitization transactions of $2.0 million, $2.4 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. From time to time, we enter into coal offtake agreements with counterparties where, as a part of the arrangements, we may provide certain financial guarantees on behalf of the counterparties. As of December 31, 2011, we had in place guarantees of $10.0 million on behalf of our counterparties relating to such agreements. To mitigate risk, we place liens on the counterparties production equipment or require performance bonds. In January 2011, we entered into a bilateral cash collateralization agreement in support of certain letters of credit whereby we posted cash collateral in lieu of utilizing our Credit Facility. The capacity under this new agreement is $37.0 million, all of which was posted as collateral at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had a total of $79.7 million posted as collateral under such agreements. The cash collateral is classified within "Cash and cash equivalents" given our ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral.As discussed above in Capital Resources, we also had $65.0 million (Australian dollars) of letters of credit and cash backed bank guarantees outstanding under the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility at December 31, 2011.See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees.55Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are also required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.Postretirement Benefit and Pension Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 for pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $119.7 million, while funding payments were $112.8 million.Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities.We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations.If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts.Health care cost trend rate:For Year Ended December 31, 2011 One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease (Dollars in millions)Effect on total service and interest cost components(1)$8.2 $(6.9)Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1)$121.8 $(104.6)Discount rate:For Year Ended December 31, 2011 One HalfPercentage Point Increase One HalfPercentage Point Decrease (Dollars in millions)Effect on total service and interest cost components(1)$0.7 $(0.7)Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1)$(56.8) $64.8(1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 11.70 years at January 1, 2012.56Table of ContentsAsset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $53.1 million, and payments totaled $16.9 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ.Business Combinations. We account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method requires us to determine the fair value of all acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and all assumed liabilities. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment, and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, and asset lives, among other items.Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three level hierarchy, Levels 1, 2 and 3. Level 3 fair value measurements are those where inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants. Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities.We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels.57Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2011 and 2010, 1% ($8.7 million) and 3% ($18.6 million), respectively, of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements.Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet ImplementedSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter trading as well as brokered trading of coal, is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives and currency hedging portfolios or coal trading activities we employ in support of coal production (as discussed below). We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio.Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price RiskCoal Price Risk Monitored Using VaR. We engage in direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities in over the counter markets. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of risk, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time on trading and brokerage activities.We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2011.The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the expected loss in portfolio value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model calculates a 5 to 15 day holding period dependent upon the products within our portfolio at the time of VaR measurement and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not estimate the maximum loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR.The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk.During the year ended December 31, 2011, the actual low, high, and average VaR was $3.5 million, $30.6 million and $13.4 million, respectively.58Table of ContentsOther Risk Exposures. We also use our coal trading and brokerage platform to support various coal production related activities. These transactions may involve coal to be produced from our mines, coal sourcing arrangements with third party mining companies, joint venture positions with producers or offtake agreements with producers. While the support activities (e.g. forward sale of coal to be produced and or purchased) may ultimately involve market risk sensitive instruments, the sourcing of coal in these arrangements does not involve market risk sensitive instruments and does not encompass the commodity price risks that we monitor through VaR, as discussed above.Future Realization. As of December 31, 2011, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows:Year ofPercentage ofExpirationPortfolio Total201265%201329%20144%20152% 100%We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance.Nonperformance and Credit RiskCoal Trading. The fair value of our coal trading assets and liabilities reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our exposure is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral (margin), requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions.Non Coal Trading. The fair value of our non coal trading derivative assets and liabilities also reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. We conduct our hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks and closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. To reduce our credit exposure for these hedging activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties.Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.05 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $150 million for 2012. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $65 million for 2012. The table at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2011.59Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we manage our debt to achieve a certain ratio of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, we had $5.2 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $1.5 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding and had no interest rate swaps in place. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $15 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $338 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings.Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price RiskLong Term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. Sales under such agreements comprised approximately 91%, 91% and 93% of our worldwide sales (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Substantially all of our coal in the U.S. is contracted in 2012 at planned production levels. We had 40% to 50% of seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in at January 24, 2012. We expect near term macroeconomic movements to dictate quarterly metallurgical coal pricing for the remainder of the 2012 and we are targeting total 2012 metallurgical coal sales of approximately 14 to 15 million tons.Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of cost pass through contracts and derivatives, primarily swaps.Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 160 to 165 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2012. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $38 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $15 million.Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 380,000 to 390,000 tons of explosives during 2012 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $7 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $2 million.60Table of ContentsNotional Amounts and Fair Value.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.OverviewWe are the worlds largest private sector coal company. We own interests in 30 coal mining operations, including a majority interest in 29 coal operations located in the U.S. and Australia and a 50% equity interest in the Middlemount Mine in Australia. We also own an equity interest in a joint venture mining operation in Venezuela. In 2011, we produced 227.5 million tons of coal from continuing operations and sold 250.6 million tons of coal.We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining segment consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal. On October 26, 2011, we acquired Macarthur. Our results of operations include Macarthurs results of operations from the date of acquisition. Macarthurs results are reflected in our Australian Mining Segment. In the U.S., we typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). Our Australia Mining operations are primarily export focused with customers spread across several countries, while a portion of our coal is sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Generally, Australian revenues from individual countries vary year by year based on the demand for electricity, the demand for steel, the strength of the global economy and several other factors including those specific to each country. Historically in Australia Mining operations, we predominately entered into multi year international coal agreements that contained provisions allowing either party to commence a renegotiation of the agreement price annually in the second quarter of each year. Current industry practice, and our practice, is to negotiate pricing for metallurgical coal contracts quarterly and seaborne thermal coal contracts annually. During 2011, approximately 91% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2011, 82% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 15% were to customers outside the U.S. and 3% were to the U.S. industrial sector.Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations.Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, Btu Conversion activities, as well as the optimization of our coal reserve and real estate holdings.To maximize our coal assets and land holdings for long term growth, we are contributing to the development of coal fueled generation, pursuing Btu Conversion projects that would convert coal to natural gas or transportation fuels and advancing clean coal technologies, including CCS.39Table of ContentsAs discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by weather conditions, cost of competing fuels, availability of transportation for coal shipments, labor relations, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the pace of the economic recovery. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand.Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 SummaryGlobal coal consumption rose to an estimated 7.7 billion tonnes in 2011 driven by increased coal use in China, India and other developing Asian nations. Global seaborne demand rose an estimated 6% and exceeded 1 billion tonnes, led by an increase in thermal demand to supply new coal fueled electricity generation brought on line in 2011. Global steel production grew an estimated 7% while China and Indias coal fueled electricity generation rose 14% and 9%, respectively, in 2011.In the U.S., coal markets have been impacted by a weak economy, low electricity generation and depressed near term natural gas prices. U.S. coal electricity generation declined an estimated 6% in 2011 while U.S. coal exports increased 28% to an estimated 108 million tons.Our revenues increased compared to the prior year by $1,234.5 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year by $372.8 million, led by higher average prices in all regions and increased volume in the U.S.Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to the prior year by $183.9 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and increased income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest expense.We ended the year with total available liquidity of $2.3 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources.Tons SoldThe following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 Tons % (Tons in millions)Western U.S. Mining173.6 163.8 9.8 6.0 %Midwestern U.S. Mining30.3 29.7 0.6 2.0 %Australian Mining25.3 25.3 %Trading and Brokerage21.4 25.4 (4.0) (15.7)%Total tons sold250.6 244.2 6.4 2.6 %40Table of ContentsRevenuesThe following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Revenues 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Western U.S. Mining$2,900.4 $2,706.3 $194.1 7.2%Midwestern U.S. Mining1,481.1 1,320.6 160.5 12.2%Australian Mining3,080.7 2,399.9 680.8 28.4%Trading and Brokerage475.1 291.1 184.0 63.2%Corporate and Other37.1 22.0 15.1 68.6%Total revenues$7,974.4 $6,739.9 $1,234.5 18.3%The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues compared to the prior year was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 26.5%, led by increased pricing for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal due to a combination of increased global coal demand and coal supply constraints resulting from weather impacts in early 2011. In 2011, Macarthur operations contributed revenues of $152.9 million on 0.9 million tons sold. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower metallurgical volumes due to a third quarter roof fall and recovery of longwall operations at our North Goonyella Mine and flooding in Queensland that began in late 2010 that lowered production and shipments in the first quarter of 2011. Metallurgical coal sales totaled 9.3 million tons in 2011 as compared to 9.8 million tons in 2010.Western U.S. Mining operations revenues were higher compared to the prior year as volumes and the weighted average sales price were above the prior year. The volume increase of 6.0% was led by increased shipments from our Powder River Basin region due to increased customer demand. Our weighted average sales price rose modestly compared to the prior year (1.2%) as favorable contract pricing in our Southwest region was partially offset by lower pricing in the Powder River Basin region due to a combination of sales mix and the expiration of some higher priced, long term contracts signed before the economic recession in the 2008 and 2009 timeframe.Trading and Brokerage revenues were higher compared to the prior year due to an increase in export volumes, which carry higher prices, and higher overall coal market pricing on our brokerage activity, partially offset by lower domestic volumes. In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements compared to the prior year were due to a higher weighted average sales price of 9.8% driven by favorable contracts signed in recent years. Volumes were also higher (2.0%) due to incremental contributions from our Bear Run Mine (which commenced operations in May 2010) and Wild Boar Mine (which commenced operations in December 2010).Segment Adjusted EBITDAThe following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) toSegment Adjusted EBITDA 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$766.0 $816.7 $(50.7) (6.2)%Midwestern U.S. Mining408.9 322.1 86.8 26.9 %Australian Mining1,194.3 977.4 216.9 22.2 %Trading and Brokerage197.0 77.2 119.8 155.2 %Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,566.2 $2,193.4 $372.8 17.0 %41Table of ContentsAustralian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to a higher weighted average sales price ($742.6 million), partially offset by lower production and higher costs at our North Goonyella Mine due to a roof fall and recovery of longwall operations ($234.7 million), an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($135.8 million), cost escalations for labor, materials and services ($64.0 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced coal shipments ($54.1 million) and lower volumes ($38.1 million), excluding the impact of the North Goonyella roof fall discussed above.Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to higher margins on our brokerage activity due to higher prices as discussed above. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to a higher weighted average sales price ($112.5 million), partially offset by increased labor ($17.7 million) and materials and services costs ($12.4 million) related primarily to compliance measures at our underground mines. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased as compared to the prior year due to higher volume driven labor ($39.1 million) and materials and services costs ($31.3 million), increased equipment repairs and maintenance costs ($33.1 million), a provision related to litigation recorded in the second quarter of 2011 ($24.5 million), and increased commodity costs, net of hedging ($16.1 million). The above decreases to the segments Adjusted EBITDA were partially offset by increased volumes ($88.0 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($41.6 million) as discussed above.Income From Continuing Operations Before Income TaxesThe following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,566.2 $2,193.4 $372.8 17.0%Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1)(437.5) (354.7) (82.8) 23.3%Depreciation, depletion and amortization(482.2) (437.1) (45.1) 10.3%Asset retirement obligation expense(53.1) (47.2) (5.9) 12.5%Interest expense(238.6) (222.0) (16.6) 7.5%Interest income18.9 9.6 9.3 96.9%Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,373.7 $1,142.0 $231.7 20.3%(1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, certain asset sales, resource management costs and revenues, coal royalty expense, costs associated with past mining activities, expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion costs and provisions for certain litigation.Income from continuing operations before income taxes was greater than the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest expense.Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA reflects higher expenses compared to the prior year due primarily to the following:Higher current year expenses in support of our international expansion, acquisition activity and other growth initiatives, including $85.2 million of expenses associated with the acquisition of Macarthur; andLower current year results from equity affiliates ($17.5 million) due to current year losses associated with our joint venture arrangement in Australia ($7.3 million) and earnings recognized in the prior year associated with transaction services related to our Mongolian joint venture ($10.0 million); partially offset byIncreased gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($46.9 million) driven by current year non cash exchanges of coal reserves in Kentucky and coal reserves and surface lands in Illinois for coal reserves in West Virginia ($37.7 million) and current year gains of $31.7 million associated with sales of non strategic coal reserves in Kentucky and Illinois, partially offset by prior year gains associated with non cash exchanges of coal reserves in Kentucky and coal reserves and surface lands in Illinois for coal reserves in West Virginia ($23.7 million); and 42Table of ContentsA current year gain associated with the receipt of a $14.6 million project development fee related to our involvement in Prairie State. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased compared to the prior year primarily driven by additional expense associated with the assets acquired in the Macarthur acquisition.Interest expense increased $16.6 million over the prior year due primarily to current year acquisition related interest expense of $45.3 million, which includes $29.1 million of expense related to ongoing financing and $16.2 million of expense for bridge financing, partially offset by costs in the prior year of $9.3 million associated with the refinancing of our five year Credit Facility and $8.4 million of charges associated with the extinguishment of $650.0 million of senior notes.Net Income Attributable to Common StockholdersThe following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,373.7 $1,142.0 $231.7 20.3 %Income tax provision363.2 315.4 47.8 15.2 %Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes1,010.5 826.6 183.9 22.2 %Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes(64.2) (24.4) (39.8) 163.1 %Net income946.3 802.2 144.1 18.0 %Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests(11.4) 28.2 (39.6) (140.4)%Net income attributable to common stockholders$957.7 $774.0 $183.7 23.7 %Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to the prior year due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above.The provision for income taxes increased compared to the prior year due to higher current year earnings ($81.1 million), a change in valuation allowances ($44.1 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits released in the prior year and higher current year state income taxes ($17.1 million). The increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower current year foreign earnings repatriation expense ($76.9 million) and a current year benefit of $0.9 million associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as compared to remeasurement expense of $47.9 million in the prior year as the Australian exchange rate decreased against the U.S. dollar in the current year as compared to an increase in the prior year, as set forth in the table below.

This decrease is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.43Table of ContentsThe fair value of our coal trading positions, before the application of margin, designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sales changed from a liability of $174.2 million at December 31, 2010 to a liability of $22.4 million at December 31, 2011 due to favorable market price movements on our positions held and realization of completed transactions.Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 SummaryIn the U.S., demand for coal rose approximately 75 million tons in 2010, led by a 5.5% increase in coal fueled generation and an 18 million ton rise in exports. The international coal markets strengthened in 2010 due to strong Asian demand growth and weather related generation recovery in the Atlantic markets, coupled with supply challenges across the major coal exporting nations of the Southern Hemisphere. Our analyses of general business conditions indicate the following:Seaborne coal demand increased an estimated 13% in 2010, led by a 32% recovery in global metallurgical coal demand;Pacific thermal coal demand for electricity generation rose 15% in 2010, while the Atlantic market declined 10%;Benchmark pricing of high quality, hard coking coal in the seaborne market has ranged between $200 to $225 per tonne from April to December 2010;The benchmark prompt seaborne thermal coal price in Newcastle, Australia rose 34% in 2010;U.S. coal generation accounted for nearly two thirds of the growth in total power output in 2010 due to new coal fueled generation, favorable weather, and a partial reversal of 2009s coal to gas switching; andIndexed U.S. coal prices rose in 2010 in all regions, with increases ranging from 30 to 50%.Our 2010 revenues increased compared to 2009 by $892.9 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over 2009 by $586.1 million, led by higher Australian pricing and sales volumes in 2010 despite unfavorable weather related volume impacts that occurred late in 2010.Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to 2009 by $383.4 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by increased income taxes, decreased Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and interest expense.We ended 2010 with total available liquidity of $2.7 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources.Tons SoldThe following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining163.8 160.1 3.7 2.3 %Midwestern U.S. Mining29.7 31.8 (2.1) (6.6)%Australian Mining25.3 20.0 5.3 26.5 %Trading and Brokerage25.4 29.4 (4.0) (13.6)%Total tons sold244.2 241.3 2.9 1.2 %44Table of ContentsRevenuesThe following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Revenues 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$2,706.3 $2,612.6 $93.7 3.6 %Midwestern U.S. Mining1,320.6 1,303.8 16.8 1.3 %Australian Mining2,399.9 1,512.6 887.3 58.7 %Trading and Brokerage291.1 391.0 (99.9) (25.5)%Corporate and Other22.0 27.0 (5.0) (18.5)%Total revenues$6,739.9 $5,847.0 $892.9 15.3 %The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 25.4%, led by increased pricing on seaborne metallurgical and thermal coals and a higher mix of metallurgical coal shipments. Volumes also increased in 2010 (26.5%) driven by increased demand for metallurgical coal (metallurgical coal shipments of 9.8 million tons were 2.9 million tons, or 42.0%, greater than 2009). These increases were muted to an extent by the flooding in Queensland in late 2010 that negatively impacted our production and also restricted throughput due to damage to the port and rail systems. The metallurgical coal demand increase reflects the strengthening of the coal markets as discussed above, coupled with 2009 customer destocking of inventory and lower capacity utilization at steel customers.Western U.S. Mining operations revenues increased compared to 2009 due to increased sales volume (2.3%) driven by our Powder River Basin and Southwest regions due to increased customer demand and a higher weighted average sales price of 1.3%.In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements due to an increase in our weighted average sales price of 8.4% from contractual price increases were largely offset by decreased shipments (6.6%) on lower customer demand.Trading and Brokerage revenues were down primarily due to lower international brokerage revenues, unfavorable market movements on freight positions that support our export volumes and weather related shipment deferrals.Segment Adjusted EBITDAThe following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$816.7 $721.5 $95.2 13.2 %Midwestern U.S. Mining322.1 281.9 40.2 14.3 %Australian Mining977.4 410.5 566.9 138.1 %Trading and Brokerage77.2 193.4 (116.2) (60.1)%Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,193.4 $1,607.3 $586.1 36.5 %Our Australian Mining segment benefited from a higher weighted average sales price ($408.3 million) and increased volumes ($134.0 million) as discussed above, and productivity improvements at our North Goonyella and Wambo underground mines along with fewer longwall move days in 2010 ($116.0 million). Partially offsetting the above improvements were net higher adverse weather impacts driven by the flooding in late 2010, unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($34.5 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced metallurgical coal shipments ($31.7 million) and increased demurrage costs ($10.7 million).45Table of ContentsWestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to 2009 due to the higher volumes ($49.8 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($42.1 million) discussed above, lower repairs and maintenance costs due to timing of repairs and improved equipment efficiency ($35.0 million) and fewer longwall move days at our Twentymile Mine in 2010 ($10.0 million), partially offset by 2009 customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million) and increased commodity costs in the 2010 ($20.8 million).In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, a higher weighted average sales price ($98.5 million), as discussed above, was partially offset by lower volumes ($42.3 million) due to decreased demand and increased costs on lower productivity due to compliance measures and geological conditions at certain underground mines.Our Trading and Brokerage segment was down primarily due to the lower revenues as discussed above.Income From Continuing Operations Before Income TaxesThe following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,193.4 $1,607.3 $586.1 36.5%Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1)(354.7) (344.5) (10.2) 3.0%Depreciation, depletion and amortization(437.1) (400.5) (36.6) 9.1%Asset retirement obligation expense(47.2) (39.9) (7.3) 18.3%Interest expense(222.0) (201.1) (20.9) 10.4%Interest income9.6 8.1 1.5 18.5%Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,142.0 $629.4 $512.6 81.4%(1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, certain asset sales, resource management costs and revenue, coal royalty expense, costs associated with past mining obligations, expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion costs and provision for certain litigation.Income from continuing operations before income taxes was higher compared to 2009 primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense as discussed below:Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA: higher expense was primarily driven by an increase in selling and administrative expenses due to costs to support our business development and international expansion (e.g. headcount, travel, professional services, legal). We also incurred increased post mining costs driven by higher retiree healthcare amortization of actuarial losses and interest cost. These items were partially offset by improved results from equity affiliates primarily due to 2009 losses of $54.6 million related to our equity investment in Carbones del Guasare, which included a $34.7 million impairment loss and $19.9 million of operating losses. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.Depreciation, depletion and amortization: higher compared to 2009 due to increased production at our Australian mines with higher per ton depletion rates reflecting higher demand and additional depreciation expense associated with our new Bear Run Mine (commissioned in the second quarter of 2010).Interest expense: higher primarily due to refinancing charges ($9.3 million) associated with our new five year Credit Facility and charges ($8.4 million) associated with the extinguishment and refinancing of $650.0 million of senior notes.46Table of ContentsNet Income Attributable to Common StockholdersThe following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,142.0 $629.4 $512.6 81.4 %Income tax provision315.4 186.2 129.2 69.4 %Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes826.6 443.2 383.4 86.5 %(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes(24.4) 19.8 (44.2) (223.2)%Net income802.2 463.0 339.2 73.3 %Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests28.2 14.8 13.4 90.5 %Net income attributable to common stockholders$774.0 $448.2 $325.8 72.7 %Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to 2009 due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above.Income tax provision was impacted by the following:Increased expense due to higher earnings ($179.4 million) and income tax resulting from foreign earnings repatriation ($84.5 million), partially offset byA change in the valuation allowance ($46.0 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits, lower expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the larger increase in the Australian exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in 2009 compared to 2010 ($26.5 million) as set forth in the table below, the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in 2010 ($41.1 million), and lower expense in 2010 due to the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination of the 2005 federal income tax year ($15.2 million).

The increase is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Outlook Our near term outlook is intended to address the next 12 24 months, with any subsequent periods addressed in our long term outlook. 47Table of ContentsNear Term Outlook Global coal consumption rose in 2011 to an estimated 7.7 billion tonnes, driven by increased coal use in China, India and other developing Asian nations. Global seaborne demand rose an estimated 6% and exceeded 1 billion tonnes, led by an increase in thermal demand to supply approximately 81 gigawatts of new coal fueled electricity generation brought on line in 2011. In the U.S., coal markets have been marked by a weak economy, low electricity generation and depressed near term natural gas prices. U.S. coal electricity generation declined an estimated 6% in 2011 driven by more mild weather as compared to the prior year as well as some displacement from hydro and natural gas, while U.S. coal exports increased 28% to an estimated 108 million tons.The International Monetary Funds January 2012 World Economic Outlook estimates global economic activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), will grow 3.3% in 2012 and 3.9% in 2013, led by China and India. Chinas GDP is projected to grow 8.2% in 2012 and 8.8% in 2013. India, the worlds second fastest growing economy, is projected to grow 7.0% in 2012 and 7.3% in 2013.According to the World Steel Association, global steel use is expected to increase 5.4% in 2012, with China expected to grow its steel use by 6.0%.Prices for global seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal have come down from record highs during 2011, though recent settlements have still been higher than historical averages. Metallurgical coal prices for high quality hard coking coal and LV PCI settled at $235 and $171 per tonne, respectively, for quarterly contracts commencing January 2012. We have settled first quarter metallurgical coal shipments in line with these recent settlements, with essentially all remaining 2012 metallurgical coal production unpriced. We expect near term macroeconomic movements to dictate quarterly pricing for the remainder of 2012 and we are targeting total 2012 metallurgical coal sales of approximately 14 to 15 million tons.Seaborne thermal coal originating from Newcastle, Australia, has been settled for annual contracts beginning in January 2012 at $116 per tonne. As of January 24, 2012, we had 40% to 50% of 2012 seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in Australia and we are targeting 2012 Australian thermal exports of 12 to 13 million tons.Looking at U.S. markets, the Energy Information Administrations (EIA) February 2012 Short Term Energy Outlook projects 2012 U.S. electric power coal consumption to decline by approximately 2%. U.S. coal production is also expected to decline by 2%, despite slight production expansion in the Western region. U.S. producers will look to increase exports as domestic markets remain weak relative to historic levels and global seaborne thermal markets provide growing sales opportunities.The coal fueled electric power generation decline in 2012 is projected to be primarily driven by depressed near term natural gas prices that are resulting in elevated levels of coal to gas switching, with the largest impact projected to be on Central Appalachian coal supply. If coal to gas switching lasts for a prolonged period during 2012 due to significantly depressed natural gas prices, there may be more substantial unfavorable impacts to all coal supply regions, including the Powder River Basin. We continually adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand.We are targeting our U.S. volumes in 2012 to be on par with prior year levels and are fully committed on pricing. As of January 24, 2012, we had 45% to 55% of planned U.S. production unpriced for 2013. As a result of the current weak U.S. coal market environment, some customers may attempt to delay and or cancel portions of contracted 2012 volumes. Our coal supply agreement contractual terms and conditions provide support for us to seek full performance from all customers. In selected cases, we may elect to reach agreement with customers on monetary settlements and or contract extensions for 2013 and beyond in exchange for relief on 2012 volumes. Macarthur is expected to contribute less than $100 million of EBITDA in 2012 given the significant cost increases necessary to correct overburden deficiencies at the Coppabella Mine and to complete major repairs at both the Coppabella and Moorvale mines that had been deferred under previous management. We expect that these expenditures will allow us to enter 2013 with a solid foundation for higher productivity, lower costs, and improved financial performance. In addition, we expect to incur increased depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2012 and beyond driven by a higher average depletion rate associated with the acquisition of Macarthur. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources our debt service cost will also increase as a result of the debt incurred to fund the acquisition of Macarthur.48Table of ContentsWe continue to manage costs and operating performance in an effort to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic issues and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of suboptimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Reductions in the relative cost of other fuels, including natural gas, could impact the use of coal for electricity generation. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook.Dodd Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd Frank Act was enacted, which includes a number of provisions applicable to us in the areas of corporate governance, executive compensation and mine safety and extractive industries disclosure. In addition, the Dodd Frank Act imposes additional regulation of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. Although the Dodd Frank Act generally became effective upon its enactment, many provisions have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and require further action by the federal regulatory authorities. As a result, the ultimate impact of the Dodd Frank Act on us will not be fully known for an extended period of time. We do expect that the Dodd Frank Act will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and Trading and Brokerage activities.European Union Derivatives Regulation. In October 2011, the European Commission adopted proposals to revise its directive on markets in financial instruments (MiFID) and to enact a new regulation on markets in financial instruments (MiFIR). These proposals, which are currently under negotiation by the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, will likely impose additional regulation of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. While the ultimate impact of these proposals will not be known for some time, we do expect that they will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities.Minerals Resource Rent Tax. On May 2, 2010, the Australian government released a report on Australias Future Tax System, which included a recommendation to replace the current resource taxing arrangements imposed on non renewable resources by the Australian federal and state governments with a super profit resource rent tax (the Resource Tax) imposed and administered by the Australian government. As proposed, the Resource Tax would be profit based and would apply to non renewable resources projects, including existing projects. On July 2, 2010, the Australian government announced changes to the Resource Tax and proposed a new minerals resource rent tax (the MRRT). The MRRT would still be profit based, but measures were introduced to lessen the impact of the MRRT. The Australian government and major industry policy makers are actively engaged to work through various structural aspects of the proposed MRRT together with detailed implementation issues. A committee charged with consulting with industry and preparing recommendations as to the final form of the MRRT submitted its report in late December 2010. That committees recommendations largely endorsed the mining industrys understanding as to what was agreed with the federal government prior to the federal election. In March 2011, those recommendations were accepted by the federal government, which included the recommendation that all state royalties (current and future) are creditable against MRRT payments. An implementation group was formed, which included industry participants, to assist with drafting the legislation. Draft legislation and an accompanying explanatory memorandum was released for public consultation on June 7, 2011. The final exposure draft was released for further consultation on September 16, 2011 with legislation formally submitted to the House of Representatives in November 2011. The legislation was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on November 21, 2011 with the committee due to report back to the Senate on March 14, 2012. If the MRRT becomes law, the MRRT will apply to mining profits attributable to the value of resources earned after July 1, 2012 and may affect the level of taxation incurred by our Australian operations going forward.Carbon Pricing Framework. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Australian government passed a legislative package that included a carbon pricing framework that commences July 1, 2012. The carbon price will initially be $23.00 Australian dollars per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, escalated by 2.5% per year for inflation over a three year period. After June 30, 2015, the carbon price mechanism will transition to an emissions trading scheme. We believe that all of our Australian operations will be impacted by the fugitive emissions portion of the framework (defined as the methane and carbon dioxide which escapes into the atmosphere when coal is mined and gas is produced), which we estimate will initially average $2.00 to $3.25 Australian dollars per tonne of coal produced annually. Actual results will be dependent upon the volume of tons produced at each of our mining locations as the impact per tonne at our surface mines will generally be less than the impact per tonne at our underground mines. In addition, our Australian mines will be impacted by the phased reduction of the governments diesel fuel rebate to capture emissions from fuel combustion. Our North Goonyella, Wambo and Metropolitan mines will be eligible to apply for a portion of the governments approximately $1.3 billion Australian dollars of transition benefits that would provide assistance based on historical emissions intensity data to the most emissions intensive coal mines over a six year period.49Table of ContentsCross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). On July 6, 2011, the U.S. EPA finalized CSAPR, which requires 28 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and or fine particle pollution in other states. The CSAPR is one of a number of significant regulations that the EPA has issued or expects to issue that will impose more stringent requirements relating to air, water and waste controls on electric generating units. Under the CSAPR, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions would commence in 2012 with further reductions effective in 2014. In October 2011, the EPA proposed amendments to the CSAPR to increase emission budgets in ten states, including Texas, and ease limits on market based compliance options. While CSAPR had an initial compliance deadline of January 1, 2012, the rule was challenged and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed CSAPR and advised that the EPA is expected to continue administering CAIR until the pending challenges are resolved. Expedited briefing on the merits of the challenge is underway. We continue to evaluate the possible scenarios associated with the CSAPR and the impacts it may have on our business and our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2011, coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for the past decade.The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates in its World Energy Outlook 2011, current policies scenario, that world primary energy demand will grow 51% between 2009 and 2035. Demand for coal is projected to rise 65%, and the growth in global electricity generation from coal is expected to be greater than the growth in oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, biomass, geothermal and solar combined. China and India account for more than 75% of the 2009 2035 coal based primary energy demand growth. Under the current policies scenario, the IEA expects coal to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide. Coals share of the power generation mix was 47% in 2009. By 2035, the IEA estimates coals fuel share of power generation to be 49% as it continues to have the largest share of worldwide electric power production. According to industry reports, approximately 370 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity generating plants are currently planned or under construction around the world with expected completion between 2012 and 2016. Based on those estimates, when complete, those plants would require an estimated 1.2 billion tonnes of coal annually. In the U.S., while coal based plant retirements are expected, the EIA is projecting coal demand to remain relatively constant through 2015. The IEA projects that global natural gas fueled electricity generation will have a compound annual growth rate of 2.7%, from 4.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2009 to 8.7 trillion kilowatt hours in 2035. The total amount of electricity generated from natural gas is expected to be approximately one half the total for coal, even in 2035. Renewables are projected to comprise 23% of the 2035 fuel mix versus 19% in 2009. Nuclear power is expected to grow 50%, however its share of total generation is expected to fall from 13.5% to 10% between 2009 and 2035. The recent events in Japan and Germany may impact these projections. Generation from liquid fuels is projected to decline an average of 2.1% annually to 1.5% of the 2035 generation mix.We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as coal to gas (CTG) and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. Several CTG and CTL facilities are currently under development in China and India. We continue to support clean coal technology development toward the ultimate goal of near zero emissions, and we are advancing more than a dozen projects and partnerships in the U.S., China and Australia. Clean coal technology development in the U.S. has funding earmarked under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In addition, the Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage was formed to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy surrounding the commercial development of commercial carbon capture and storage projects. Our work in new or recently commercialized technologies could expose us to unanticipated risks, evolving legislation and uncertainty regarding the extent of future government support and funding.Our long term plans also include advancing projects to expand our presence in the Asia Pacific region, some of which include sourcing coal to be sold through our Trading and Brokerage segment and partnerships to utilize our mining experience for joint mine development. In July 2011, we entered into a framework agreement to pursue development of a 50 million ton per year surface mine in Xinjiang, China. Also in July 2011, we were selected to be part of a consortium to develop the Tavan Tolgoi coking coal reserve in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The Government of Mongolia continues to evaluate the structure and components of the mine development, and we are negotiating with other parties and the Government of Mongolia regarding long term agreements related to the project. Any agreements would then be submitted for consideration and approval by government agencies and the Parliament of Mongolia.50Table of ContentsEnactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in, the state of commercial development and deployment of CCS technologies and the alternative markets for coal. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital ResourcesOur primary sources of cash are the sales of our coal production to customers and from the cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities. To a lesser extent, we also generate cash from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface land and from financing transactions. Along with cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity includes the available balances from our Revolver under our Credit Facility, an accounts receivable securitization program and a bank overdraft facility in Australia. Our available liquidity as of December 31, 2011 was $2.3 billion, which included cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 billion, $1.5 billion available for borrowing under the Revolver, net of outstanding letters of credit of $21.0 million, and available capacity under our accounts receivable securitization program of $41.7 million, net of outstanding letters of credit and amounts drawn. Our liquidity is also impacted by activity under certain bilateral cash collateralization arrangements. We assumed Macarthurs three year $330.0 million Australian dollar Corporate Funding Facility (Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility) as part of the acquisition that has a maturity date of November 30, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings under the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility. The Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility has a $130.0 million Australian dollar sub limit for bank guarantees, leaving an available capacity of $200.0 million Australian dollars at December 31, 2011. Letters of credit and cash backed bank guarantees totaling $65.0 million Australian dollars were outstanding as of December 31, 2011. We plan to terminate the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility in 2012.As of December 31, 2011, approximately $284 million of our cash was held in the U.S. with approximately $515 million held by foreign subsidiaries, primarily those in our Australia Mining segment. Nearly all of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars and is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. The cash held in Australia is currently expected to be used to fund, in part, our organic growth projects, sustaining capital expenditures and existing operations. We currently expect that our available liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements during the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. In addition to the above, alternative sources of liquidity include our ability to offer and sell securities under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC. Capital RequirementsOur primary uses of cash include the cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, coal reserve lease and royalty payments, debt service costs (interest and principal), lease obligations, take or pay obligations and costs related to past mining obligations. When in compliance with the financial covenants and customary default provisions of our Credit Facility and 2011 Term Loan Facility, we are not restricted in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase capital stock provided that we may only redeem and repurchase capital stock with the proceeds received from the concurrent issue of capital stock or indebtedness permitted under the Credit Facility and 2011 Term Loan Facility.Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2012 are anticipated to be $1.2 to $1.4 billion. Approximately $800 to $950 million is earmarked for growth projects that encompass future mine development, as well as the expansion and extension of existing mines, with much of the remaining allocated to sustaining capital expenditures for existing operations. The increase in planned capital expenditures for 2012 compared to 2011 is due to the continued advancement of multiple organic growth projects at our Millennium, Metropolitan and Burton mines. Approximately 75% of the growth and expansion capital is targeted for various Australian projects for metallurgical and thermal coal, with the remainder in the U.S. Our 2012 capital expenditures will include spending to begin converting two of our Australian mines from contract mining to owner operations. 51Table of ContentsFederal Coal Lease Expenditures. We currently anticipate that our federal coal lease expenditures will be $42.1 million in 2012 and for each of the next three years. These expenditures may increase in 2012 and beyond depending upon our participation in and the successful bidding on future federal coal leases.Dividends. We have declared and paid quarterly dividends since our initial public offering in 2001. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.085 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2012. The declaration and payment of dividends and the amount of dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by our debt instruments and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.Pension Contributions. During 2011, we made contributions of $46.7 million. In 2012, our anticipated pension contributions needed to be at or above the Pension Protection Act thresholds is approximately $5 million.Share Repurchase Program. At December 31, 2011, our available capacity for share repurchases was $700.4 million, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside of the share repurchase program. While no such share repurchases were made in 2011, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options.NCIG. Financing for phase one of stage two of construction closed in 2010 with us providing our pro rata share of funding of $59.7 million Australian dollars ($54.8 million U.S. dollars). NCIG may further expand the coal transloading facilitys capacity which could require us to fund our pro rata share in a similar manner.Debt Service Costs. With the acquisition of Macarthur in 2011, our debt service costs increased with the addition of $4.1 billion of new debt that included the following.A 2011 Term Loan Facility of $1.0 billion with an interest rate payable of LIBOR plus 2.0%, or 2.26% (as of December 31, 2011) and a maturity date of October 28, 2016; 6.00% Senior Notes of $1.6 billion due November 2018 (the 6.00% Senior Notes), with interest payable on May15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May15, 2012; and6.25% Senior Notes of $1.5 billion due November 2021 (the 6.25% Senior Notes), with interest payable on May15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May15, 2012.While these new debt instruments increased the annual amount of interest to be paid for 2012 and beyond, only the 2011 Term Loan Facility resulted in a $50.0 million increase to our annual amount of principal to be paid ($37.5 million in 2012). See the Contractual Obligations section for our estimated debt service costs as of December 31, 2011 for the next five years and thereafter. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on all of our outstanding debt.On November 15, 2011, we, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers of the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement). Subject to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we will use our reasonable best efforts to register with the SEC exchange notes having substantially identical terms as the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes and to exchange freely tradable exchange notes for such notes within 365 days after the issue date of the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes (effectiveness target date). If we fail to meet the effectiveness target date (a registration default), the annual interest rate on the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes will increase by 0.25% for each 90 day period during which the default continues, up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.0% until the registration default is cured.52Table of ContentsOur total indebtedness as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, consisted of the following: December 31, 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions)Term Loan$468.8 $493.82011 Term Loan Facility1,000.0 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2016 218.17.375% Senior Notes due November 2016650.0 650.06.00% Senior Notes due November 20181,600.0 6.50% Senior Notes due September 2020650.0 650.06.25% Senior Notes due November 20211,500.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026247.3 247.2Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066375.2 373.3Capital lease obligations122.8 69.6Fair value hedge adjustment 2.2Other43.4 45.8Total$6,657.5 $2,750.0We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Facility, the 2011 Term Loan Facility, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 6.00% Senior Notes, the 6.50% Senior Notes, the 6.25% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2011. As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time repurchase debt securities issued by us, in private negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.Margin. As part of our trading and brokerage activities, we may be required to post margin with an exchange or one of our counterparties. The amount and timing of margin posted can vary with the volume of trades and market price volatility. Total margin held at December 31, 2011 was $18.1 million as compared to total margin posted of $192.1 million at December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash inflows for margin were $210.2 million. Net cash outflows for margin were $161.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.Shelf Registration. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires August 7, 2012), at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time: securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units.Historical Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) toCash Flow 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities$1,633.2 $1,087.1 $546.1 50.2 %Net cash used in investing activities(3,807.8) (703.6) (3,104.2) 441.2 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,678.5 (77.1) 1,755.6 (2,277.0)%Operating Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:Higher cash inflows associated with a return of margin posted on trading activities;Increased operating cash flows generated from our Australian Mining operations driven by higher pricing; andA prior year decrease in the utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program. 53Table of ContentsInvesting Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:$2.8 billion for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Macarthur; and Higher current year capital spending, including Prairie State, of $259.2 million related primarily to our expansion projects in Australia, partially offset by prior year spending to establish and ramp up operations at our Bear Run Mine.Financing Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:A net increase in borrowings of long term debt compared to 2010 of $3.9 billion driven by the $4.1 billion of debt proceeds that were used, in part, to fund the Macarthur acquisition; andAcquisition of noncontrolling interests of $2.0 billion.Contractual ObligationsThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due By Year Total Less than1 Year 2 3Years 4 5Years More than5 Years (Dollars in millions)Long term debt obligations (principal and interest)$10,704.2 $458.8 $961.1 $2,722.8 $6,561.5Capital lease obligations (principal and interest)142.0 32.3 67.2 20.8 21.7Operating lease obligations610.9 123.1 196.8 139.9 151.1Unconditional purchase obligations(1)1,313.0 743.6 569.4 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations227.8 50.7 98.8 50.4 27.9Take or pay obligations(2)4,547.6 443.1 824.4 469.0 2,811.1Other long term liabilities(3)3,035.6 174.1 331.0 324.0 2,206.5Total contractual cash obligations$20,581.1 $2,025.7 $3,048.7 $3,726.9 $11,779.8(1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures relate to new mines and expansion and extension projects in Australia and the U.S.(2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal including amounts relating to export facilities. Also includes commitments under electricity, water and coal washing agreements with joint ventures. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans, mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs and exploration obligations.We do not expect any of the $119.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization program. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements.54Table of ContentsAccounts Receivable Securitization. We have an accounts receivable securitization program (securitization program) with a maximum capacity of $275.0 million through our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary (Seller). At December 31, 2011, we had $41.7 million available under the securitization program, net of outstanding letters of credit and amounts drawn. Under the securitization program, we contribute, on a revolving basis, trade receivables of most of our U.S. subsidiaries to the Seller, which then sells the receivables in their entirety to a consortium of unaffiliated asset backed commercial paper conduits (the Conduits). After the sale, we, as servicer of the assets, collect the receivables on behalf of the Conduits for a nominal servicing fee. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to short term borrowings under the Revolver portion of our Credit Facility, effectively managing our overall borrowing costs and providing an additional source for working capital. The current securitization program extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually.The Seller is a separate legal entity whose assets are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Of the receivables sold to the Conduits, a portion of the amount due to the Seller is deferred until the ultimate collection of the underlying receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received total consideration of $4,633.4 million related to accounts receivable sold under the securitization program, including $3,462.7 million of cash up front from the sale of the receivables, an additional $1,004.8 million of cash upon the collection of the underlying receivables, and $165.9 million that had not been collected at December 31, 2011 and was recorded at fair value which approximates carrying value. The reduction in accounts receivable as a result of securitization activity with the Conduits was $150.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010.The securitization activity has been reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating activity because both the cash received from the Conduits upon sale of receivables as well as the cash received from the Conduits upon the ultimate collection of receivables are not subject to significantly different risks given the short term nature of our trade receivables. We recorded expense associated with securitization transactions of $2.0 million, $2.4 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. From time to time, we enter into coal offtake agreements with counterparties where, as a part of the arrangements, we may provide certain financial guarantees on behalf of the counterparties. As of December 31, 2011, we had in place guarantees of $10.0 million on behalf of our counterparties relating to such agreements. To mitigate risk, we place liens on the counterparties production equipment or require performance bonds. In January 2011, we entered into a bilateral cash collateralization agreement in support of certain letters of credit whereby we posted cash collateral in lieu of utilizing our Credit Facility. The capacity under this new agreement is $37.0 million, all of which was posted as collateral at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had a total of $79.7 million posted as collateral under such agreements. The cash collateral is classified within "Cash and cash equivalents" given our ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral.As discussed above in Capital Resources, we also had $65.0 million (Australian dollars) of letters of credit and cash backed bank guarantees outstanding under the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility at December 31, 2011.See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees.55Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are also required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.Postretirement Benefit and Pension Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 for pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $119.7 million, while funding payments were $112.8 million.Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities.We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations.If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts.Health care cost trend rate:For Year Ended December 31, 2011 One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease (Dollars in millions)Effect on total service and interest cost components(1)$8.2 $(6.9)Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1)$121.8 $(104.6)Discount rate:For Year Ended December 31, 2011 One HalfPercentage Point Increase One HalfPercentage Point Decrease (Dollars in millions)Effect on total service and interest cost components(1)$0.7 $(0.7)Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1)$(56.8) $64.8(1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 11.70 years at January 1, 2012.56Table of ContentsAsset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $53.1 million, and payments totaled $16.9 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ.Business Combinations. We account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method requires us to determine the fair value of all acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and all assumed liabilities. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment, and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, and asset lives, among other items.Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three level hierarchy, Levels 1, 2 and 3. Level 3 fair value measurements are those where inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants. Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities.We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels.57Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2011 and 2010, 1% ($8.7 million) and 3% ($18.6 million), respectively, of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements.Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet ImplementedSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter trading as well as brokered trading of coal, is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives and currency hedging portfolios or coal trading activities we employ in support of coal production (as discussed below). We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio.Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price RiskCoal Price Risk Monitored Using VaR. We engage in direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities in over the counter markets. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of risk, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time on trading and brokerage activities.We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2011.The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the expected loss in portfolio value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model calculates a 5 to 15 day holding period dependent upon the products within our portfolio at the time of VaR measurement and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not estimate the maximum loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR.The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk.During the year ended December 31, 2011, the actual low, high, and average VaR was $3.5 million, $30.6 million and $13.4 million, respectively.58Table of ContentsOther Risk Exposures. We also use our coal trading and brokerage platform to support various coal production related activities. These transactions may involve coal to be produced from our mines, coal sourcing arrangements with third party mining companies, joint venture positions with producers or offtake agreements with producers. While the support activities (e.g. forward sale of coal to be produced and or purchased) may ultimately involve market risk sensitive instruments, the sourcing of coal in these arrangements does not involve market risk sensitive instruments and does not encompass the commodity price risks that we monitor through VaR, as discussed above.Future Realization. As of December 31, 2011, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows:Year ofPercentage ofExpirationPortfolio Total201265%201329%20144%20152% 100%We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance.Nonperformance and Credit RiskCoal Trading. The fair value of our coal trading assets and liabilities reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our exposure is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral (margin), requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions.Non Coal Trading. The fair value of our non coal trading derivative assets and liabilities also reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. We conduct our hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks and closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. To reduce our credit exposure for these hedging activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties.Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.05 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $150 million for 2012. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $65 million for 2012. The table at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2011.59Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we manage our debt to achieve a certain ratio of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, we had $5.2 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $1.5 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding and had no interest rate swaps in place. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $15 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $338 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings.Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price RiskLong Term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. Sales under such agreements comprised approximately 91%, 91% and 93% of our worldwide sales (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Substantially all of our coal in the U.S. is contracted in 2012 at planned production levels. We had 40% to 50% of seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in at January 24, 2012. We expect near term macroeconomic movements to dictate quarterly metallurgical coal pricing for the remainder of the 2012 and we are targeting total 2012 metallurgical coal sales of approximately 14 to 15 million tons.Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of cost pass through contracts and derivatives, primarily swaps.Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 160 to 165 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2012. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $38 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $15 million.Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 380,000 to 390,000 tons of explosives during 2012 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $7 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $2 million.60Table of ContentsNotional Amounts and Fair Value.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.OverviewWe are the worlds largest private sector coal company. We own interests in 30 coal mining operations, including a majority interest in 29 coal operations located in the U.S. and Australia and a 50% equity interest in the Middlemount Mine in Australia. We also own an equity interest in a joint venture mining operation in Venezuela. In 2011, we produced 227.5 million tons of coal from continuing operations and sold 250.6 million tons of coal.We conduct business through four principal segments: Western U.S. Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Australian Mining and Trading and Brokerage. The principal business of the Western and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments is the mining, preparation and sale of thermal coal, sold primarily to electric utilities. Our Western U.S. Mining segment consist of our Powder River Basin, Southwest and Colorado operations. Our Midwestern U.S. Mining segment consist of our Illinois and Indiana operations. The business of our Australian Mining segment is the mining of various qualities of low sulfur, high Btu coal (metallurgical coal) as well as thermal coal. On October 26, 2011, we acquired Macarthur. Our results of operations include Macarthurs results of operations from the date of acquisition. Macarthurs results are reflected in our Australian Mining Segment. In the U.S., we typically sell coal to utility customers under long term contracts (those with terms longer than one year). Our Australia Mining operations are primarily export focused with customers spread across several countries, while a portion of our coal is sold to Australian steel producers and power generators. Generally, Australian revenues from individual countries vary year by year based on the demand for electricity, the demand for steel, the strength of the global economy and several other factors including those specific to each country. Historically in Australia Mining operations, we predominately entered into multi year international coal agreements that contained provisions allowing either party to commence a renegotiation of the agreement price annually in the second quarter of each year. Current industry practice, and our practice, is to negotiate pricing for metallurgical coal contracts quarterly and seaborne thermal coal contracts annually. During 2011, approximately 91% of our worldwide sales (by volume) were under long term contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2011, 82% of our total sales (by volume) were to U.S. electricity generators, 15% were to customers outside the U.S. and 3% were to the U.S. industrial sector.Our Trading and Brokerage segments principal business is the brokering of coal sales of other producers both as principal and agent, and the trading of coal, freight and freight related contracts. We also provide transportation related services in support of our coal trading strategy, as well as hedging activities in support of our mining operations.Our fifth segment, Corporate and Other, includes mining and export/transportation joint ventures, energy related commercial activities, Btu Conversion activities, as well as the optimization of our coal reserve and real estate holdings.To maximize our coal assets and land holdings for long term growth, we are contributing to the development of coal fueled generation, pursuing Btu Conversion projects that would convert coal to natural gas or transportation fuels and advancing clean coal technologies, including CCS.39Table of ContentsAs discussed more fully in Item 1A. Risk Factors, our results of operations in the near term could be negatively impacted by weather conditions, cost of competing fuels, availability of transportation for coal shipments, labor relations, unforeseen geologic conditions or equipment problems at mining locations and by the pace of the economic recovery. On a long term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by our ability to secure or acquire high quality coal reserves, find replacement buyers for coal under contracts with comparable terms to existing contracts or the passage of new or expanded regulations that could limit our ability to mine, increase our mining costs or limit our customers ability to utilize coal as fuel for electricity generation. In the past, we have achieved production levels that are relatively consistent with our projections. We may adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand.Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 SummaryGlobal coal consumption rose to an estimated 7.7 billion tonnes in 2011 driven by increased coal use in China, India and other developing Asian nations. Global seaborne demand rose an estimated 6% and exceeded 1 billion tonnes, led by an increase in thermal demand to supply new coal fueled electricity generation brought on line in 2011. Global steel production grew an estimated 7% while China and Indias coal fueled electricity generation rose 14% and 9%, respectively, in 2011.In the U.S., coal markets have been impacted by a weak economy, low electricity generation and depressed near term natural gas prices. U.S. coal electricity generation declined an estimated 6% in 2011 while U.S. coal exports increased 28% to an estimated 108 million tons.Our revenues increased compared to the prior year by $1,234.5 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over the prior year by $372.8 million, led by higher average prices in all regions and increased volume in the U.S.Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to the prior year by $183.9 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and increased income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest expense.We ended the year with total available liquidity of $2.3 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources.Tons SoldThe following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 Tons % (Tons in millions)Western U.S. Mining173.6 163.8 9.8 6.0 %Midwestern U.S. Mining30.3 29.7 0.6 2.0 %Australian Mining25.3 25.3 %Trading and Brokerage21.4 25.4 (4.0) (15.7)%Total tons sold250.6 244.2 6.4 2.6 %40Table of ContentsRevenuesThe following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Revenues 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Western U.S. Mining$2,900.4 $2,706.3 $194.1 7.2%Midwestern U.S. Mining1,481.1 1,320.6 160.5 12.2%Australian Mining3,080.7 2,399.9 680.8 28.4%Trading and Brokerage475.1 291.1 184.0 63.2%Corporate and Other37.1 22.0 15.1 68.6%Total revenues$7,974.4 $6,739.9 $1,234.5 18.3%The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues compared to the prior year was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 26.5%, led by increased pricing for seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal due to a combination of increased global coal demand and coal supply constraints resulting from weather impacts in early 2011. In 2011, Macarthur operations contributed revenues of $152.9 million on 0.9 million tons sold. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower metallurgical volumes due to a third quarter roof fall and recovery of longwall operations at our North Goonyella Mine and flooding in Queensland that began in late 2010 that lowered production and shipments in the first quarter of 2011. Metallurgical coal sales totaled 9.3 million tons in 2011 as compared to 9.8 million tons in 2010.Western U.S. Mining operations revenues were higher compared to the prior year as volumes and the weighted average sales price were above the prior year. The volume increase of 6.0% was led by increased shipments from our Powder River Basin region due to increased customer demand. Our weighted average sales price rose modestly compared to the prior year (1.2%) as favorable contract pricing in our Southwest region was partially offset by lower pricing in the Powder River Basin region due to a combination of sales mix and the expiration of some higher priced, long term contracts signed before the economic recession in the 2008 and 2009 timeframe.Trading and Brokerage revenues were higher compared to the prior year due to an increase in export volumes, which carry higher prices, and higher overall coal market pricing on our brokerage activity, partially offset by lower domestic volumes. In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements compared to the prior year were due to a higher weighted average sales price of 9.8% driven by favorable contracts signed in recent years. Volumes were also higher (2.0%) due to incremental contributions from our Bear Run Mine (which commenced operations in May 2010) and Wild Boar Mine (which commenced operations in December 2010).Segment Adjusted EBITDAThe following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) toSegment Adjusted EBITDA 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$766.0 $816.7 $(50.7) (6.2)%Midwestern U.S. Mining408.9 322.1 86.8 26.9 %Australian Mining1,194.3 977.4 216.9 22.2 %Trading and Brokerage197.0 77.2 119.8 155.2 %Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,566.2 $2,193.4 $372.8 17.0 %41Table of ContentsAustralian Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to a higher weighted average sales price ($742.6 million), partially offset by lower production and higher costs at our North Goonyella Mine due to a roof fall and recovery of longwall operations ($234.7 million), an unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($135.8 million), cost escalations for labor, materials and services ($64.0 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced coal shipments ($54.1 million) and lower volumes ($38.1 million), excluding the impact of the North Goonyella roof fall discussed above.Trading and Brokerage Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to higher margins on our brokerage activity due to higher prices as discussed above. Midwestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year due to a higher weighted average sales price ($112.5 million), partially offset by increased labor ($17.7 million) and materials and services costs ($12.4 million) related primarily to compliance measures at our underground mines. Western U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA decreased as compared to the prior year due to higher volume driven labor ($39.1 million) and materials and services costs ($31.3 million), increased equipment repairs and maintenance costs ($33.1 million), a provision related to litigation recorded in the second quarter of 2011 ($24.5 million), and increased commodity costs, net of hedging ($16.1 million). The above decreases to the segments Adjusted EBITDA were partially offset by increased volumes ($88.0 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($41.6 million) as discussed above.Income From Continuing Operations Before Income TaxesThe following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,566.2 $2,193.4 $372.8 17.0%Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1)(437.5) (354.7) (82.8) 23.3%Depreciation, depletion and amortization(482.2) (437.1) (45.1) 10.3%Asset retirement obligation expense(53.1) (47.2) (5.9) 12.5%Interest expense(238.6) (222.0) (16.6) 7.5%Interest income18.9 9.6 9.3 96.9%Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,373.7 $1,142.0 $231.7 20.3%(1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, certain asset sales, resource management costs and revenues, coal royalty expense, costs associated with past mining activities, expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion costs and provisions for certain litigation.Income from continuing operations before income taxes was greater than the prior year primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, and interest expense.Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA reflects higher expenses compared to the prior year due primarily to the following:Higher current year expenses in support of our international expansion, acquisition activity and other growth initiatives, including $85.2 million of expenses associated with the acquisition of Macarthur; andLower current year results from equity affiliates ($17.5 million) due to current year losses associated with our joint venture arrangement in Australia ($7.3 million) and earnings recognized in the prior year associated with transaction services related to our Mongolian joint venture ($10.0 million); partially offset byIncreased gains on disposal or exchange of assets ($46.9 million) driven by current year non cash exchanges of coal reserves in Kentucky and coal reserves and surface lands in Illinois for coal reserves in West Virginia ($37.7 million) and current year gains of $31.7 million associated with sales of non strategic coal reserves in Kentucky and Illinois, partially offset by prior year gains associated with non cash exchanges of coal reserves in Kentucky and coal reserves and surface lands in Illinois for coal reserves in West Virginia ($23.7 million); and 42Table of ContentsA current year gain associated with the receipt of a $14.6 million project development fee related to our involvement in Prairie State. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased compared to the prior year primarily driven by additional expense associated with the assets acquired in the Macarthur acquisition.Interest expense increased $16.6 million over the prior year due primarily to current year acquisition related interest expense of $45.3 million, which includes $29.1 million of expense related to ongoing financing and $16.2 million of expense for bridge financing, partially offset by costs in the prior year of $9.3 million associated with the refinancing of our five year Credit Facility and $8.4 million of charges associated with the extinguishment of $650.0 million of senior notes.Net Income Attributable to Common StockholdersThe following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions)Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,373.7 $1,142.0 $231.7 20.3 %Income tax provision363.2 315.4 47.8 15.2 %Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes1,010.5 826.6 183.9 22.2 %Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes(64.2) (24.4) (39.8) 163.1 %Net income946.3 802.2 144.1 18.0 %Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests(11.4) 28.2 (39.6) (140.4)%Net income attributable to common stockholders$957.7 $774.0 $183.7 23.7 %Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to the prior year due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above.The provision for income taxes increased compared to the prior year due to higher current year earnings ($81.1 million), a change in valuation allowances ($44.1 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits released in the prior year and higher current year state income taxes ($17.1 million). The increases to income tax expense were partially offset by lower current year foreign earnings repatriation expense ($76.9 million) and a current year benefit of $0.9 million associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as compared to remeasurement expense of $47.9 million in the prior year as the Australian exchange rate decreased against the U.S. dollar in the current year as compared to an increase in the prior year, as set forth in the table below.

This decrease is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.43Table of ContentsThe fair value of our coal trading positions, before the application of margin, designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sales changed from a liability of $174.2 million at December 31, 2010 to a liability of $22.4 million at December 31, 2011 due to favorable market price movements on our positions held and realization of completed transactions.Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 SummaryIn the U.S., demand for coal rose approximately 75 million tons in 2010, led by a 5.5% increase in coal fueled generation and an 18 million ton rise in exports. The international coal markets strengthened in 2010 due to strong Asian demand growth and weather related generation recovery in the Atlantic markets, coupled with supply challenges across the major coal exporting nations of the Southern Hemisphere. Our analyses of general business conditions indicate the following:Seaborne coal demand increased an estimated 13% in 2010, led by a 32% recovery in global metallurgical coal demand;Pacific thermal coal demand for electricity generation rose 15% in 2010, while the Atlantic market declined 10%;Benchmark pricing of high quality, hard coking coal in the seaborne market has ranged between $200 to $225 per tonne from April to December 2010;The benchmark prompt seaborne thermal coal price in Newcastle, Australia rose 34% in 2010;U.S. coal generation accounted for nearly two thirds of the growth in total power output in 2010 due to new coal fueled generation, favorable weather, and a partial reversal of 2009s coal to gas switching; andIndexed U.S. coal prices rose in 2010 in all regions, with increases ranging from 30 to 50%.Our 2010 revenues increased compared to 2009 by $892.9 million and Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased over 2009 by $586.1 million, led by higher Australian pricing and sales volumes in 2010 despite unfavorable weather related volume impacts that occurred late in 2010.Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, increased compared to 2009 by $383.4 million due to the increase in Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by increased income taxes, decreased Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA, and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and interest expense.We ended 2010 with total available liquidity of $2.7 billion, as discussed further in Liquidity and Capital Resources.Tons SoldThe following table presents tons sold by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Tons % (Tons in millions) Western U.S. Mining163.8 160.1 3.7 2.3 %Midwestern U.S. Mining29.7 31.8 (2.1) (6.6)%Australian Mining25.3 20.0 5.3 26.5 %Trading and Brokerage25.4 29.4 (4.0) (13.6)%Total tons sold244.2 241.3 2.9 1.2 %44Table of ContentsRevenuesThe following table presents revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Revenues 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$2,706.3 $2,612.6 $93.7 3.6 %Midwestern U.S. Mining1,320.6 1,303.8 16.8 1.3 %Australian Mining2,399.9 1,512.6 887.3 58.7 %Trading and Brokerage291.1 391.0 (99.9) (25.5)%Corporate and Other22.0 27.0 (5.0) (18.5)%Total revenues$6,739.9 $5,847.0 $892.9 15.3 %The increase in Australian Mining operations revenues was driven by a higher weighted average sales price of 25.4%, led by increased pricing on seaborne metallurgical and thermal coals and a higher mix of metallurgical coal shipments. Volumes also increased in 2010 (26.5%) driven by increased demand for metallurgical coal (metallurgical coal shipments of 9.8 million tons were 2.9 million tons, or 42.0%, greater than 2009). These increases were muted to an extent by the flooding in Queensland in late 2010 that negatively impacted our production and also restricted throughput due to damage to the port and rail systems. The metallurgical coal demand increase reflects the strengthening of the coal markets as discussed above, coupled with 2009 customer destocking of inventory and lower capacity utilization at steel customers.Western U.S. Mining operations revenues increased compared to 2009 due to increased sales volume (2.3%) driven by our Powder River Basin and Southwest regions due to increased customer demand and a higher weighted average sales price of 1.3%.In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, revenue improvements due to an increase in our weighted average sales price of 8.4% from contractual price increases were largely offset by decreased shipments (6.6%) on lower customer demand.Trading and Brokerage revenues were down primarily due to lower international brokerage revenues, unfavorable market movements on freight positions that support our export volumes and weather related shipment deferrals.Segment Adjusted EBITDAThe following table presents segment Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) to Year Ended December 31, Segment Adjusted EBITDA 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Western U.S. Mining$816.7 $721.5 $95.2 13.2 %Midwestern U.S. Mining322.1 281.9 40.2 14.3 %Australian Mining977.4 410.5 566.9 138.1 %Trading and Brokerage77.2 193.4 (116.2) (60.1)%Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,193.4 $1,607.3 $586.1 36.5 %Our Australian Mining segment benefited from a higher weighted average sales price ($408.3 million) and increased volumes ($134.0 million) as discussed above, and productivity improvements at our North Goonyella and Wambo underground mines along with fewer longwall move days in 2010 ($116.0 million). Partially offsetting the above improvements were net higher adverse weather impacts driven by the flooding in late 2010, unfavorable foreign currency impact on operating costs, net of hedging ($34.5 million), increased royalty expense associated with our higher priced metallurgical coal shipments ($31.7 million) and increased demurrage costs ($10.7 million).45Table of ContentsWestern U.S. Mining operations Adjusted EBITDA increased compared to 2009 due to the higher volumes ($49.8 million) and a higher weighted average sales price ($42.1 million) discussed above, lower repairs and maintenance costs due to timing of repairs and improved equipment efficiency ($35.0 million) and fewer longwall move days at our Twentymile Mine in 2010 ($10.0 million), partially offset by 2009 customer contract termination and restructuring agreements ($27.8 million) and increased commodity costs in the 2010 ($20.8 million).In the Midwestern U.S. Mining segment, a higher weighted average sales price ($98.5 million), as discussed above, was partially offset by lower volumes ($42.3 million) due to decreased demand and increased costs on lower productivity due to compliance measures and geological conditions at certain underground mines.Our Trading and Brokerage segment was down primarily due to the lower revenues as discussed above.Income From Continuing Operations Before Income TaxesThe following table presents income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA$2,193.4 $1,607.3 $586.1 36.5%Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA(1)(354.7) (344.5) (10.2) 3.0%Depreciation, depletion and amortization(437.1) (400.5) (36.6) 9.1%Asset retirement obligation expense(47.2) (39.9) (7.3) 18.3%Interest expense(222.0) (201.1) (20.9) 10.4%Interest income9.6 8.1 1.5 18.5%Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,142.0 $629.4 $512.6 81.4%(1) Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA results include selling and administrative expenses, equity income (loss) from our joint ventures, certain asset sales, resource management costs and revenue, coal royalty expense, costs associated with past mining obligations, expenses related to our other commercial activities such as generation development and Btu Conversion costs and provision for certain litigation.Income from continuing operations before income taxes was higher compared to 2009 primarily due to the higher Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA discussed above, partially offset by lower Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA and higher depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and interest expense as discussed below:Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA: higher expense was primarily driven by an increase in selling and administrative expenses due to costs to support our business development and international expansion (e.g. headcount, travel, professional services, legal). We also incurred increased post mining costs driven by higher retiree healthcare amortization of actuarial losses and interest cost. These items were partially offset by improved results from equity affiliates primarily due to 2009 losses of $54.6 million related to our equity investment in Carbones del Guasare, which included a $34.7 million impairment loss and $19.9 million of operating losses. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.Depreciation, depletion and amortization: higher compared to 2009 due to increased production at our Australian mines with higher per ton depletion rates reflecting higher demand and additional depreciation expense associated with our new Bear Run Mine (commissioned in the second quarter of 2010).Interest expense: higher primarily due to refinancing charges ($9.3 million) associated with our new five year Credit Facility and charges ($8.4 million) associated with the extinguishment and refinancing of $650.0 million of senior notes.46Table of ContentsNet Income Attributable to Common StockholdersThe following table presents net income attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease)to Income 2010 2009 $ % (Dollars in millions) Income from continuing operations before income taxes$1,142.0 $629.4 $512.6 81.4 %Income tax provision315.4 186.2 129.2 69.4 %Income from continuing operations, net of income taxes826.6 443.2 383.4 86.5 %(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes(24.4) 19.8 (44.2) (223.2)%Net income802.2 463.0 339.2 73.3 %Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests28.2 14.8 13.4 90.5 %Net income attributable to common stockholders$774.0 $448.2 $325.8 72.7 %Net income attributable to common stockholders increased compared to 2009 due to the increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as discussed above.Income tax provision was impacted by the following:Increased expense due to higher earnings ($179.4 million) and income tax resulting from foreign earnings repatriation ($84.5 million), partially offset byA change in the valuation allowance ($46.0 million) related primarily to alternative minimum tax credits, lower expense associated with the remeasurement of non U.S. tax accounts as a result of the larger increase in the Australian exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in 2009 compared to 2010 ($26.5 million) as set forth in the table below, the favorable rate difference resulting from higher foreign generated income in 2010 ($41.1 million), and lower expense in 2010 due to the reduction of our gross unrecognized tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination of the 2005 federal income tax year ($15.2 million).

The increase is reflected in Other current assets and Investments and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.Outlook Our near term outlook is intended to address the next 12 24 months, with any subsequent periods addressed in our long term outlook. 47Table of ContentsNear Term Outlook Global coal consumption rose in 2011 to an estimated 7.7 billion tonnes, driven by increased coal use in China, India and other developing Asian nations. Global seaborne demand rose an estimated 6% and exceeded 1 billion tonnes, led by an increase in thermal demand to supply approximately 81 gigawatts of new coal fueled electricity generation brought on line in 2011. In the U.S., coal markets have been marked by a weak economy, low electricity generation and depressed near term natural gas prices. U.S. coal electricity generation declined an estimated 6% in 2011 driven by more mild weather as compared to the prior year as well as some displacement from hydro and natural gas, while U.S. coal exports increased 28% to an estimated 108 million tons.The International Monetary Funds January 2012 World Economic Outlook estimates global economic activity, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), will grow 3.3% in 2012 and 3.9% in 2013, led by China and India. Chinas GDP is projected to grow 8.2% in 2012 and 8.8% in 2013. India, the worlds second fastest growing economy, is projected to grow 7.0% in 2012 and 7.3% in 2013.According to the World Steel Association, global steel use is expected to increase 5.4% in 2012, with China expected to grow its steel use by 6.0%.Prices for global seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal have come down from record highs during 2011, though recent settlements have still been higher than historical averages. Metallurgical coal prices for high quality hard coking coal and LV PCI settled at $235 and $171 per tonne, respectively, for quarterly contracts commencing January 2012. We have settled first quarter metallurgical coal shipments in line with these recent settlements, with essentially all remaining 2012 metallurgical coal production unpriced. We expect near term macroeconomic movements to dictate quarterly pricing for the remainder of 2012 and we are targeting total 2012 metallurgical coal sales of approximately 14 to 15 million tons.Seaborne thermal coal originating from Newcastle, Australia, has been settled for annual contracts beginning in January 2012 at $116 per tonne. As of January 24, 2012, we had 40% to 50% of 2012 seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in Australia and we are targeting 2012 Australian thermal exports of 12 to 13 million tons.Looking at U.S. markets, the Energy Information Administrations (EIA) February 2012 Short Term Energy Outlook projects 2012 U.S. electric power coal consumption to decline by approximately 2%. U.S. coal production is also expected to decline by 2%, despite slight production expansion in the Western region. U.S. producers will look to increase exports as domestic markets remain weak relative to historic levels and global seaborne thermal markets provide growing sales opportunities.The coal fueled electric power generation decline in 2012 is projected to be primarily driven by depressed near term natural gas prices that are resulting in elevated levels of coal to gas switching, with the largest impact projected to be on Central Appalachian coal supply. If coal to gas switching lasts for a prolonged period during 2012 due to significantly depressed natural gas prices, there may be more substantial unfavorable impacts to all coal supply regions, including the Powder River Basin. We continually adjust our production levels in response to changes in market demand.We are targeting our U.S. volumes in 2012 to be on par with prior year levels and are fully committed on pricing. As of January 24, 2012, we had 45% to 55% of planned U.S. production unpriced for 2013. As a result of the current weak U.S. coal market environment, some customers may attempt to delay and or cancel portions of contracted 2012 volumes. Our coal supply agreement contractual terms and conditions provide support for us to seek full performance from all customers. In selected cases, we may elect to reach agreement with customers on monetary settlements and or contract extensions for 2013 and beyond in exchange for relief on 2012 volumes. Macarthur is expected to contribute less than $100 million of EBITDA in 2012 given the significant cost increases necessary to correct overburden deficiencies at the Coppabella Mine and to complete major repairs at both the Coppabella and Moorvale mines that had been deferred under previous management. We expect that these expenditures will allow us to enter 2013 with a solid foundation for higher productivity, lower costs, and improved financial performance. In addition, we expect to incur increased depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in 2012 and beyond driven by a higher average depletion rate associated with the acquisition of Macarthur. As discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources our debt service cost will also increase as a result of the debt incurred to fund the acquisition of Macarthur.48Table of ContentsWe continue to manage costs and operating performance in an effort to mitigate external cost pressures, geologic issues and potential shipping delays resulting from adverse port and rail performance. We may have higher per ton costs as a result of suboptimal production levels due to market driven changes in demand. We may also encounter poor geologic conditions, lower third party contract miner or brokerage performance or unforeseen equipment problems that limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels. To the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases, or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties, our operating margins would be negatively impacted. Reductions in the relative cost of other fuels, including natural gas, could impact the use of coal for electricity generation. See Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for additional considerations regarding our outlook.Dodd Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd Frank Act was enacted, which includes a number of provisions applicable to us in the areas of corporate governance, executive compensation and mine safety and extractive industries disclosure. In addition, the Dodd Frank Act imposes additional regulation of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. Although the Dodd Frank Act generally became effective upon its enactment, many provisions have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and require further action by the federal regulatory authorities. As a result, the ultimate impact of the Dodd Frank Act on us will not be fully known for an extended period of time. We do expect that the Dodd Frank Act will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and Trading and Brokerage activities.European Union Derivatives Regulation. In October 2011, the European Commission adopted proposals to revise its directive on markets in financial instruments (MiFID) and to enact a new regulation on markets in financial instruments (MiFIR). These proposals, which are currently under negotiation by the European Commission, European Council and European Parliament, will likely impose additional regulation of financial derivatives transactions that may apply to our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities. While the ultimate impact of these proposals will not be known for some time, we do expect that they will increase compliance and transaction costs associated with our hedging and our Trading and Brokerage activities.Minerals Resource Rent Tax. On May 2, 2010, the Australian government released a report on Australias Future Tax System, which included a recommendation to replace the current resource taxing arrangements imposed on non renewable resources by the Australian federal and state governments with a super profit resource rent tax (the Resource Tax) imposed and administered by the Australian government. As proposed, the Resource Tax would be profit based and would apply to non renewable resources projects, including existing projects. On July 2, 2010, the Australian government announced changes to the Resource Tax and proposed a new minerals resource rent tax (the MRRT). The MRRT would still be profit based, but measures were introduced to lessen the impact of the MRRT. The Australian government and major industry policy makers are actively engaged to work through various structural aspects of the proposed MRRT together with detailed implementation issues. A committee charged with consulting with industry and preparing recommendations as to the final form of the MRRT submitted its report in late December 2010. That committees recommendations largely endorsed the mining industrys understanding as to what was agreed with the federal government prior to the federal election. In March 2011, those recommendations were accepted by the federal government, which included the recommendation that all state royalties (current and future) are creditable against MRRT payments. An implementation group was formed, which included industry participants, to assist with drafting the legislation. Draft legislation and an accompanying explanatory memorandum was released for public consultation on June 7, 2011. The final exposure draft was released for further consultation on September 16, 2011 with legislation formally submitted to the House of Representatives in November 2011. The legislation was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on November 21, 2011 with the committee due to report back to the Senate on March 14, 2012. If the MRRT becomes law, the MRRT will apply to mining profits attributable to the value of resources earned after July 1, 2012 and may affect the level of taxation incurred by our Australian operations going forward.Carbon Pricing Framework. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Australian government passed a legislative package that included a carbon pricing framework that commences July 1, 2012. The carbon price will initially be $23.00 Australian dollars per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, escalated by 2.5% per year for inflation over a three year period. After June 30, 2015, the carbon price mechanism will transition to an emissions trading scheme. We believe that all of our Australian operations will be impacted by the fugitive emissions portion of the framework (defined as the methane and carbon dioxide which escapes into the atmosphere when coal is mined and gas is produced), which we estimate will initially average $2.00 to $3.25 Australian dollars per tonne of coal produced annually. Actual results will be dependent upon the volume of tons produced at each of our mining locations as the impact per tonne at our surface mines will generally be less than the impact per tonne at our underground mines. In addition, our Australian mines will be impacted by the phased reduction of the governments diesel fuel rebate to capture emissions from fuel combustion. Our North Goonyella, Wambo and Metropolitan mines will be eligible to apply for a portion of the governments approximately $1.3 billion Australian dollars of transition benefits that would provide assistance based on historical emissions intensity data to the most emissions intensive coal mines over a six year period.49Table of ContentsCross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). On July 6, 2011, the U.S. EPA finalized CSAPR, which requires 28 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to significantly improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and or fine particle pollution in other states. The CSAPR is one of a number of significant regulations that the EPA has issued or expects to issue that will impose more stringent requirements relating to air, water and waste controls on electric generating units. Under the CSAPR, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions would commence in 2012 with further reductions effective in 2014. In October 2011, the EPA proposed amendments to the CSAPR to increase emission budgets in ten states, including Texas, and ease limits on market based compliance options. While CSAPR had an initial compliance deadline of January 1, 2012, the rule was challenged and on December 30, 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed CSAPR and advised that the EPA is expected to continue administering CAIR until the pending challenges are resolved. Expedited briefing on the merits of the challenge is underway. We continue to evaluate the possible scenarios associated with the CSAPR and the impacts it may have on our business and our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Long Term Outlook Our long term global outlook remains positive. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2011, coal has been the fastest growing fuel in the world for the past decade.The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates in its World Energy Outlook 2011, current policies scenario, that world primary energy demand will grow 51% between 2009 and 2035. Demand for coal is projected to rise 65%, and the growth in global electricity generation from coal is expected to be greater than the growth in oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydro, biomass, geothermal and solar combined. China and India account for more than 75% of the 2009 2035 coal based primary energy demand growth. Under the current policies scenario, the IEA expects coal to retain its strong presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide. Coals share of the power generation mix was 47% in 2009. By 2035, the IEA estimates coals fuel share of power generation to be 49% as it continues to have the largest share of worldwide electric power production. According to industry reports, approximately 370 gigawatts of coal fueled electricity generating plants are currently planned or under construction around the world with expected completion between 2012 and 2016. Based on those estimates, when complete, those plants would require an estimated 1.2 billion tonnes of coal annually. In the U.S., while coal based plant retirements are expected, the EIA is projecting coal demand to remain relatively constant through 2015. The IEA projects that global natural gas fueled electricity generation will have a compound annual growth rate of 2.7%, from 4.3 trillion kilowatt hours in 2009 to 8.7 trillion kilowatt hours in 2035. The total amount of electricity generated from natural gas is expected to be approximately one half the total for coal, even in 2035. Renewables are projected to comprise 23% of the 2035 fuel mix versus 19% in 2009. Nuclear power is expected to grow 50%, however its share of total generation is expected to fall from 13.5% to 10% between 2009 and 2035. The recent events in Japan and Germany may impact these projections. Generation from liquid fuels is projected to decline an average of 2.1% annually to 1.5% of the 2035 generation mix.We believe that Btu Conversion applications such as coal to gas (CTG) and CTL plants represent an avenue for potential long term industry growth. Several CTG and CTL facilities are currently under development in China and India. We continue to support clean coal technology development toward the ultimate goal of near zero emissions, and we are advancing more than a dozen projects and partnerships in the U.S., China and Australia. Clean coal technology development in the U.S. has funding earmarked under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In addition, the Interagency Task Force on Carbon Capture and Storage was formed to develop a comprehensive and coordinated federal strategy surrounding the commercial development of commercial carbon capture and storage projects. Our work in new or recently commercialized technologies could expose us to unanticipated risks, evolving legislation and uncertainty regarding the extent of future government support and funding.Our long term plans also include advancing projects to expand our presence in the Asia Pacific region, some of which include sourcing coal to be sold through our Trading and Brokerage segment and partnerships to utilize our mining experience for joint mine development. In July 2011, we entered into a framework agreement to pursue development of a 50 million ton per year surface mine in Xinjiang, China. Also in July 2011, we were selected to be part of a consortium to develop the Tavan Tolgoi coking coal reserve in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The Government of Mongolia continues to evaluate the structure and components of the mine development, and we are negotiating with other parties and the Government of Mongolia regarding long term agreements related to the project. Any agreements would then be submitted for consideration and approval by government agencies and the Parliament of Mongolia.50Table of ContentsEnactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S. or some of its states or by other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in, the state of commercial development and deployment of CCS technologies and the alternative markets for coal. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors, it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapital ResourcesOur primary sources of cash are the sales of our coal production to customers and from the cash generated from our trading and brokerage activities. To a lesser extent, we also generate cash from the sale of non strategic coal reserves and surface land and from financing transactions. Along with cash and cash equivalents, our liquidity includes the available balances from our Revolver under our Credit Facility, an accounts receivable securitization program and a bank overdraft facility in Australia. Our available liquidity as of December 31, 2011 was $2.3 billion, which included cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 billion, $1.5 billion available for borrowing under the Revolver, net of outstanding letters of credit of $21.0 million, and available capacity under our accounts receivable securitization program of $41.7 million, net of outstanding letters of credit and amounts drawn. Our liquidity is also impacted by activity under certain bilateral cash collateralization arrangements. We assumed Macarthurs three year $330.0 million Australian dollar Corporate Funding Facility (Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility) as part of the acquisition that has a maturity date of November 30, 2013. As of December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings under the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility. The Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility has a $130.0 million Australian dollar sub limit for bank guarantees, leaving an available capacity of $200.0 million Australian dollars at December 31, 2011. Letters of credit and cash backed bank guarantees totaling $65.0 million Australian dollars were outstanding as of December 31, 2011. We plan to terminate the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility in 2012.As of December 31, 2011, approximately $284 million of our cash was held in the U.S. with approximately $515 million held by foreign subsidiaries, primarily those in our Australia Mining segment. Nearly all of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars and is subject to additional U.S. income taxes if repatriated. The cash held in Australia is currently expected to be used to fund, in part, our organic growth projects, sustaining capital expenditures and existing operations. We currently expect that our available liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements during the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. In addition to the above, alternative sources of liquidity include our ability to offer and sell securities under our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC. Capital RequirementsOur primary uses of cash include the cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, coal reserve lease and royalty payments, debt service costs (interest and principal), lease obligations, take or pay obligations and costs related to past mining obligations. When in compliance with the financial covenants and customary default provisions of our Credit Facility and 2011 Term Loan Facility, we are not restricted in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase capital stock provided that we may only redeem and repurchase capital stock with the proceeds received from the concurrent issue of capital stock or indebtedness permitted under the Credit Facility and 2011 Term Loan Facility.Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures for 2012 are anticipated to be $1.2 to $1.4 billion. Approximately $800 to $950 million is earmarked for growth projects that encompass future mine development, as well as the expansion and extension of existing mines, with much of the remaining allocated to sustaining capital expenditures for existing operations. The increase in planned capital expenditures for 2012 compared to 2011 is due to the continued advancement of multiple organic growth projects at our Millennium, Metropolitan and Burton mines. Approximately 75% of the growth and expansion capital is targeted for various Australian projects for metallurgical and thermal coal, with the remainder in the U.S. Our 2012 capital expenditures will include spending to begin converting two of our Australian mines from contract mining to owner operations. 51Table of ContentsFederal Coal Lease Expenditures. We currently anticipate that our federal coal lease expenditures will be $42.1 million in 2012 and for each of the next three years. These expenditures may increase in 2012 and beyond depending upon our participation in and the successful bidding on future federal coal leases.Dividends. We have declared and paid quarterly dividends since our initial public offering in 2001. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.085 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2012. The declaration and payment of dividends and the amount of dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, any limitations imposed by our debt instruments and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.Pension Contributions. During 2011, we made contributions of $46.7 million. In 2012, our anticipated pension contributions needed to be at or above the Pension Protection Act thresholds is approximately $5 million.Share Repurchase Program. At December 31, 2011, our available capacity for share repurchases was $700.4 million, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has authority to direct us to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock outside of the share repurchase program. While no such share repurchases were made in 2011, repurchases may be made from time to time based on an evaluation of our outlook and general business conditions, as well as alternative investment and debt repayment options.NCIG. Financing for phase one of stage two of construction closed in 2010 with us providing our pro rata share of funding of $59.7 million Australian dollars ($54.8 million U.S. dollars). NCIG may further expand the coal transloading facilitys capacity which could require us to fund our pro rata share in a similar manner.Debt Service Costs. With the acquisition of Macarthur in 2011, our debt service costs increased with the addition of $4.1 billion of new debt that included the following.A 2011 Term Loan Facility of $1.0 billion with an interest rate payable of LIBOR plus 2.0%, or 2.26% (as of December 31, 2011) and a maturity date of October 28, 2016; 6.00% Senior Notes of $1.6 billion due November 2018 (the 6.00% Senior Notes), with interest payable on May15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May15, 2012; and6.25% Senior Notes of $1.5 billion due November 2021 (the 6.25% Senior Notes), with interest payable on May15 and November 15 of each year, commencing May15, 2012.While these new debt instruments increased the annual amount of interest to be paid for 2012 and beyond, only the 2011 Term Loan Facility resulted in a $50.0 million increase to our annual amount of principal to be paid ($37.5 million in 2012). See the Contractual Obligations section for our estimated debt service costs as of December 31, 2011 for the next five years and thereafter. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on all of our outstanding debt.On November 15, 2011, we, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers of the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement). Subject to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, we will use our reasonable best efforts to register with the SEC exchange notes having substantially identical terms as the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes and to exchange freely tradable exchange notes for such notes within 365 days after the issue date of the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes (effectiveness target date). If we fail to meet the effectiveness target date (a registration default), the annual interest rate on the 6.00% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes will increase by 0.25% for each 90 day period during which the default continues, up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.0% until the registration default is cured.52Table of ContentsOur total indebtedness as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, consisted of the following: December 31, 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions)Term Loan$468.8 $493.82011 Term Loan Facility1,000.0 5.875% Senior Notes due April 2016 218.17.375% Senior Notes due November 2016650.0 650.06.00% Senior Notes due November 20181,600.0 6.50% Senior Notes due September 2020650.0 650.06.25% Senior Notes due November 20211,500.0 7.875% Senior Notes due November 2026247.3 247.2Convertible Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066375.2 373.3Capital lease obligations122.8 69.6Fair value hedge adjustment 2.2Other43.4 45.8Total$6,657.5 $2,750.0We were in compliance with all of the covenants of the Credit Facility, the 2011 Term Loan Facility, the 7.375% Senior Notes, the 6.00% Senior Notes, the 6.50% Senior Notes, the 6.25% Senior Notes, the 7.875% Senior Notes and the Debentures as of December 31, 2011. As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time repurchase debt securities issued by us, in private negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.Margin. As part of our trading and brokerage activities, we may be required to post margin with an exchange or one of our counterparties. The amount and timing of margin posted can vary with the volume of trades and market price volatility. Total margin held at December 31, 2011 was $18.1 million as compared to total margin posted of $192.1 million at December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash inflows for margin were $210.2 million. Net cash outflows for margin were $161.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.Shelf Registration. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC for an indeterminate number of securities that is effective for three years (expires August 7, 2012), at which time we expect to be able to file an automatic shelf registration statement that would become immediately effective for another three year term. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time: securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units.Historical Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) toCash Flow 2011 2010 $ % (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities$1,633.2 $1,087.1 $546.1 50.2 %Net cash used in investing activities(3,807.8) (703.6) (3,104.2) 441.2 %Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities1,678.5 (77.1) 1,755.6 (2,277.0)%Operating Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:Higher cash inflows associated with a return of margin posted on trading activities;Increased operating cash flows generated from our Australian Mining operations driven by higher pricing; andA prior year decrease in the utilization of our accounts receivable securitization program. 53Table of ContentsInvesting Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:$2.8 billion for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Macarthur; and Higher current year capital spending, including Prairie State, of $259.2 million related primarily to our expansion projects in Australia, partially offset by prior year spending to establish and ramp up operations at our Bear Run Mine.Financing Activities. The changes from the prior year were due to the following:A net increase in borrowings of long term debt compared to 2010 of $3.9 billion driven by the $4.1 billion of debt proceeds that were used, in part, to fund the Macarthur acquisition; andAcquisition of noncontrolling interests of $2.0 billion.Contractual ObligationsThe following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011: Payments Due By Year Total Less than1 Year 2 3Years 4 5Years More than5 Years (Dollars in millions)Long term debt obligations (principal and interest)$10,704.2 $458.8 $961.1 $2,722.8 $6,561.5Capital lease obligations (principal and interest)142.0 32.3 67.2 20.8 21.7Operating lease obligations610.9 123.1 196.8 139.9 151.1Unconditional purchase obligations(1)1,313.0 743.6 569.4 Coal reserve lease and royalty obligations227.8 50.7 98.8 50.4 27.9Take or pay obligations(2)4,547.6 443.1 824.4 469.0 2,811.1Other long term liabilities(3)3,035.6 174.1 331.0 324.0 2,206.5Total contractual cash obligations$20,581.1 $2,025.7 $3,048.7 $3,726.9 $11,779.8(1) We have purchase agreements with approved vendors for most types of operating expenses. However, our specific open purchase orders (which have not been recognized as a liability) under these purchase agreements, combined with any other open purchase orders, are not material. The commitments in the table above relate to capital purchases. The purchase obligations for capital expenditures relate to new mines and expansion and extension projects in Australia and the U.S.(2) Represents various long and short term take or pay arrangements associated with rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal including amounts relating to export facilities. Also includes commitments under electricity, water and coal washing agreements with joint ventures. (3) Represents long term liabilities relating to our postretirement benefit plans, work related injuries and illnesses, defined benefit pension plans, mine reclamation and end of mine closure costs and exploration obligations.We do not expect any of the $119.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits reported in our consolidated financial statements to require cash settlement within the next year. Beyond that, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of periodic cash settlements with respect to such unrecognized tax benefits.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees, indemnifications, financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds and our accounts receivable securitization program. Assets and liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements.54Table of ContentsAccounts Receivable Securitization. We have an accounts receivable securitization program (securitization program) with a maximum capacity of $275.0 million through our wholly owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiary (Seller). At December 31, 2011, we had $41.7 million available under the securitization program, net of outstanding letters of credit and amounts drawn. Under the securitization program, we contribute, on a revolving basis, trade receivables of most of our U.S. subsidiaries to the Seller, which then sells the receivables in their entirety to a consortium of unaffiliated asset backed commercial paper conduits (the Conduits). After the sale, we, as servicer of the assets, collect the receivables on behalf of the Conduits for a nominal servicing fee. We utilize proceeds from the sale of our accounts receivable as an alternative to short term borrowings under the Revolver portion of our Credit Facility, effectively managing our overall borrowing costs and providing an additional source for working capital. The current securitization program extends to May 2012, while the letter of credit commitment that supports the commercial paper facility underlying the securitization program must be renewed annually.The Seller is a separate legal entity whose assets are available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Of the receivables sold to the Conduits, a portion of the amount due to the Seller is deferred until the ultimate collection of the underlying receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received total consideration of $4,633.4 million related to accounts receivable sold under the securitization program, including $3,462.7 million of cash up front from the sale of the receivables, an additional $1,004.8 million of cash upon the collection of the underlying receivables, and $165.9 million that had not been collected at December 31, 2011 and was recorded at fair value which approximates carrying value. The reduction in accounts receivable as a result of securitization activity with the Conduits was $150.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010.The securitization activity has been reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows as an operating activity because both the cash received from the Conduits upon sale of receivables as well as the cash received from the Conduits upon the ultimate collection of receivables are not subject to significantly different risks given the short term nature of our trade receivables. We recorded expense associated with securitization transactions of $2.0 million, $2.4 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Other Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. From time to time, we enter into coal offtake agreements with counterparties where, as a part of the arrangements, we may provide certain financial guarantees on behalf of the counterparties. As of December 31, 2011, we had in place guarantees of $10.0 million on behalf of our counterparties relating to such agreements. To mitigate risk, we place liens on the counterparties production equipment or require performance bonds. In January 2011, we entered into a bilateral cash collateralization agreement in support of certain letters of credit whereby we posted cash collateral in lieu of utilizing our Credit Facility. The capacity under this new agreement is $37.0 million, all of which was posted as collateral at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had a total of $79.7 million posted as collateral under such agreements. The cash collateral is classified within "Cash and cash equivalents" given our ability to substitute letters of credit at any time for this cash collateral.As discussed above in Capital Resources, we also had $65.0 million (Australian dollars) of letters of credit and cash backed bank guarantees outstanding under the Macarthur Corporate Funding Facility at December 31, 2011.See Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our guarantees.55Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We are also required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.Postretirement Benefit and Pension Liabilities. We have long term liabilities for our employees postretirement benefit costs and defined benefit pension plans. Detailed information related to these liabilities is included in Notes 14 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements. Liabilities for postretirement benefit costs are not funded. Our pension obligations are funded in accordance with the provisions of applicable law. Expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 for pension and postretirement liabilities totaled $119.7 million, while funding payments were $112.8 million.Each of these liabilities is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate and future cost trends, to estimate the costs and obligations for these items. Our discount rate is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liabilities.We make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care and work related injuries and illnesses obligations. Our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data. In addition, we make assumptions related to future compensation increases and rates of return on plan assets in the estimates of pension obligations.If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations. For our postretirement health care liability, assumed discount rates and health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the expense and liability amounts reported for health care plans. Below we have provided two separate sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the significance of these assumptions in relation to reported amounts.Health care cost trend rate:For Year Ended December 31, 2011 One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease (Dollars in millions)Effect on total service and interest cost components(1)$8.2 $(6.9)Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1)$121.8 $(104.6)Discount rate:For Year Ended December 31, 2011 One HalfPercentage Point Increase One HalfPercentage Point Decrease (Dollars in millions)Effect on total service and interest cost components(1)$0.7 $(0.7)Effect on total postretirement benefit obligation(1)$(56.8) $64.8(1) In addition to the effect on total service and interest cost components of expense, changes in trend and discount rates would also increase or decrease the actuarial gain or loss amortization expense component. The gain or loss amortization would approximate the increase or decrease in the obligation divided by 11.70 years at January 1, 2012.56Table of ContentsAsset Retirement Obligations. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates for surface land reclamation and support facilities at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the U.S. and Australia as defined by each mining permit. Asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions including, among other items, estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data, estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows, discounted using a credit adjusted, risk free rate. As changes in estimates occur (such as mine plan revisions, changes in estimated costs, or changes in timing of the reclamation activities), the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted, risk free rate. If our assumptions do not materialize as expected, actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated. Moreover, regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform reclamation and mine closing activities. Asset retirement obligation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $53.1 million, and payments totaled $16.9 million. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our asset retirement obligations.Income Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. The guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance, we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position must be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the judgments and estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ.Business Combinations. We account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase method requires us to determine the fair value of all acquired assets, including identifiable intangible assets, and all assumed liabilities. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment, and the utilization of independent valuation experts, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, and asset lives, among other items.Level 3 Fair Value Measurements. In accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, we evaluate the quality and reliability of the assumptions and data used to measure fair value in the three level hierarchy, Levels 1, 2 and 3. Level 3 fair value measurements are those where inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot be market corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants. Commodity swaps and options and physical commodity purchase/sale contracts transacted in less liquid markets or contracts, such as long term arrangements, with limited price availability were classified in Level 3. Indicators of less liquid markets are those with periods of low trade activity or when broker quotes reflect wide pricing spreads. Generally, these instruments or contracts are valued using internally generated models that include forward pricing curve quotes from one to three reputable brokers. Our valuation techniques also include basis adjustments for heat rate, sulfur and ash content, port and freight costs, and credit and nonperformance risk. We validate our valuation inputs with third party information and settlement prices from other sources where available. We also consider credit and nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement by analyzing the counterpartys exposure balance, credit rating and average default rate, net of any counterparty credit enhancements (e.g., collateral), as well as our own credit rating for financial derivative liabilities.We have consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented, and believe we have obtained the most accurate information reasonably available for the types of derivative contracts held. Valuation changes from period to period for each level will increase or decrease depending on: (i) the relative change in fair value for positions held, (ii) new positions added, (iii) realized amounts for completed trades, and (iv) transfers between levels. Our coal trading strategies utilize various swaps and derivative physical contracts. Periodic changes in fair value for purchase and sale positions, which are executed to lock in coal trading spreads, occur in each level and therefore the overall change in value of our coal trading platform requires consideration of valuation changes across all levels.57Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2011 and 2010, 1% ($8.7 million) and 3% ($18.6 million), respectively, of our net financial assets were categorized as Level 3. See Notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements.Newly Adopted Accounting Standards and Accounting Standards Not Yet ImplementedSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of newly adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements not yet implemented.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe potential for changes in the market value of our coal and freight trading, crude oil, diesel fuel, natural gas, explosives, interest rate and currency portfolios is referred to as market risk. Market risk related to our coal trading and freight portfolio, which includes bilaterally settled and exchange settled over the counter trading as well as brokered trading of coal, is evaluated using a value at risk (VaR) analysis. VaR analysis is not used to evaluate our non trading interest rate, diesel fuel, explosives and currency hedging portfolios or coal trading activities we employ in support of coal production (as discussed below). We attempt to manage market risks through diversification, controlling position sizes and executing hedging strategies. Due to lack of quoted market prices and the long term, illiquid nature of the positions, we have not quantified market risk related to our non trading, long term coal supply agreement portfolio.Coal Trading Activities and Related Commodity Price RiskCoal Price Risk Monitored Using VaR. We engage in direct and brokered trading of coal, ocean freight and fuel related commodities in over the counter markets. These activities give rise to commodity price risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by an adverse change in the market value of a particular commitment. We actively measure, monitor and adjust traded position levels to remain within risk limits prescribed by management. For example, we have policies in place that limit the amount of risk, as measured by VaR, that we may assume at any point in time on trading and brokerage activities.We account for coal trading using the fair value method, which requires us to reflect financial instruments with third parties at market value in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our trading portfolio included forwards, swaps and options as of December 31, 2011.The use of VaR allows us to quantify in dollars, on a daily basis, a measure of price risk inherent in our trading portfolio. VaR represents the expected loss in portfolio value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon (liquidation period) within a specified confidence level. Our VaR model is based on a variance/co variance approach. This captures our exposure related to forwards, swaps and options positions. Our VaR model calculates a 5 to 15 day holding period dependent upon the products within our portfolio at the time of VaR measurement and a 95% one tailed confidence interval. This means that there is a one in 20 statistical chance that the portfolio would lose more than the VaR estimates during the liquidation period. Our volatility calculation incorporates an exponentially weighted moving average algorithm based on the previous 60 market days, which makes our volatility more representative of recent market conditions, while still reflecting an awareness of historical price movements. VaR does not estimate the maximum loss expected in the 5% of the time the portfolio value exceeds measured VaR.The use of VaR allows us to aggregate pricing risks across products in the portfolio, compare risk on a consistent basis and identify the drivers of risk. We use historical data to estimate price volatility as an input to VaR. Given our reliance on historical data, we believe VaR is reasonably effective in characterizing risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Due to the subjectivity in the choice of the liquidation period, reliance on historical data to calibrate the models and the inherent limitations in the VaR methodology, we perform regular stress and scenario analyses to estimate the impacts of market changes on the value of the portfolio. Additionally, back testing is regularly performed to monitor the effectiveness of our VaR measure. The results of these analyses are used to supplement the VaR methodology and identify additional market related risks. An inherent limitation of VaR is that past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk.During the year ended December 31, 2011, the actual low, high, and average VaR was $3.5 million, $30.6 million and $13.4 million, respectively.58Table of ContentsOther Risk Exposures. We also use our coal trading and brokerage platform to support various coal production related activities. These transactions may involve coal to be produced from our mines, coal sourcing arrangements with third party mining companies, joint venture positions with producers or offtake agreements with producers. While the support activities (e.g. forward sale of coal to be produced and or purchased) may ultimately involve market risk sensitive instruments, the sourcing of coal in these arrangements does not involve market risk sensitive instruments and does not encompass the commodity price risks that we monitor through VaR, as discussed above.Future Realization. As of December 31, 2011, the timing of the estimated future realization of the value of our trading portfolio was as follows:Year ofPercentage ofExpirationPortfolio Total201265%201329%20144%20152% 100%We also monitor other types of risk associated with our coal trading activities, including credit, market liquidity and counterparty nonperformance.Nonperformance and Credit RiskCoal Trading. The fair value of our coal trading assets and liabilities reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. Our exposure is substantially with electric utilities, energy producers and energy marketers. Our policy is to independently evaluate each customers creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to regularly monitor the credit extended. If we engage in a transaction with a counterparty that does not meet our credit standards, we seek to protect our position by requiring the counterparty to provide an appropriate credit enhancement. Also, when appropriate (as determined by our credit management function), we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to customers or counterparties whose credit has deteriorated and who may pose a higher risk of failure to perform under their contractual obligations. These steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral (margin), requiring prepayments for shipments or the creation of customer trust accounts held for our benefit to serve as collateral in the event of a failure to pay or perform. To reduce our credit exposure related to trading and brokerage activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and, to the extent required, will post or receive margin amounts associated with exchange cleared positions.Non Coal Trading. The fair value of our non coal trading derivative assets and liabilities also reflects adjustments for nonperformance and credit risk. We conduct our hedging activities related to foreign currency, interest rate, fuel and explosives exposures with a variety of highly rated commercial banks and closely monitor counterparty creditworthiness. To reduce our credit exposure for these hedging activities, we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties.Foreign Currency Risk We utilize currency forwards to hedge currency risk associated with anticipated Australian dollar expenditures. The accounting for these derivatives is discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Assuming we had no hedges in place, our exposure in operating costs and expenses due to a $0.05 change in the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate is approximately $150 million for 2012. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to the same rate change is approximately $65 million for 2012. The table at the end of Item 7A shows the notional amount of our hedge contracts as of December 31, 2011.59Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskOur objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. From time to time, we manage our debt to achieve a certain ratio of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as a percent of net debt through the use of various hedging instruments, which are discussed in detail in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, we had $5.2 billion of fixed rate borrowings and $1.5 billion of variable rate borrowings outstanding and had no interest rate swaps in place. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an annualized increase to interest expense of approximately $15 million on our variable rate borrowings. With respect to our fixed rate borrowings, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately $338 million in the estimated fair value of these borrowings.Other Non trading Activities Commodity Price RiskLong Term Coal Contracts. We manage our commodity price risk for our non trading, long term coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements (those with terms longer than one year), rather than through the use of derivative instruments. Sales under such agreements comprised approximately 91%, 91% and 93% of our worldwide sales (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Substantially all of our coal in the U.S. is contracted in 2012 at planned production levels. We had 40% to 50% of seaborne thermal coal volumes available for pricing in at January 24, 2012. We expect near term macroeconomic movements to dictate quarterly metallurgical coal pricing for the remainder of the 2012 and we are targeting total 2012 metallurgical coal sales of approximately 14 to 15 million tons.Diesel Fuel and Explosives Hedges. We manage commodity price risk of the diesel fuel and explosives used in our mining activities through the use of cost pass through contracts and derivatives, primarily swaps.Notional amounts outstanding under fuel related, derivative swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 160 to 165 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2012. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a $10 per barrel change in the price of crude oil (the primary component of a refined diesel fuel product) would increase or decrease our annual diesel fuel costs by approximately $38 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of crude oil is approximately $15 million.Notional amounts outstanding under explosives related swap contracts are noted in the table at the end of Item 7A. We expect to consume 380,000 to 390,000 tons of explosives during 2012 in the U.S. Explosives costs in Australia are generally included in the fees paid to our contract miners. Assuming we had no hedges in place, a price change in natural gas (often a key component in the production of explosives) of one dollar per million MMBtu would result in an increase or decrease in our annual explosives costs of approximately $7 million based on our expected usage. However, taking into consideration hedges currently in place, our net exposure to changes in the price of natural gas is approximately $2 million.60Table of ContentsNotional Amounts and Fair Value.
