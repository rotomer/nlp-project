The Drivetrain segments products include all wheel drive transfer cases, torque management systems, and components and systems for automated transmissions. Stock Split On November 14, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on its common stock. To implement this stock split, shares of common stock were issued on December 17, 2007 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 6, 2007. All prior year share and per share amounts disclosed in this document have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview A summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is as follows: millions of dollars, except per share data Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 5,263.9 $ 5,328.6 $ 4,585.4 Cost of sales 4,425.4 4,378.7 3,735.5 Gross profit 838.5 949.9 849.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 542.9 531.9 498.1 Restructuring expense 127.5 84.7 Goodwill impairment charge 156.8 Other income (3.1 ) (6.8 ) (7.5 ) Operating income 14.4 424.8 274.6 Equity in affiliates earnings, net of tax (38.4 ) (40.3 ) (35.9 ) Interest expense and finance charges 38.8 34.7 40.2 Earnings before income taxes and minority interest 14.0 430.4 270.3 Provision for income taxes 33.3 113.9 32.4 Minority interest, net of tax 16.3 28.0 26.3 Net earnings (loss) $ (35.6 ) $ 288.5 $ 211.6 Earnings (loss) per share diluted $ (0.31 ) $ 2.45 $ 1.83 24 Table of Contents A summary of major factors impacting the Companys net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2008 in comparison to 2007 and 2006 is as follows: Global financial market and economic crisis in the second half of 2008 significantly impacted consumer demand for light vehicles and negatively impacted our sales. Continued demand for our products in both Engine and Drivetrain segments. Lower North American production of light trucks and SUVs. Continued benefits from our cost reduction programs, including containment of raw material and energy cost increases, health care cost inflation and the costs related to global expansion. Restructuring expenses in the third and fourth quarters of 2006 to adjust headcount and capacity levels, primarily in North America and primarily in the Drivetrain segment. Restructuring expenses in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 to adjust headcount and capacity levels, in North America, Europe and Asia. The write offs of the excess purchase price allocated to in process research and development (IPRD), order backlog and beginning inventory related to the 2007 acquisition of approximately 12.8% of BERU AG (BERU) stock and the 2008 completion of a Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement (DPTA) between the Company and BERU. The write offs of the excess purchase price allocated to IPRD, order backlog and beginning inventory related to the 2006 acquisition of the European Transmission and Engine Controls (ETEC) product lines from Eaton in Monaco. Favorable currency impact of $13.0 million, $15.2 million and $0.4 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Adjustments to tax accounts in 2008, 2007 and 2006 upon conclusion of certain tax audits and changes in circumstances, including changes in tax laws. An approximate $14 million provision in 2007 for a warranty related issue surrounding a product, built during a 15 month period in 2004 and 2005, that is no longer in production. An approximate $23.5 million warranty related issue associated with the companys transmission product sold in Europe, limited to mid 2007 through May 2008 production. An 111.5 million $(156.8 million) impairment charge in 2008 to adjust BERUs goodwill to its estimated fair value. Recognition in 2008 of a $4.0 million charge related to an untimely change in the level of benefits provided to BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc (DTP) retirees. The establishment of a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards in 2008 of $13.5 million. 25 Table of Contents The Companys earnings (loss) per diluted share were $(0.31), $2.45 and $1.83 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non recurring or non comparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Non recurring or non comparable items: Goodwill impairment charge $ (1.35 ) $ $ Restructuring expense (0.72 ) (0.41 ) Transmission product related warranty charge (0.14 ) Tax valuation allowance (0.12 ) Write off of the excess purchase price allocated to IPRD, order backlog and beginning inventory associated with acquisitions (0.04 ) (0.02 ) (0.02 ) Net gain from divestitures 0.03 Adjustments to tax accounts 0.02 0.03 0.19 Retiree healthcare litigation outcome (0.03 ) Total impact to earnings per share diluted: $ (2.38 ) $ 0.01 $ (0.21 ) The Companys effective tax rate, after giving tax effect to the non recurring or non comparable items shown above, was 23.0%, 27.1%, and 26.0% for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Net Sales The table below summarizes the overall worldwide global light vehicle production percentage changes for 2008 and 2007: Worldwide Light Vehicle Year Over Year Increase (Decrease) in Production 2008 2007 North America* (15.8 )% (1.5 )% Europe* (4.5 )% 5.6 % Asia* 2.4 % 7.1 % Total Worldwide* (3.7 )% 5.0 % BorgWarner year over year net sales change (1.2 )% 16.2 % * Data provided by CSM Worldwide. Our net sales decrease in 2008 of 1.2% was slightly better than the estimated worldwide market production decrease of 3.7%. Our net sales increase in 2007 of 16.2% was strong in light of the estimated worldwide market production increase of 5.0%. The effect of changing currency rates had a positive impact on the Companys net sales and net earnings in 2008 and 2007. The effect of non U.S. currencies, primarily the Euro, increased net sales by $191.0 million and reduced the Companys net loss by $13.0 million in 2008. In 2007, non U.S. currencies, primarily the Euro, added $262.1 million to net sales and $15.2 million to net earnings. The year over year decrease in net sales, excluding the favorable impact of currency, was 4.8% in 2008. The year over year increase in net sales, excluding the favorable impact of currency, was 10.5% in 2007. Consolidated net sales included sales to Volkswagen of approximately 19%, 15%, and 13%; to Ford of approximately 9%, 12%, and 13%; and to Daimler of approximately 6%, 6%, and 11% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Daimler divested Chrysler in 2007. Both of our reporting segments had significant sales to all three of the customers listed above. Such sales consisted of a variety of products to a variety of customer locations and regions. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented. 26 Table of Contents Outlook The Company is very cautious about 2009. The recent crisis in the financial sector and deteriorating global economic conditions have increased uncertainty about automotive vehicle sales in every geographic region of the world. The Company expects the unprecedented current global economic environment to continue to affect near term results and to create difficult conditions through 2009. The Company maintains a positive long term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. The trends that are driving our long term growth are expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection diesel and gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of automated transmissions in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the move to chain engine timing systems in both Europe and Asia Pacific. The impact of non U.S. currencies is currently expected to be a decline in 2009. When the recovery from current global economic conditions occur, we expect long term sales and net earnings growth to resume to historical rates. Results By Reporting Segment The Companys business is comprised of two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems. The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after tax return on invested capital (ROIC) of its business initiatives. The ROIC is comprised of projected earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) adjusted for taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. EBIT is considered a non GAAP financial measure. Generally, a non GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBIT is defined as earnings before interest, taxes and minority interest. Earnings is intended to mean net earnings as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under GAAP. The Company believes that EBIT is useful to demonstrate the operational profitability of its segments by excluding interest and taxes, which are generally accounted for across the entire Company on a consolidated basis. EBIT is also one of the measures used by the Company to determine resource allocation within the Company. Although the Company believes that EBIT enhances understanding of its business and performance, it should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net earnings or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. The following tables present net sales and Segment EBIT by segment for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006: Net Sales millions of dollars Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Engine $ 3,861.5 $ 3,761.3 $ 3,154.9 Drivetrain 1,426.4 1,598.8 1,461.4 Inter segment eliminations (24.0 ) (31.5 ) (30.9 ) Net sales $ 5,263.9 $ 5,328.6 $ 4,585.4 27 Table of Contents Earnings Before Interest and Taxes millions of dollars Year Ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 Engine $ 394.9 $ 418.0 $ 365.8 Drivetrain (4.9 ) 118.1 90.6 Segment earnings before interest and taxes (Segment EBIT) 390.0 536.1 456.4 Restructuring expense (127.5 ) (84.7 ) Goodwill impairment charge (156.8 ) Corporate, including equity in affiliates earnings (52.9 ) (71.0 ) (61.2 ) Consolidated earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) 52.8 465.1 310.5 Interest expense and finance charges 38.8 34.7 40.2 Earnings before income taxes and minority interest 14.0 430.4 270.3 Provision for income taxes 33.3 113.9 32.4 Minority interest, net of tax 16.3 28.0 26.3 Net earnings (loss) $ (35.6 ) $ 288.5 $ 211.6 The Engine segment 2008 net sales were up 2.7% from 2007, with a 5.5% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period. The Engine segment continued to benefit from Asian automaker demand for turbochargers and timing systems, European automaker demand for turbochargers, timing systems, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves and diesel engine ignition systems. This benefit was offset by lower North American production of light truck and sport utility vehicles. The Segment EBIT margin was 10.2% in 2008, down from 11.1% in 2007 (which includes the one time write off in 2008 of the excess purchase price allocated to BERUs IPRD, order backlog and inventory), due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the U.S. and European markets, and increased costs for raw materials, principally steel. The Engine segment 2007 net sales were up 19.2% from 2006, with a 14.3% increase in Segment EBIT over the same period. The Engine segment continued to benefit from Asian automaker demand for turbochargers and timing systems, European automaker demand for turbochargers, timing systems, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves and diesel engine ignition systems, the continued roll out of its variable cam timing systems with General Motors high value V6 engines, stronger EGR valve sales in North America, and higher turbocharger and thermal products sales due to stronger global commercial vehicle production. The Segment EBIT margin was 11.1% in 2007 down from 11.6% in 2006 (which includes the one time write off in 2007 of the excess purchase price allocated to BERUs IPRD, order backlog and inventory), due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the U.S. market and increased costs for raw materials, principally nickel. The Drivetrain segment 2008 net sales decreased 10.8% from 2007 with a 104.1% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period. The group was negatively impacted by lower U.S. production of light trucks and SUVs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products. Segment EBIT margin was (0.3)% in 2008, down from 7.4% in the prior year, due to the combined effect of DCT product start up cost pressures and lower North American production of light trucks and sport utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products. The Drivetrain segment 2007 net sales increased 9.4% from 2006 with a 30.4% increase in Segment EBIT over the same period. The segment continued to benefit from growth outside of North America including the continued ramp up of dual clutch transmission and torque transfer product sales in Europe. In the U.S., the group was negatively impacted by lower production of light trucks and SUVs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products. Segment EBIT margin was 7.4% in 2007, up from 6.2% in the prior year, due to the benefits of restructuring in its North American operations and growth outside of the U.S. Corporate is the difference between calculated total Company EBIT and the total of the Segments EBIT. It represents corporate headquarters expenses, expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments and 28 Table of Contents equity in affiliates earnings. This net expense was $52.9 million in 2008, $71.0 million in 2007 and $61.2 million in 2006. Other Factors Affecting Results of Operations The following table details our results of operations as a percentage of sales: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 84.1 82.2 81.5 Gross profit 15.9 17.8 18.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 10.3 10.0 10.9 Restructuring expense 2.4 1.8 Goodwill impairment charge 3.0 Other income (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) Operating income 0.3 8.0 6.0 Equity in affiliates earnings, net of tax (0.7 ) (0.8 ) (0.8 ) Interest expense and finance charges 0.7 0.7 0.9 Earnings before income taxes and minority interest 0.3 8.1 5.9 Provision for income taxes 0.7 2.2 0.7 Minority interest, net of tax 0.3 0.5 0.6 Net earnings (loss) (0.7 )% 5.4 % 4.6 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 15.9%, 17.8% and 18.5% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our gross profit decrease in 2008 is due to unfavorable product mix as a result of the sudden decline in the North American and European automotive markets, including a 15.8% decrease in light truck and SUV production in North America. The Company has restructured its North American and European operations in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 to align the Companys workforce with forecasted production. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) as a percentage of net sales were 10.3%, 10.0% and 10.9% in 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively. The 2008 increase in SGA as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to $8.0 million of amortization for the recognition of the remaining 17.8% of the fair value of BERU. $3.3 million of the amortization recognized in the second quarter of 2008 is for the immediate write off of in process RD and order backlog, the remaining $4.7 million increase is amortization on other intangible assets. The Company also recorded an increase in bad debt expense of $2.7 million in 2008 related to a decline in the financial condition of certain customers. Research and development (RD) is a major component of our SGA expenses. RD spending, net of customer reimbursements, was $205.7 million, or 3.9% of sales in 2008, compared to $210.8 million, or 4.0% of sales in 2007, and $187.7 million, or 4.1% of sales in 2006. We currently intend to continue to increase our spending in RD, although the growth rate in the future may not necessarily match the rate of our sales growth. We also intend to continue to invest in a number of cross business RD programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short and long term growth. Our current long term expectation for RD spending is approximately 4.0% of sales. We intend to maintain our commitment to RD spending while continuing to focus on controlling other SGA costs. Restructuring expense of $127.5 million in 2008 and $84.7 million in 2006 was in response to declines in global customer production levels, customer restructurings and a subsequent evaluation of our headcount levels in North America, Europe and Asia (in 2008 only) and our long term capacity needs. On July 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring of its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing, fundamental market shift in the auto industry. As a continuation of the Companys third quarter restructuring, on December 11, 2008, the Company announced plans for additional restructuring actions. As a 29 Table of Contents result of these third and fourth quarter restructuring actions, the Company has reduced its North American workforce by approximately 2,400 people, or 33%; its European workforce by approximately 1,600 people, or 18%; and its Asian workforce by approximately 400 people, or 17%. The restructuring expense recognized for employee termination benefits is $54.6 million, of which $10.3 million was paid out in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The remaining liability will be paid out by the middle of 2010. In addition to employee termination costs, the Company recorded $72.9 million of asset impairment charges related to the North American and European restructuring. The combined restructuring expenses of $127.5 million are broken out by segment as follows: Engine $85.3 million, Drivetrain $40.9 million and Corporate $1.3 million. Refer to Note 19, Restructuring of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. On September 22, 2006, the Company announced the reduction of its North American workforce by approximately 850 people, or 13%, spread across its 19 operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. This third quarter reduction of the North American workforce addressed an immediate need to adjust employment levels to meet customer restructurings and significantly lower production schedules going forward. In addition to employee related costs of $6.7 million, the Company recorded $4.8 million of asset impairment charges related to the North American restructuring. The third quarter restructuring expenses of $11.5 million broken out by segment were as follows: Engine $7.3 million, Drivetrain $3.6 million and Corporate $0.6 million. During the fourth quarter 2006, the Company evaluated the competitiveness of its North American facilities, as well as its long term capacity needs. As a result, the Company will be closing the drivetrain plant in Muncie, Indiana and has adjusted the carrying values of other assets, primarily related to its four wheel drive transfer case product line. Production activity at the Muncie facility is scheduled to cease no later than the expiration of the current labor contract in April 24, 2009. As a result of the fourth quarter restructuring, the Company recorded employee related costs of $14.8 million, asset impairments of $51.6 million and pension curtailment expense of $6.8 million. The fourth quarter restructuring expenses of $73.2 million broken out by segment were as follows: Engine $5.9 million and Drivetrain $67.3 million. Other income was $(3.1) million, $(6.8) million and $(7.5) million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2008 income was comprised primarily of interest income, offset by the realization of a loss on the sale of a product line and other asset disposals. The 2007 income was comprised primarily of interest income. The 2006 income was comprised primarily of a $(4.8) million gain from a previous divestiture and $(3.2) million of interest income. Equity in affiliates earnings, net of tax was $38.4 million, $40.3 million and $35.9 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This line item is primarily driven by the results of our 50% owned Japanese joint venture, NSK Warner, and our 32.6% owned Indian joint venture, Turbo Energy Limited (TEL). For more discussion of NSK Warner, see Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense and finance charges were $38.8 million, $34.7 million and $40.2 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2008 expense over 2007 expense was primarily due to costs related to BERUs DPTA. The decrease in 2007 expense over 2006 expense was primarily due to reduced debt levels. The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate for 2008 of 237.9% compared with rates of 26.5% in 2007 and 12.0% in 2006. The effective tax rate of 237.9% for 2008 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the non deductibility of the $156.8 million impairment charge in 2008 related to BERU goodwill; a reduction in U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S.; the realization of certain business tax credits including RD and foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates earnings. If the effects of tax accrual changes and the Companys third quarter $13.5 million valuation allowance are not taken into account, the Companys effective tax rate associated with its on going business operations was 23.0%. This rate was lower than the 2007 tax rate for on going operations of 27.1% primarily due to the decline in U.S. earnings. Minority interest, net of tax of $16.3 million decreased by $11.7 million from 2007 and by $10.0 million from 2006. The decrease is primarily related to the Companys DPTA with BERU, giving BorgWarner full control of BERU. 30 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Capitalization millions of dollars 2008 2007 % Change Notes payable $ 183.8 $ 63.7 Current portion of long term debt 136.9 Long term debt 459.6 572.6 Total debt 780.3 636.3 22.6 % Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries 31.5 117.9 Total stockholders equity 2,006.0 2,321.1 Total capitalization $ 2,817.8 $ 3,075.3 (8.4 )% Total debt to capital ratio 27.7 % 20.7 % The Company intends to settle the current portion of long term debt (due February 17, 2009) of $136.9 million with cash on hand, cash from operations and affiliate dividend receipts. The $144.0 million increase in debt was primarily due to the $133.6 million acquisition of additional shares of BERU. Stockholders equity decreased by $315.1 million in 2008 as follows: millions of dollars Balance, January 1, 2008 $ 2,321.1 Net loss (35.6 ) Currency translation and hedged instruments (136.9 ) Defined benefit post employment plans (74.7 ) Treasury stock purchases, net of options exercised (40.9 ) Dividend payments (51.1 ) Other 24.1 Balance, December 31, 2008 $ 2,006.0 The currency translation component of other comprehensive income decreased in 2008 primarily due to the weakening of the Euro, Korean Won and British Pound in relation to the U.S. Dollar. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $400.8 million, $603.5 million and $442.1 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $202.7 million decrease in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital needs. The $161.4 million increase in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to higher earnings and improved working capital usage. The $400.8 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2008 consists of a net loss of $35.6 million, increased for non cash charges of $530.7 million and a $94.3 million decrease in net operating assets and liabilities. Non cash charges are primarily comprised of $286.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense and a $156.8 million goodwill impairment charge. Accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased a total of $163.9 million and $195.6 million, respectively, excluding the impact of currency, due to lower business levels, particularly in North America and Europe. Certain of our European customers tend to have longer payment terms than our North American customers. Inventory increased by $26.3 million excluding the impact of currency, while our full year average inventory turns decreased to 9.8 times from 10.5 in 2007. 31 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $485.1 million, $368.0 million and $341.1 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capital expenditures, including tooling outlays (capital spending) of $369.7 million in 2008, or 7.0% of sales, increased $75.8 million over the 2007 level of $293.9 million, or 5.5% of sales. Selective capital spending remains an area of focus for us, both in order to support our book of new business and for cost reduction and other purposes. Heading into 2009, we plan to continue to spend capital to support the launch of our new applications and for cost reductions and productivity improvement projects, but at levels considerably lower than 2008. In 2008, the Company purchased approximately 1.34 million BERU shares, at a cost of $133.6 million. See Note 20, Recent Transactions for further information. The Company acquired approximately 12.8% of additional BERU shares in 2007 for $138.8 million, including transaction fees. In 2006, the Company acquired the ETEC product lines from Eaton for $63.7 million, net of cash acquired. Financing Activities and Liquidity Liquidity: The Company had $103.4 million of cash on hand at December 31, 2008. The Company has a multi currency revolving credit facility, which provides for borrowings up to $600 million through July 22, 2009. We intend to extend or renew our existing multi currency credit facility with terms sufficient for our ongoing financing needs before July 22, 2009. However, if the Company is unable to negotiate a new credit facility or similar access to credit lines, it could adversely affect the Companys ability to operate. At December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. The credit agreement is subject to the usual terms and conditions applied by banks to an investment grade company. The two key covenants of the credit agreement are a net worth test and a debt compared to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) test. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008 and expects to be compliant in future periods. In addition to the credit facility, the Company has $750 million available under a universal shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which a variety of debt and equity instruments could be issued. The Company also has access to the commercial paper market through a $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility, which is rolled over annually. The current facility matures on April 25, 2009. From a credit quality perspective, the Company has an investment grade credit rating of BBB from Standard Poors and Baa3 from Moodys. The current outlook from Standard Poors is negative and we are under review for a potential further downgrade from Moodys. None of the Companys debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in credit ratings.

We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities and the shelf registration will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction, dividends and share repurchase. Financing Activities: Net debt increases were $107.5 million in 2008 excluding the impact of currency translation. Net debt reductions were $101.7 million in 2007 excluding the impact of currency translation. Proceeds from stock options exercised, net of tax benefit were $17.1 million, $46.3 million and $27.1 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company paid dividends to BorgWarner stockholders of $51.1 million, $39.4 million and $36.7 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company had treasury stock purchases of $55.9 million and $47.0 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2008, the accounts receivable securitization facility was sized at $50 million and has been in place with its current funding partner since January 1994. This facility sells accounts receivable without recourse. The Company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases. Types of operating leases include leases on the headquarters facility, an airplane, vehicles, and certain office equipment. The Company also has a lease obligation for production equipment at one of its facilities. The total expected future cash outlays for all lease obligations at the end of 2008 is $65.9 million. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on operating leases, including future minimum payments. The Company has guaranteed the residual values of certain leased machinery and equipment at one of its facilities. The guarantees extend through the maturity of the underlying lease, which is in September 2010. In the event the Company exercises its option not to purchase the machinery and equipment, the Company has guaranteed a residual value of $7.7 million. The Company has accrued $4.1 million as a loss on this guarantee, which is expected to be paid in 2009. 33 Table of Contents Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits The Companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when management deems it appropriate. At December 31, 2008, all legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed $13.3 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2008 and $12.4 million in 2007. The Company expects to contribute a total of $10 million to $20 million in 2009. The funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $(253.5) million and $(136.5) million at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these amounts, $(110.9) million and $(111.1) at the end of 2008 and 2007, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans, hence, the common practice is that they are unfunded plans. Other post employment benefits primarily consist of post employment health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Companys U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other post employment benefits had an unfunded status of $(328.5) million at the end of 2008 and $(373.1) million at the end of 2007. The unfunded levels decreased due to an increase in the discount rate assumption and changes in certain plan designs. The Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. OTHER MATTERS Contingencies In the normal course of business the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. See Notes 8 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Companys management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Litigation Outcome In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc (DTP), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America (UAW) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Courts affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTPs reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW, which does not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008 the Company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result of the Courts decision. The Company has communicated its plan to reduce the level of benefits provided to the retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans. The change will be effective following expiration of the health insurance agreement in April 24, 2009. 34 Table of Contents Environmental The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean up and other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for clean up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula. The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter. Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company has established an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at December 31, 2008 of $11.9 million. The Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed $3.4 million related to any individual site and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years. In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company, relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre date the Companys 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During 2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant. The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage. In 2005, the Company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99% of the then known personal injury and property damage claims relating to the alleged environmental contamination. Those settlements involved payments by the Company of $28.5 million in the second half of 2005 and $15.7 million in the first quarter of 2006, in exchange for, among other things, dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits. In December 2007, a lawsuit was filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately 209 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination. In August 2008, two similar lawsuits were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately 100 plaintiffs and 30 plaintiffs, respectively, alleging personal injury related to the alleged environmental contamination. Given the early stage of the litigation, the Company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome, but its current intent is to vigorously defend against the suits. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47), which requires the Company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is 35 Table of Contents conditional on future renovations (even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks (USTs) and above ground storage tanks (ASTs) when their use ceases, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) transformers and capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners, and lead based paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently has 32 manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2007. Product Liability Like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury actions. We believe that the Companys involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had approximately 27,000 and 42,000 pending asbestos related product liability claims, respectively. Of the 27,000 outstanding claims at December 31, 2008, approximately 16,000 are pending in just three jurisdictions, where significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway. The Companys policy is to aggressively defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2008, of the approximately 17,500 claims resolved, only 210 (1.2%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In 2007, of the approximately 4,400 claims resolved, only 194 (4.4%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were covered by the Companys primary layer insurance coverage, and these carriers administered, defended, settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. This led the Company to access the next available layer of insurance coverage. Since June 2004, secondary layer insurers have paid asbestos related litigation defense and settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement. To date, the Company has paid $50.1 million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received $14.2 million in cash from insurers. The outstanding balance of $35.9 million is expected to be fully recovered. Timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to below. At December 31, 2007, insurers owed $20.6 million in association with these claims. At December 31, 2008, the Company has an estimated liability of $34.7 million for future claims resolutions, with a related asset of $34.7 million to recognize the insurance proceeds receivable by the Company for estimated losses related to claims that have yet to be resolved. Insurance carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected based on the Companys experience, its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to below. At December 31, 2007, the comparable value of the insurance receivable and accrued liability was $39.6 million. 36 Table of Contents The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows: millions of dollars 2008 2007 Assets: Prepayments and other current assets $ 22.1 $ 20.1 Other non current assets 12.6 19.5 Total insurance receivable $ 34.7 $ 39.6 Liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 22.1 $ 20.1 Other non current liabilities 12.6 19.5 Total accrued liability $ 34.7 $ 39.6 The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any, in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify) in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the State or Federal levels. A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies (CNA) against the Company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers. CNA provided the Company with both primary and additional layer insurance, and, in conjunction with other insurers, is currently defending and indemnifying the Company in its pending asbestos related product liability claims. The lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage available to the Company including whether the available limits exhaust on a per occurrence or an aggregate basis, and to determine how the applicable coverage responsibilities should be apportioned. On August 15, 2005, the Court issued an interim order regarding the apportionment matter. The interim order has the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and settlement costs pro rata to time on the risk, with the pro ration method to hold the insured harmless for periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage. Appeals of the interim order were denied. However, the issue is reserved for appellate review at the end of the action. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos related claims, the Company has substantial additional layers of insurance available for potential future asbestos related product claims. As such, the Company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the State or Federal levels, due to the encapsulated nature of the products, the Companys experiences in aggressively defending and resolving claims in the past, and the Companys significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does not believe that asbestos related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. These policies require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed below. 37 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into long term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the price is not fixed over the life of the agreements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. This review is performed using estimates of future cash flows. If the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the evaluations. Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; and (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset. The Company recognized $72.9 million and $56.4 million in impairment of long lived assets as part of restructuring expenses in 2008 and 2006, respectively. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Companys 2006 and 2008 impairment of long lived assets. Goodwill The Company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units, or when events and circumstances warrant such a review. This review utilizes the two step impairment test required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, and requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time, which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to an even higher degree of uncertainty. We also utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable. However, different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. The goodwill impairment test was performed in December and September 2008, December 2007 and December 2006. The Company recognized goodwill impairment of $156.8 million in the Engine segment in 2008 and $0.2 million in the Drivetrain segment in 2006. No goodwill impairment was recorded in 2007. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill. Environmental Accrual We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. Managements estimate of the loss range for environmental liability, including conditional asset retirement obligations, for 2008 is between $12.4 million and $26.1 million. We record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. At the end of 2008, our total accrued environmental liability was $13.3 million, which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under FIN 47 of $1.4 million. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental accrual. 38 Table of Contents Product Warranty The Company provides warranties on some of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claim settlements; as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. The accrual is represented in both current and non current liabilities on the balance sheet. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding product warranty. Other Loss Accruals and Valuation Allowances The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers compensation claims, litigation, and recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. We estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances. Pension and Other Post Employment Defined Benefits The Company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents. The Companys employee defined benefit pension and post employment health care expenses are dependent on managements assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, long term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. The inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. The effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods in accordance with GAAP. The Companys approach to establishing the discount rate is based upon the market yields of high quality corporate bonds, with appropriate consideration of each plans defined benefit payment terms and duration of the liabilities. The discount rate assumption is typically rounded up or down to the nearest 25 basis points for each plan. As a sensitivity measure for the Companys pension plans, a decrease of 25 basis points to the discount rate would increase the Companys 2009 expense by approximately $0.9 million. As for the Companys other post employment benefit plans, a decrease of 25 basis points to the discount rate would increase the Companys 2009 expense by approximately $0.3 million. The Company determines its expected return on plan asset assumptions by evaluating estimates of future market returns and the plans asset allocation. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans invested assets. The Companys expected return on assets assumption reflects the asset allocation of each plan. For 2009, the Company is changing its expected return on U.S. plan assets to 7.50% from 8.75% to reflect adjustments made to its targeted asset allocations. For sensitivity purposes, a 25 basis point decrease in the long term return on assets would increase the 2009 pension expense by approximately $0.8 million. The Company determines its health care inflation rate for its other post employment benefit plans by evaluating the circumstances surrounding the plan design, recent experience and health care economics. For sensitivity purposes, a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend would increase the 39 Table of Contents Companys projected benefit obligation by $18.9 million at December 31, 2008, and would increase the 2009 expense by $1.4 million. Based on the information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources, the Company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions, or experience different from that assumed, could impact the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents foreign operating and other loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain. Management judgment is required in determining the Companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the Companys net deferred tax assets. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Companys valuation allowance may be necessary. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous non U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. The Company is regularly under audit by the various applicable tax authorities. Accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of FASB interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. The Companys federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non U.S. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At December 31, 2008, the Company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the probable loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other non current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). The interpretation prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute, as well as clear criteria for subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and measuring such tax positions for financial statement purposes. FIN 48 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recognized a $16.6 million reduction to its January 1, 2007 retained earnings balance. 40 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157). FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On January 1, 2008, the Company partially adopted as required, FAS 157. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the implementation of FAS 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (FAS 159). FAS 159 allows entities to irrevocably elect to recognize most financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. The stated objective of FAS 159 is to improve financial reporting by giving entities the opportunity to elect to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in order to mitigate earnings volatility caused when related assets and liabilities are measured differently. FAS 159 is effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending March 31, 2008. The Company chose to not make the election to adopt. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)). FAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for recognizing identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, goodwill acquired in the combination or the gain from a bargain purchase, and disclosure requirements. Under this revised statement, all costs incurred to effect an acquisition will be recognized separately from the acquisition. Also, restructuring costs that are expected but the acquirer is not obligated to incur will be recognized separately from the acquisition. FAS 141(R) is effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending March 31, 2009. The adoption of FAS 141(R) is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (FAS 160). FAS 160 requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are clearly identified. In addition, it requires that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the income statement. FAS 160 is effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending March 31, 2009. The adoption of FAS 160 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 2 (FSP FAS 157 2). FSP FAS 157 2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Refer to Note 10, Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Companys partial adoption of FSP FAS 157 2. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 161). FAS 161 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. FAS 161 is effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending March 31, 2009. The adoption of FAS 161 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FAS 132(R) 1). FAS 132(R) 1 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. FAS 132(R) 1 is effective for the Company beginning with its year ending December 31, 2009. The Company is currently assessing the potential impacts, if any, on its consolidated financial statements. 41 Table of Contents In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 140 4 and Financial Interpretation 46(R) 8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities (FSP 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8). FSP 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how an entity accounts for transfers of financial assets, the nature of involvement, if any, after the financial asset sale and the nature of any restrictions on assets reported by an entity in its statement of financial position that relates to a transferred financial asset, including the carrying amounts of such assets. The Company has adjusted its disclosures to be compliant with FSP 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 at December 31,2008. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks. We have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At the end of 2008, the amount of net debt with fixed interest rates was 38.5% of total debt, including the impact of the interest rate swaps. Our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates. A 10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense for 2008 of approximately $2.1 million, and $1.8 million in 2007. We also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10% change in interest rates as of December 31, 2008, the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $24 million if interest rates decreased and would decrease by approximately $22 million if interest rates increased. Our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves. The model, therefore, does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2007, measured in a similar manner, was slightly less than at December 31, 2008. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the British Pound, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the Japanese Yen, and the South Korean Won. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps. Such non U.S. Dollar debt was $495.8 million as of December 31, 2008 and $413.5 million as of December 31, 2007. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing 42 Table of Contents economic and political environments. In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $10.2 million and $(61.8) million, respectively, of which $9.9 million in gains and $(36.3) million in losses mature in less than one year. As of December 31, 2008, $1.0 million in gains and $(8.2) million in losses did not qualify for deferral. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. Commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of $50.2 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was holding commodity derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $2.1 million and $(16.3) million, respectively, of which $1.0 million in gains and $(15.1) million in losses mature in less than one year.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The internal control process includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
