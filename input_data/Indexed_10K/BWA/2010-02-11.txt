Continued benefits from our cost reduction programs, including containment of raw material and energy cost increases, and health care cost inflation in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Restructuring expenses in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 and second quarter of 2009 to adjust headcount and capacity levels, in North America, Europe and Asia. $27.9 million net pre tax gain in 2009 related to retiree obligations resulting from the closure of the Muncie, Indiana, Drivetrain facility. $4.8 million charge in 2009 upon the adoption of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (formerly referred to as FAS 141(R)). $3.0 million net loss in 2009 from interest rate derivative agreements. Adjustments to tax accounts in 2009, 2008 and 2007 upon conclusion of certain tax audits and changes in circumstances, including changes in tax laws. The establishment of a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards in 2009 and 2008 of $7.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively. An 111.5 million $(156.8 million) impairment charge in 2008 to adjust BERUs goodwill to its estimated fair value. An approximate $23.5 million warranty related charge in 2008 associated with a companys transmission product sold in Europe, limited to mid 2007 through May 2008 production. The write offs of the excess purchase price allocated to in process research and development (IPRD), order backlog and beginning inventory related to the 2007 acquisition of approximately 12.8% of BERU stock and the 2008 completion of a Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement (DPTA) between the Company and BERU. Recognition in 2008 of a $4.0 million charge related to an untimely change in the level of medical benefits provided to DTP. 26 Table of Contents The Companys earnings (loss) per diluted share were $0.23, $(0.31) and $2.45 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non recurring or non comparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Non recurring or non comparable items: Restructuring expense $ (0.29 ) $ (0.72 ) $ Interest rate derivative agreements (0.03 ) Topic 805 adoption (0.03 ) Goodwill impairment charge (1.35 ) Transmission product related warranty charge (0.14 ) Tax valuation allowance (0.12 ) Write off of the excess purchase price allocated to IPRD, order backlog and beginning inventory associated with acquisitions (0.04 ) (0.02 ) Retiree healthcare litigation outcome (0.03 ) Change in retiree obligation related to Muncie closure 0.15 Adjustments to tax accounts 0.03 0.02 0.03 Total impact to earnings per share diluted: $ (0.17 ) $ (2.38 ) $ 0.01 The companys effective tax rate, after giving tax effect to the non recurring or non comparable items shown above, was (12.0%), 23.0%, and 27.1% for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Net Sales The table below summarizes the overall worldwide global light vehicle production percentage changes for 2009 and 2008: Worldwide Light Vehicle Year Over Year Increase (Decrease) in Production 2009 2008 North America* (32.4 )% (15.8 )% Europe* (20.5 )% (4.5 )% Asia* (2.1 )% 2.4 % Total Worldwide* (13.7 )% (3.7 )% BorgWarner year over year net sales change (24.7 )% (1.2 )% BorgWarner year over year net sales change excluding currency (21.5 )% (4.8 )% * Data provided by CSM Worldwide. Our net sales decrease in 2009 of 24.7% was worse than the estimated worldwide market production decrease of 13.7%. This is due to the Companys relative higher percentage of business in Europe and North America versus Asia; and certain product mix changes due to scrappage incentives. Our net sales decrease in 2008 of 1.2% was slightly better than the estimated worldwide market production decrease of 3.7%. The effect of changing currency rates had a negative impact on the Companys net sales and net earnings in 2009, but had a positive impact on the Companys net sales and net earnings in 2008. The effect of non U.S. currencies, primarily the Euro, decreased net sales by approximately $169 million and decreased the Companys net earnings by approximately $4 million in 2009. In 2008, non U.S. currencies, primarily the Euro, increased net sales by approximately $191 million and reduced the Companys net loss by approximately $13 million. The year over year decrease in net sales, excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, was 21.5% in 2009. The year over year decrease in net sales, excluding the favorable impact of currency, was 4.8% in 2008. 27 Table of Contents Consolidated net sales to a single customer (including their subsidiaries), which exceeded 10% of our total sales, were to Volkswagen of approximately 22%, 19%, and 15%; and to Ford of approximately 12%, 9%, and 12% for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Both of our reporting segments had significant sales to the customers listed above. Such sales consisted of a variety of products to a variety of customer locations and regions. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented. Outlook The Company is cautiously optimistic about 2010. The Company expects global production volumes to be higher in 2010 compared with 2009. However, visibility is limited in Europe due to uncertainty surrounding consumer demand, the impact of expiring government sponsored incentive programs and other market dynamics. The Company maintains a positive long term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. The trends that are driving our long term growth are expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection diesel and gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of automated transmissions in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in both Europe and Asia Pacific. As the recovery from current global economic conditions occurs, we expect long term sales and net earnings growth to resume to historical rates. Results By Reporting Segment The Companys business is comprised of two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These reporting segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems. The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after tax return on invested capital (ROIC) of its business initiatives. The ROIC is comprised of projected earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest (EBIT) adjusted for taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. EBIT is considered a non GAAP financial measure. Generally, a non GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. EBIT is defined as earnings before restructuring expense, goodwill impairment charge, interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest. Earnings is intended to mean net earnings as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under GAAP. The Company believes that EBIT is useful to demonstrate the operational profitability of its segments by excluding restructuring expense, goodwill impairment charge, interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest, which are generally accounted for across the entire Company on a consolidated basis. EBIT is also one of the measures used by the Company to determine resource allocation within the Company. Although the Company believes that EBIT enhances understanding of its business and performance, it should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net earnings or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. 28 Table of Contents The following tables present net sales and Segment EBIT by segment for the years 2009, 2008 and 2007: Net Sales millions of dollars Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Engine $ 2,883.2 $ 3,861.5 $ 3,761.3 Drivetrain 1,093.5 1,426.4 1,598.8 Inter segment eliminations (14.9 ) (24.0 ) (31.5 ) Net sales $ 3,961.8 $ 5,263.9 $ 5,328.6 Earnings (Loss) Before Interest and Taxes millions of dollars Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Engine $ 219.8 $ 394.9 $ 418.0 Drivetrain (13.5 ) (4.9 ) 118.1 Segment earnings before interest and taxes (Segment EBIT) 206.3 390.0 536.1 Muncie closure retiree obligation net gain 27.9 Corporate, including equity in affiliates earnings and stock based compensation (111.3 ) (60.0 ) (77.7 ) Consolidated earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) 122.9 330.0 458.4 Restructuring expense 50.3 127.5 Goodwill impairment charge 156.8 Interest income (2.5 ) (7.1 ) (6.7 ) Interest expense and finance charges 57.2 38.8 34.7 Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest 17.9 14.0 430.4 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (18.5 ) 33.3 113.9 Net earnings (loss) 36.4 (19.3 ) 316.5 Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax 9.4 16.3 28.0 Net earnings (loss) attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $ 27.0 $ (35.6 ) $ 288.5 The Engine segment 2009 net sales were down 25.3% from 2008, with a 44.3% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period. The Engine segment decrease was primarily driven by reduced global vehicle production and depressed demand for engine products. The Segment EBIT margin was 7.6% in 2009, down from 10.2% in 2008, due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the U.S. and European markets. The Engine segment 2008 net sales were up 2.7% from 2007, with a 5.5% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period. The Engine segment continued to benefit from Asian automaker demand for turbochargers and timing systems, European automaker demand for turbochargers, timing systems, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves and diesel engine ignition systems. This benefit was offset by lower North American production of light truck and sport utility vehicles. The Segment EBIT margin was 10.2% in 2008, down from 11.1% in 2007 (which includes the one time write off in 2008 of the excess purchase price allocated to BERUs IPRD, order backlog and inventory), due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the U.S. and European markets, and increased costs for raw materials, principally steel. 29 Table of Contents The Drivetrain segment 2009 net sales decreased 23.3% from 2008 with a 175.5% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period. The group was negatively impacted by lower global production of light trucks and SUVs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products. Segment EBIT margin was (1.2)% in 2009, down from (0.3)% in the prior year, primarily due to lower global production of light trucks and sport utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products. The Drivetrain segment 2008 net sales decreased 10.8% from 2007 with a 104.1% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period. The group was negatively impacted by lower U.S. production of light trucks and SUVs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products. Segment EBIT margin was (0.3)% in 2008, down from 7.4% in the prior year, due to the combined effect of DCT product start up cost pressures and lower North American production of light trucks and sport utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products. Corporate is the difference between calculated total consolidated EBIT and the total of the Segments EBIT. It represents corporate headquarters expenses, expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments, expenses associated with divested operations and equity in affiliates earnings. This net expense was $111.3 million in 2009, $60.0 million in 2008 and $77.7 million in 2007. The increase in Corporate expenses in 2009 is primarily related to a decline in affiliate earnings, an increase in pension and other postemployment expenses and an increase in performance related compensation. Other Factors Affecting Results of Operations The following table details our results of operations as a percentage of sales: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 85.8 84.1 82.2 Gross profit 14.2 15.9 17.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.6 10.3 10.0 Restructuring expense 1.3 2.4 Goodwill impairment charge 3.0 Other (income) expense Operating income 1.3 0.2 7.8 Equity in affiliates earnings, net of tax (0.6 ) (0.7 ) (0.8 ) Interest income (0.1 ) (0.2 ) Interest expense and finance charges 1.4 0.7 0.7 Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest 0.5 0.3 8.1 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (0.4 ) 0.7 2.2 Net earnings (loss) 0.9 (0.4 ) 5.9 Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax 0.2 0.3 0.5 Net earnings (loss) attributable to BorgWarner Inc. 0.7 % (0.7 )% 5.4 % Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 14.2%, 15.9% and 17.8% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our gross profit decrease in 2009 was due to sales volumes declining faster than our ability to reduce our cost structure. Cost reduction actions taken in 2009 to reduce our cost structure included headcount reductions, global pay cuts, selected plant shutdowns and reduced work weeks outside of the U.S. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) as a percentage of net sales were 11.6%, 10.3% and 10.0% in 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively. 2009 SGA expenses decreased $83.1 million or 15.3% compared to 2008. The 2009 increase in SGA as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a 30 Table of Contents significant year over year reduction in sales with increased pension and other postemployment expenses and performance related compensation, net of salary wage reductions. Research and development (RD) is a major component of our SGA expenses. RD spending, net of customer reimbursements, was $155.2 million or 3.9% of sales in 2009, compared to $205.7 million, or 3.9% of sales in 2008, and $210.8 million, or 4.0% of sales in 2007. We currently intend to continue to increase our spending in RD, although the growth rate in the future may not necessarily match the rate of our sales growth. We also intend to continue to invest in a number of cross business RD programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short and long term growth. Our current long term expectation for RD spending is approximately 4.0% of sales. We intend to maintain our commitment to RD spending while continuing to focus on controlling other SGA costs. Restructuring expense of $50.3 million in 2009 and $127.5 million in 2008 was in response to declines in global customer production levels, customer restructurings and a subsequent evaluation of our headcount levels in North America, Europe and Asia and our long term capacity needs. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company took additional restructuring actions. The Company reduced its North American workforce by approximately 550 people, or 12%; its European workforce by approximately 150 people, or 2%; and its Asian workforce by approximately 60 people, or 3% in the second quarter. The net restructuring expense recognized in the second quarter was $9.0 million for employee termination benefits. In addition to employee termination costs, the Company recorded $36.3 million of asset impairment and $5.0 million of other charges in the second quarter of 2009 related to the North American and European restructuring. The combined 2009 restructuring expenses of $50.3 million are broken out by segment as follows: Engine $27.2 million, Drivetrain $19.7 million and Corporate $3.4 million. Included in the second quarter of 2009 asset impairment charge is $22.3 million related to one of the Companys European locations. During the second quarter of 2009 circumstances caused the Company to evaluate the long range outlook of the facility using an undiscounted and discounted cash flow model, both of which indicated that assets were impaired. The Company then used a replacement cost technique to determine the fair value of the assets at the facility. This reduction of asset value was included in the Engine segment. On July 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring of its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing, fundamental market shift in the auto industry. As a continuation of the Companys third quarter restructuring, on December 11, 2008, the Company announced plans for additional restructuring actions. As a result of these third and fourth quarter 2008 restructuring actions, the Company had reduced its North American workforce by approximately 2,400 people, or 33%; its European workforce by approximately 1,600 people, or 18%; and its Asian workforce by approximately 400 people, or 17%. The restructuring expense recognized for employee termination benefits was $54.6 million. In addition to employee termination costs, the Company recorded $72.9 million of asset impairment charges related to the North American and European restructuring. The combined restructuring expenses of $127.5 million are broken out by segment as follows: Engine $85.3 million, Drivetrain $40.9 million and Corporate $1.3 million. Refer to Note 17, Restructuring of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Equity in affiliates earnings, net of tax was $21.8 million, $38.4 million and $40.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This line item is primarily driven by the results of our 50% owned Japanese joint venture, NSK Warner, and our 32.6% owned Indian joint venture, Turbo Energy Limited (TEL). The significant reduction to equity in affiliates earnings in 2009 is primarily due to lower vehicle production in Asia. For more discussion of NSK Warner, see Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense and finance charges were $57.2 million, $38.8 million and $34.7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in 2009 expense over 2008 was primarily due to increased debt levels, resulting from the Companys $373.8 million convertible debt offering, which provided the Company increased liquidity. The increase in 2008 expense over 2007 expense was primarily due to costs related to acquiring 100% of BERU. 31 Table of Contents The provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate for 2009 of (103.4%) compared with rates of 237.9% in 2008 and 26.5% in 2007. The effective tax rate of (103.4%) for 2009 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a reduction in U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S.; the realization of certain business tax credits including RD and U.S. based foreign tax credits; and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates earnings. Noncontrolling interest, net of tax of $9.4 million decreased by $6.9 million from 2008 and by $18.6 million from 2007. The decrease is primarily related to the Companys increased ownership to 100% of BERU. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Capitalization millions of dollars 2009 2008 % Change Notes payable $ 69.1 $ 183.8 Current portion of long term debt 136.9 Long term debt 773.2 459.6 Total debt 842.3 780.3 7.9 % Total stockholders equity 2,222.7 2,037.5 9.1 % Total capitalization $ 3,065.0 $ 2,817.8 8.8 % Total debt to capital ratio 27.5% 27.7% The $62.0 million increase in debt was primarily due to the April 9, 2009 issuance of $373.8 million in convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012, offset somewhat by the maturity of our $136.7 million, 6.50% senior notes. Stockholders equity increased by $185.2 million in 2009 as follows: millions of dollars Balance, January 1, 2009 $ 2,037.5 Net earnings 27.0 Currency translation and hedged instruments, net 101.8 Reissuance of treasury stock 29.5 Convertible bond issuance, net of hedge and warrants 29.2 Stock compensation 27.3 Dividends declared (13.8 ) Defined benefit post employment plans (3.4 ) All other, net (12.4 ) Balance, December 31, 2009 $ 2,222.7 The currency translation component of other comprehensive income increased in 2009 primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro, Korean Won and British Pound in relation to the U.S. Dollar. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $351.0 million, $400.8 million and $603.5 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The $49.8 million decrease in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to lower operational earnings, somewhat offset by lower working capital needs. The $202.7 million decrease in 2008 from 2007 was primarily due to lower earnings and increased working capital. The $351.0 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2009 consists of net earnings of $36.4 million, increased for non cash 32 Table of Contents charges of $297.6 million and a $17.0 million increase in net operating assets and liabilities. Non cash charges are primarily comprised of $260.9 million in depreciation and amortization. Inventory decreased in 2009 by $143.0 million excluding the impact of currency due to lower business levels, particularly in North America and Europe. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $154.8 million, $343.9 million and $229.2 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital expenditures, including tooling outlays (capital spending) of $172.0 million in 2009, or 4.3% of sales and decreased $197.7 million over the 2008 level of $369.7 million, or 7.0% of sales. Selective capital spending remains an area of focus for us, both in order to support our book of new business and for cost reduction and other purposes. Heading into 2010, we plan to continue to spend capital to support the launch of our new applications and for cost reductions and productivity improvement projects. Financing Activities and Liquidity Liquidity: The Company had $357.4 million of cash on hand at December 31, 2009. The Company has a multi currency revolving credit facility, which provides for borrowings up to $250 million through January 22, 2011. The facility is secured by unperfected pledges of the Companys equity interests in its subsidiaries and certain assets. No secured party is entitled to perfect its lien on any of the collateral until the long term unsecured senior, non credit enhanced debt rating of the Company is rated less than or equal to BB+ by Standard Poors and less than or equal to Ba1 by Moodys. The three key covenants of the credit agreement are a net worth test, a debt compared to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) test, and an interest coverage test. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009 and expects to be compliant in future periods. At December 31, 2009 and 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. In addition to the credit facility, as of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $376 million available under a universal shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which a variety of debt and equity instruments could be issued. From a credit quality perspective, the Company has a credit rating of BBB from Standard Poors and Ba1 from Moodys. On March 18, 2009, Moodys downgraded the Companys credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1. The current outlook from Standard Poors and Moodys is negative. None of the Companys debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a decrease in credit ratings. On April 24, 2009 the Companys $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was repaid. On December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility. This facility matures on December 21, 2012, subject to extension or replacement of the revolving credit facility by January 2011. Both the maturity and repayment; as well as the subsequent renewal of our accounts receivable securitization facility are reflected as Financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 33 Table of Contents The Companys significant contractual obligation payments at December 31, 2009 are as follows: millions of dollars Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 After 2014 Other post employment benefits excluding pensions(a) $ 597.6 $ 29.4 $ 58.1 $ 54.8 $ 455.3 Defined benefit pension plans(b) 134.6 7.7 44.5 32.0 50.4 Notes payable and long term debt 844.5 69.1 336.8 2.1 436.5 Projected interest payments(c) 373.0 58.4 91.1 73.9 149.6 Non cancelable operating leases(d) 62.0 20.5 21.8 10.5 9.2 Capital spending obligations 28.6 28.6 Inventory purchase obligations 28.1 28.1 Income tax payments(e) 57.5 57.5 Environmental(f) 22.3 13.6 2.6 1.6 4.5 Total $ 2,148.2 $ 312.9 $ 554.9 $ 174.9 $ 1,105.5 (a) Other post employment benefits excluding pensions include anticipated future payments to cover retiree medical and life insurance benefits. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys pension and other post employment benefits. (b) The Company expects to contribute a total of $10 million to $20 million into all defined benefit pension plans during 2010. Since the timing and amount of payments for funded defined benefit pension plans are usually not certain for future years such potential payments are not shown in this table, except for the Companys proposed settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to make payments of $15 million per year in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Amount contained in After 2014 column are for unfunded plans and includes estimated payments through 2019. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys pension and other post employment benefits. (c) Projection is based upon actual fixed rates where appropriate, and a projected floating rate for the variable rate portion of the total debt portfolio. The floating rate projection is based upon current market conditions and rounded to the nearest 50th basis point (0.50%), which is 4.6% for this purpose. Projection is also based upon debt being redeemed upon maturity. (d) 2010 includes $6.0 million for the guaranteed residual value of production equipment with a lease that expires in 2010. Please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details concerning this lease. (e) See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys income taxes. (f) See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys environmental liability. We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities, and the remaining shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation. Financing Activities: Net debt increases, excluding the impact of currency translation, were $102.4 million and $107.5 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively. Net debt decreases were $101.7 million in 2007 excluding the impact of currency translation. Proceeds from stock options exercised, net of tax benefit were $8.7 million, $17.1 million and $46.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company paid dividends to BorgWarner stockholders of $13.8 million, $51.1 million and $39.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company had treasury stock purchases of $55.9 million and $47.0 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. 34 Table of Contents The Company purchased approximately 0.4 million, 1.34 million and 1.28 million BERU shares in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The cost for these shares was $46.6 million, $136.8 million and $138.8 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively and has been reflected as payments for noncontrolling interest acquired in the Financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 18, Recent Transactions for further information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements On April 24, 2009 the Companys $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was repaid. On December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility. This facility matures on December 21, 2012, subject to extension or replacement of the revolving credit facility by January 2011. Both the maturity and repayment; as well as the subsequent renewal of our accounts receivable securitization facility are reflected as Financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company is required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166, Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets an amendment of ASC Topic 860 (FAS 166) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to ASC Topic 810 (FAS 167) on January 1, 2010. This adoption requires the Company to reflect its receivable securitization facility in its financial statements. Accounting rules prior to January 1, 2010 allowed off balance sheet treatment. The first quarter 2010 impact of this adoption is expected to be an increase in receivables of $50 million and an increase in debt of $50 million in the Companys December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases. Types of operating leases include leases on the headquarters facility, an airplane, vehicles, and certain office equipment. The Company also has a lease obligation for production equipment at one of its facilities. The total expected future cash outlays for all lease obligations at the end of 2009 is $62.0 million. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on operating leases, including future minimum payments. The Company has guaranteed the residual values of certain leased machinery and equipment at its facilities. The guarantees extend through the maturity of the underlying lease, which is in September 2010. In the event the Company exercises its option not to purchase the remaining machinery and equipment, the Company has guaranteed a residual value of $6.0 million at September 30, 2010. Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits The Companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. At December 31, 2009, all legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed $39.3 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009 and $13.3 million in 2008. The Company expects to contribute a total of $10 million to $20 million in 2010. The funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $(229.9) million and $(253.5) million at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these amounts, $(131.1) million and $(110.9) at the end of 2009 and 2008, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence the common practice is that they are unfunded plans. Other post employment benefits primarily consist of post employment health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Companys U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other post employment benefits had an unfunded status of $(278.5) million at the end of 2009 and $(328.5) million at the end of 2008. The unfunded levels decreased due to the closure of the Companys Muncie, Indiana automotive components plant and changes in certain plan designs. The Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future. 35 Table of Contents See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. OTHER MATTERS Contingencies In the normal course of business the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. See Notes 7 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Companys management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Litigation Outcome In January 2006, DTP, a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America (UAW) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Courts affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTPs reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008 the Company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result of the Courts decision. DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and others, individually and as representatives of a defendant class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Courts affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor Management Relations Act or the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror image action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan is continuing. At this stage of the litigation, the Company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome, but it is vigorously defending against the suit. Environmental The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean up and other remedial activities at 35 such sites. Responsibility for clean up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula. The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not large or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter. 36 Table of Contents Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at December 31, 2009 of $21.0 million. The Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed $3.0 million related to any individual site except for the Crystal Springs site discussed below, and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years. In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company, relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre date the Companys 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During 2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant. The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged environmental contamination. In 2005, the Company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99% of those claims and the remainder of them have since been dismissed. In 2007 and 2008, four additional lawsuits were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately 340 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination. At this stage of the litigation, the Company cannot make any predictions as to the outcome, but it is vigorously defending against the suits. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations In March 2005, the FASB issued ASC Topic 410, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires the Company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is conditional on future renovations (even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use ceases, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers and capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners, and lead based paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently has 31 manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at $1.3 million as of December 31, 2009 and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2008. Product Liability Like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury actions. We believe that the Companys involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 the Company had approximately 23,000 and 27,000 pending asbestos related product liability claims, respectively. Of the 23,000 outstanding claims at December 31, 2009, approximately 12,000 were pending in just three jurisdictions, where significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway. 37 Table of Contents The Companys policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2009, of the approximately 5,300 claims resolved, only 223 (4.2%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In 2008, of the approximately 17,500 claims resolved, only 210 (1.2%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were covered by the Companys primary layer insurance coverage, and these carriers administered, defended, settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. This led the Company to access the next available layer of insurance coverage. Since June 2004, secondary layer insurers have paid asbestos related litigation defense and settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement. To date, the Company has paid $79.8 million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received $21.2 million in cash from insurers. The net outstanding balance of $58.6 million is expected to be fully recovered, of which $23.0 million is expected to be recovered in 2010. Timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to below. At December 31, 2008, insurers owed $35.9 million in association with these claims. In addition, at December 31, 2009, the Company has estimated a liability of $49.9 million for claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs. The Company also has a related asset of $49.9 million to recognize the proceeds receivable from the insurance carriers. Insurance carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected based on the Companys experience, its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to below. At December 31, 2008, the comparable value of the insurance receivable and accrued liability was $34.7 million. The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows: millions of dollars 2009 2008 Assets: Prepayments and other current assets $ 24.9 $ 22.1 Other non current assets 25.0 12.6 Total insurance receivable $ 49.9 $ 34.7 Liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 24.9 $ 22.1 Other non current liabilities 25.0 12.6 Total accrued liability $ 49.9 $ 34.7 The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any, in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify) in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the State or Federal levels. A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies (CNA) against the Company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers. CNA provided the Company with both primary and additional layer insurance, and, in conjunction with other insurers, is currently defending and indemnifying the Company in its pending asbestos related product liability claims. The lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage available to the Company including whether the available limits exhaust on a per occurrence or an aggregate basis, and to determine how the applicable coverage responsibilities should be apportioned. On August 15, 2005, the Court issued an interim order regarding the apportionment matter. The interim order has 38 Table of Contents the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and settlement costs pro rata to time on the risk, with the pro ration method to hold the insured harmless for periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage. Appeals of the interim order were denied. However, the issue is reserved for appellate review at the end of the action. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos related claims, the Company has substantial additional layers of insurance available for potential future asbestos related product claims. As such, the Company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the State or Federal levels, due to the encapsulated nature of the products, the Companys experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past, and the Companys significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does not believe that asbestos related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. These policies require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed below. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into long term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the price is not fixed over the life of the agreements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. Such events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in market volumes, or project life, or a loss of a major customer application (i.e., a triggering event). The Companys impairment review is performed at each manufacturing, assembly, and technical site by local and business unit management, using data that is the basis for the Companys annual budget (or forecast on an interim basis) and long range plan (LRP). The annual budget and LRP include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments. If the operating site review reflects that a triggering event has occurred, the assets identified by the operating location as potentially impaired will be reviewed by management. The review will determine if a current or future alternative use exists for additional customer applications or if redeployment of the assets to any of the Companys other operating sites around the world is justified. If a future alternative use can not be identified, a test for recoverability is performed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. The test compares projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of a product line or a specific customer application or asset grouping, as applicable. If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a test based on the discounted future cash flows. (The discount rate used for impairment testing is the same for both long lived assets and goodwill). If the carrying value of the long lived assets is considered impaired based on the discounted future cash flow analysis, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds their fair value. In certain cases, management will consider estimates obtained from third parties as evidence of the assets fair value, including among other factors, the assets orderly liquidation value. Management believes that the 39 Table of Contents estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable. However, changes in assumptions with respect to future volumes, program project life or future asset use, in addition to future cash flows underlying these estimates could affect the Companys fair value evaluations. Due to the sudden decline in the global automotive markets in 2008 and 2009, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its long lived assets. As a result of these reviews, the Company recognized $36.3 million and $72.9 million in impairment of long lived assets (i.e., plant and equipment) as part of restructuring expenses in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 and 2008 impairment charges are broken out by segment as follows: millions of dollars 2009 2008 Drivetrain Group $ 13.7 $ 22.1 Engine Group 22.6 50.8 Total $ 36.3 $ 72.9 Further declines in the industry could result in additional impairment charges on the Companys remaining property, plant and equipment balance of $1,490.3 million and amortized intangible assets balance of $111.2 million at December 31, 2009. See Note 17, Restructuring and Note 9 Fair Value Measurements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Companys 2009 and 2008 impairment of long lived assets and a discussion of market based measurements. Goodwill The Company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units, or more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The Companys goodwill impairment review utilizes the two step impairment test required under ASC Topic 350, which requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of our goodwill impairment analysis is the Companys annual budget and long range plan (LRP). The annual budget and LRP include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments. As part of the projection, we assumed the last year of the LRP data is a fair indication, on average, including fundamental industry growth, of the future performance of the business beyond the five year period into perpetuity. As the LRP is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We also utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our business units are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the Companys December 31, 2009 goodwill impairment review are as follows: Discount Rate: The Company used a 10% weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent an estimate of the Companys weighted average cost of debt and equity. We believe this 10% discount rate is representative of a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant. Operating Income Margin: The Company utilized historical and expected operating income margins, which varied based on the projections of each business unit being evaluated. While the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Companys analysis. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to an 40 Table of Contents increase in our discount rate and decrease in our operating income margin assumptions; as it would have reduced the Companys goodwill of $1,061.4 million as of December 31, 2009: 2009 millions of dollars Impairment Impact 1 percentage point increase in discount rate $ 109.9 1 percentage point decrease in operating income margin $ 93.1 See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill. Environmental Accrual We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. Managements estimate of the loss range for environmental liability, including conditional asset retirement obligations, for 2009 is between approximately $20 million and $40 million. We record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. At the end of 2009, our total accrued environmental liability was $22.3 million, which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410 of $1.3 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental accrual. Product Warranty The Company provides warranties on some of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claim settlements; as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. Our warranty provision over the last three years, and as a percentage of net sales, has trended as follows: millions of dollars 2009 2008 2007 Net Sales $ 3,961.8 $ 5,263.9 $ 5,328.6 Warranty Provision $ 46.0 $ 66.1 $ 60.7 Warranty Provision as a Percentage of Net Sales 1.2% 1.3% 1.1% The following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change (as a percentage of sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the Companys accrued warranty liability: (Income)/Expense millions of dollars 2009 2008 2007 25 basis point decrease $ (9.9 ) $ (13.2 ) $ (13.3 ) 25 basis point increase $ 9.9 $ 13.2 $ 13.3 At the end of 2009, our total accrued warranty liability was $61.7 million. The accrual is represented as $32.5 million in current liabilities and $29.2 million in non current liabilities on our balance sheet. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding product warranty. Other Loss Accruals and Valuation Allowances The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers compensation claims, litigation, and recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. We 41 Table of Contents estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances. Pension and Other Post Employment Defined Benefits The Company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents. Using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions, the Companys defined benefit pension and non pension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 712. The determination of the Companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain of the more important assumptions are described in Note 11 Retirement Benefit Plans to the Companys consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and include the discount rate, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the Companys accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics 712 and 715 as of December 31, 2009 are as follows: Long term rate of return on plan assets: The expected long term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic pension cost. The required use of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long term returns. The expected long term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs. These inputs include historical returns for the different asset classes held by the Companys trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans invested assets. In determining its pension expense for 2009, the Company used long term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 2.25% to 9.50% outside of the U.S. and 7.50% in the U.S. Actual return on U.S. pension assets for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 25.3%, (25.7%) and 3.9%, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% in 2009 and 8.75% for 2008 and 2007. Actual return on U.K. pension assets for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were 15.1%, (18.7%) and 6.4%, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% in 2009 and 7.25% for 2008 and 2007. Discount rate: The discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations (OPEB). The discount rate assumption is based on a constant effective yield from matching projected plan cash flows to high quality (Aa) bond yields of corresponding maturities as of the measurement date. The Company used discount rates ranging from 2.0% to 9.0% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of December 31, 2009, including weighted average discount rates of 5.75% for U.S. pension plans, 5.43% for non U.S. pension plans, and 5.50% for U.S. other post employment health care plans. The U.S. discount rate reflects the fact that our U.S. pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 (1999 for our U.S. health care plan), and with the closing of our Muncie facility in 2009, there will be negligible service cost going forward. 42 Table of Contents Health care cost trend: For postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. In determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of December 31, 2009, the Company used health care cost trend rates of 7.70%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5% by the year 2019. While the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for Company sponsored U.S. and non U.S. pension plans on its 2010 pre tax pension expense: Impact on Impact on U.S. 2010 Non U.S. 2010 Pre Tax Pension Pre Tax Pension millions of dollars (Expense)/Income (Expense)/Income 1 percentage point decrease in discount rate * $ (3.3 ) 1 percentage point increase in discount rate * $ 3.3 1 percentage point decrease in expected return on assets $ (2.6 ) $ (1.4 ) 1 percentage point increase in expected return on assets $ 2.6 $ 1.4 * Impact of 1 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate will have a negligible impact on the Companys 2010 pre tax pension expense. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Companys U.S. OPEB interest expense: Impact on 2010 Pre Tax OPEB Interest millions of dollars (Expense)/Income 1 percentage point decrease in discount rate $ (1.6 ) 1 percentage point increase in discount rate $ 1.6 The sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Companys total 2010 U.S. OPEB expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the Companys OPEB obligation and service and interest cost: One Percentage Point millions of dollars Increase Decrease Effect on other post employment benefit obligation $ 18.8 $ (16.7 ) Effect on total service and interest cost components $ 1.1 $ (1.0 ) See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Companys retirement benefit plans. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance that primarily represents foreign net operating losses and U.S. based foreign tax credits for which utilization is uncertain. Management judgment 43 Table of Contents is required in determining the Companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the Companys net deferred tax assets. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Companys valuation allowance may be necessary. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 605. The Companys U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non U.S. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At December 31, 2009, the Company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other non current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, FASB ASC amended Topic 740, Income Taxes. The interpretation prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute, as well as clear criteria for subsequently recognizing, derecognizing and measuring such tax positions for financial statement purposes. ASC Topic 740 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 740 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of ASC Topic 740, the Company recognized a $16.6 million reduction to its January 1, 2007 retained earnings balance. In September 2006, the FASB ASC amended Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On January 1, 2009, the Company fully adopted as required, ASC Topic 820. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the implementation of ASC Topic 820. In February 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 825, Financial Instruments. ASC Topic 825 allows entities to irrevocably elect to recognize most financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. The stated objective of ASC Topic 825 is to improve financial reporting by giving entities the opportunity to elect to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in order to mitigate earnings volatility caused when related assets and liabilities are measured differently. ASC Topic 825 was effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending March 31, 2008. The Company chose to not make the election to adopt. In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 805, Business Combinations. ASC Topic 805 establishes principles and requirements for recognizing identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, goodwill acquired in the combination or the gain from a bargain purchase, and disclosure requirements. Under this revised statement, all costs incurred to effect an acquisition are recognized separately from the acquisition. Also, restructuring costs that are expected but the acquirer is not obligated to incur are recognized separately from the acquisition. On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 805. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company expensed $4.8 million related to on going acquisition related activity. 44 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 810, Consolidation. For consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned, the third party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The portion of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income (loss) applicable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of operation, and the portion of stockholders equity of such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 810. The adoption of ASC Topic 810 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, it did impact the presentation and disclosure of noncontrolling (minority) interests in our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the retrospective presentation and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 810, the Company was required to reflect the change in presentation and disclosure for the period ending March 31, 2009 and all periods presented in future filings. The principal effect on the prior year balance sheets related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions) Balance Sheet December 31, 2008 Total stockholders equity, as previously reported $ 2,006.0 Increase for Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest 31.5 Total stockholders equity, as adjusted $ 2,037.5 The principal effect on the prior year statement of operations related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions) Year Ended Year Ended Consolidated Statement of Operations December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Net earnings (loss), as previously reported $ (35.6 ) $ 288.5 Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest (16.3 ) (28.0 ) Net earnings (loss), as adjusted $ (19.3 ) $ 316.5 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest (16.3 ) (28.0 ) Net earnings (loss) attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $ (35.6 ) $ 288.5 The principal effect on the prior year statement of cash flows related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions) Year Ended Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Net earnings (loss), as previously reported $ (35.6 ) $ 288.5 Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest (16.3 ) (28.0 ) Net earnings (loss), as adjusted $ (19.3 ) $ 316.5 (millions) Year Ended Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Equity in affiliates earnings, net of dividends received, minority interest and other, as previously reported $ 28.3 $ 16.0 Less: Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest (16.3 ) (28.0 ) Equity in affiliates earnings, net of dividends received and other $ 12.0 $ (12.0 ) 45 Table of Contents The principal effect on the prior year comprehensive income related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions) Year Ended Year Ended Comprehensive Income (Loss) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Net foreign currency translation and hedge instruments adjustment, as previously reported $ (136.9 ) $ 116.9 Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest (10.8 ) (6.8 ) Net foreign currency translation and hedge instruments adjustment, as adjusted $ (126.1 ) $ 123.7 Due to the adoption of ASC Topic 810, the Company revised the presentation of cash payments related to the acquisition of noncontrolling (minority) interests from the Investing to the Financing section of the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The principal effect on the prior year cash flows related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions) Year Ended Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Payments for businesses acquired, net of cash acquired, as previously reported $ (141.2 ) $ (138.8 ) Less: Topic 805 reclass of noncontrolling interest 141.2 138.8 Payments for businesses acquired, net of cash acquired $ $ (millions) Year Ended Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Net cash used in investing activities, as previously reported $ (485.1 ) $ (368.0 ) Less: Topic 805 reclass of noncontrolling interest 141.2 138.8 Net cash used in investing activities $ (343.9 ) $ (229.2 ) (millions) Year Ended Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities, as previously reported $ 5.1 $ (159.3 ) Less: Topic 805 reclass of noncontrolling interest (141.2 ) (138.8 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (136.1 ) $ (298.1 ) In March 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. ASC Topic 815 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under ASC Topic 815 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 815. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the implementation of ASC Topic 815. In May 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 470, Debt. Under ASC Topic 470, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuers interest cost. ASC Topic 470 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with retrospective application required. As a result of our adoption of ASC Topic 470 for fiscal 2009 and the Companys April 9, 2009 issuance of $373.8 million convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012, we recorded the equity and liability components of the notes on our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, ASC Topic 470 requires us to accrete the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to 46 Table of Contents their face value over the term of the notes. The Companys interest expense associated with this amortization is based on the effective interest rate of the convertible senior notes of 9.365%. The total interest expense related to the convertible notes in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $22.2 million. The non cash portion of interest expense for the convertible notes for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $12.7 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding this issuance. In December 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits. ASC Topic 715 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. See Note 9 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the implementation of ASC Topic 715 on December 31, 2009. In May 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 855, Subsequent Events. ASC Topic 855 requires entities to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated, as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued. The Company adopted ASC Topic 855 in the second quarter of 2009 and has evaluated all subsequent events through February 11, 2010 (the date the Companys financial statements are issued). In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166, Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets an amendment of ASC Topic 860 (FAS 166). FAS 166 removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity from ASC Topic 860 and removes the exception from applying ASC Topic 810, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to qualifying special purpose entities. This Statement modifies the financial components approach used in ASC Topic 860 and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized. Additionally, enhanced disclosures are required to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferors continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. FAS 166 is effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending March 31, 2010. The first quarter 2010 impact of this adoption is expected to be an increase in receivables of $50 million and an increase in debt of $50 million in the Companys December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to ASC Topic 810 (FAS 167). FAS 167 amends ASC Topic 810 to require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Additionally, FAS 167 requires enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. FAS 167 is effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending March 31, 2010. The adoption of FAS 167 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This ASC Topic instituted a major change in the way accounting standards are organized. The accounting standards Codification became the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP. As of September 30, 2009 only one level of authoritative GAAP exists, other than guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. All other literature is non authoritative. The Company adopted the Codification in the third quarter of 2009. The adoption of the Codification had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. This adoption required all issued authoritative literature to be disclosed using Codification Sections. Authoritative literature has been referenced within our 2009 report on Form 10 K under these new Codification Sections. New standards not yet codified have been referenced as issued and will be updated when codified. 47 Table of Contents QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks. We have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At the end of 2009, the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 62.0% of total debt, including the impact of the interest rate swaps. Our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates. A 10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately $1.5 million in 2009, and $2.1 million in 2008. We also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10% change in interest rates as of December 31, 2009, the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $22.0 million if interest rates decreased and would decrease by approximately $20.0 million if interest rates increased. Our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves. The model, therefore, does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2008, measured in a similar manner, was slightly more than at December 31, 2009. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the British Pound, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the Japanese Yen, and the South Korean Won. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps. Such non U.S. Dollar debt was $303.1 million as of December 31, 2009 and $495.8 million as of December 31, 2008. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $3.8 million and $(17.5) million, respectively, of which $3.6 million in gains and $(14.5) million in losses mature in less than one year. As of December 31, 2009, $0.5 million in gains and $(2.3) million in losses did not qualify for deferral. 48 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. Commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of $14.8 million. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was holding commodity derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $8.4 million and $(0.1) million, respectively, all of which mature in less than one year. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain forward looking statements as contemplated by the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that are based on managements current expectations, estimates and projections. Words such as outlook, expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates, or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of the Company, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed, projected or implied in or by the forward looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include: fluctuations in domestic or foreign automotive production, the continued use of outside suppliers, fluctuations in demand for vehicles containing BorgWarner products, general economic conditions, as well as other risks detailed in the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the factors identified under Item 1A, Risk Factors, in its most recently filed annual report on Form 10 K. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement. 49 Table of Contents REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The information in this report is the responsibility of management. BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company) has in place reporting guidelines and policies designed to ensure that the statements and other information contained in this report present a fair and accurate financial picture of the Company. In fulfilling this management responsibility, we make informed judgments and estimates conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The internal control process includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment and those criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2009, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Companys consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 as stated in their report. The Companys Audit Committee, composed entirely of directors of the Company who are not employees, meets periodically with the Companys management and independent registered public accounting firm to review financial results and procedures, internal financial controls and internal and external audit plans and recommendations. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Audit Committee and the independent registered public accounting firm have unrestricted access to each other with or without the presence of management representatives. /s/ Timothy M.
