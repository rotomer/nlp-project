The Company believes the following table is useful in highlighting non recurring or non comparable items that impacted its earnings per diluted share: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Non recurring or non comparable items: Environmental litigation settlement $ (0.14 ) $ $ Medicare Part D tax law change (0.02 ) Reversal of foreign tax credit valuation allowance 0.17 BERU Eichenauer equity investment gain 0.04 Restructuring expense (0.29 ) (0.72 ) Interest rate derivative agreements (0.03 ) Topic 805 adoption (0.03 ) Goodwill impairment charge (1.35 ) Transmission product related warranty charge (0.14 ) Tax valuation allowance (0.12 ) Write off of the excess purchase price allocated to IPRD, order backlog and beginning inventory associated with acquisitions (0.04 ) Retiree healthcare litigation outcome (0.03 ) Change in retiree obligation related to Muncie closure 0.15 Adjustments to tax accounts 0.03 0.02 Total impact to earnings per share diluted: $ 0.05 $ (0.17 ) $ (2.38 ) The Companys effective tax rate, after giving tax effect to the non recurring or non comparable items shown above, was 21.7%, (12.0)%, and 23.0% for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Net Sales The table below summarizes the overall worldwide light vehicle production percentage changes for 2010 and 2009: Worldwide Light Vehicle Year Over Year Increase (Decrease) in Production 2010 2009 North America* 38.8 % (32.4 )% Europe* 13.7 % (20.5 )% Asia* 26.5 % (2.1 )% Total Worldwide* 23.5 % (13.7 )% BorgWarner year over year net sales change 42.7 % (24.7 )% BorgWarner year over year net sales change excluding currency 45.0 % (21.5 )% * Data provided by CSM Worldwide. Our net sales increase in 2010 of 42.7% was better than the estimated worldwide market production increase of 23.5%. Our net sales decrease in 2009 of 24.7% was worse than the estimated worldwide market production decrease of 13.7%. The effect of changing currency rates had a negative impact on the Companys net sales and net earnings in 2010 and in 2009. The effect of non U.S. currencies, primarily the Euro, decreased net sales by approximately $90 million in 2010. Non US currencies had a negligible impact on the Companys net earnings in 2010. In 2009, non U.S. currencies, primarily the Euro, decreased net sales by approximately $169 million and reduced the Companys net earnings by approximately $4 million. 26 Table of Contents The year over year increase in net sales, excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, was 45% in 2010. The year over year decrease in net sales, excluding the unfavorable impact of currency, was 21.5% in 2009. Consolidated net sales to a single customer (including their subsidiaries), which exceeded 10% of our total sales, were to Volkswagen of approximately 19%, 22%, and 19%; and to Ford of approximately 11%, 12%, and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Both of our reporting segments had significant sales to the customers listed above. Such sales consisted of a variety of products to a variety of customer locations and regions. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated sales in any year of the periods presented. Outlook Our overall outlook for 2011 is positive. The Company expects global production volumes to be higher in 2011 compared with 2010. Furthermore, we expect that higher adoption rates of BorgWarner products around the world will result in sales growth for the Company above global production growth in 2011. The Company maintains a positive long term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. The trends that are driving our long term growth are expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection diesel and gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of automated transmissions in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in both Europe and Asia Pacific. Results By Reporting Segment The Companys business is comprised of two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems. The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after tax return on invested capital (ROIC) of its business initiatives. The ROIC is comprised of projected earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest (EBIT) adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates earnings and other items not reflective of on going operating profit or loss (Adjusted EBIT) compared to the projected average capital investment required. Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments. The following tables present net sales and Segment Adjusted EBIT for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008: Net Sales (millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Engine $ 4,060.8 $ 2,883.2 $ 3,861.5 Drivetrain 1,611.4 1,093.5 1,426.4 Inter segment eliminations (19.4 ) (14.9 ) (24.0 ) Net sales $ 5,652.8 $ 3,961.8 $ 5,263.9 27 Table of Contents Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Before Interest, Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interest (Adjusted EBIT) (millions of dollars) Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Engine $ 537.9 $ 219.8 $ 394.9 Drivetrain 137.0 (13.5 ) (4.9 ) Adjusted EBIT 674.9 206.3 390.0 Muncie closure retiree obligation net gain (27.9 ) Environmental litigation settlement 28.0 BERU Eichenauer equity investment gain (8.0 ) Corporate, including equity in affiliates earnings and stock based compensation 111.0 111.3 60.0 Restructuring expense 50.3 127.5 Goodwill impairment charge 156.8 Interest income (2.8 ) (2.5 ) (7.1 ) Interest expense and finance charges 68.8 57.2 38.8 Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest 477.9 17.9 14.0 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 81.7 (18.5 ) 33.3 Net earnings (loss) 396.2 36.4 (19.3 ) Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax 18.8 9.4 16.3 Net earnings (loss) attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $ 377.4 $ 27.0 $ (35.6 ) The Engine segment 2010 net sales increased $1,177.6 million, or 40.8%, and segment EBIT increased $318.1 million, or 144.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, sales increased approximately 44%. The sales increase was primarily driven by strong global growth in all major product groups as well as the second quarter 2010 acquisition of Dytech ENSA SL. The Segment EBIT margin was 13.2% in 2010, up from 7.6% in 2009, due to a significant increase in customer production schedules in the U.S. and European market and continued cost management. The Engine segment 2009 net sales were down 25.3% from 2008, with a 44.3% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period. The Engine segment decrease was primarily driven by reduced global vehicle production and depressed demand for engine products. The Segment EBIT margin was 7.6% in 2009, down from 10.2% in 2008, due to the significant reduction in customer production schedules in the U.S. and European markets. The Drivetrain segment 2010 net sales increased $517.9 million, or 47.4%, and segment EBIT increased $150.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, sales increased approximately 49%. The sales increase was primarily driven by strong growth of transmission components and torque management devices in Europe, Asia and the U.S. Segment EBIT margin was 8.5% in 2010, up from (1.2)% in 2009, primarily due to higher global production of light trucks and sport utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products and continued cost management. The Drivetrain segment 2009 net sales decreased 23.3% from 2008 with a 175.5% decrease in Segment EBIT over the same period. The group was negatively impacted by lower global production of light trucks and SUVs equipped with its torque transfer products and lower sales of its traditional transmission products. Segment EBIT margin was (1.2)% in 2009, down from (0.3)% in the prior year, primarily due to lower global production of light trucks and sport utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products. 28 Table of Contents Corporate represents corporate headquarters expenses, expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments, expenses associated with divested operations and equity in affiliates earnings. This net expense was $111.0 million in 2010, $111.3 million in 2009 and $60.0 million in 2008. The increase in Corporate expenses in 2009 from 2008 is primarily related to a decline in affiliate earnings, an increase in pension and other postemployment expenses and an increase in performance related compensation. Other Factors Affecting Results of Operations The following table details our results of operations as a percentage of sales: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 80.7 85.8 84.1 Gross profit 19.3 14.2 15.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 10.0 11.6 10.3 Restructuring expense 1.3 2.4 Goodwill impairment charge 3.0 Other (income) expense 0.4 Operating income 8.9 1.3 0.2 Equity in affiliates earnings, net of tax (0.7 ) (0.6 ) (0.7 ) Interest income (0.1 ) Interest expense and finance charges 1.2 1.4 0.7 Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest 8.4 0.5 0.3 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 1.4 (0.4 ) 0.7 Net earnings (loss) 7.0 0.9 (0.4 ) Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax 0.3 0.2 0.3 Net earnings (loss) attributable to BorgWarner Inc. 6.7 % 0.7 % (0.7 )% Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 19.3%, 14.2% and 15.9% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The gross margin percentage increase is primarily due to higher sales in 2010 and successful cost reduction actions taken in 2009 and 2008, offset by higher raw material costs. Cost reduction actions taken in 2009 and 2008 to reduce our cost structure included headcount reductions, global pay cuts, selected plant shutdowns and reduced work weeks outside of the U.S. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SGA) as a percentage of net sales were 10.0%, 11.6% and 10.3% in 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively. 2010 SGA expenses increased $106.8 million or 23.2% compared to 2009. The 2010 decrease in SGA as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a significant year over year increase in sales, offset by an increase in performance related compensation. Research and development (RD) is a major component of our SGA expenses. RD spending, net of customer reimbursements, was $185.0 million or 3.3% of sales in 2010, compared to $155.2 million, or 3.9% of sales in 2009, and $205.7 million, or 3.9% of sales in 2008. We currently intend to continue to increase our spending in RD, although the growth rate in the future may not necessarily match the rate of our sales growth. We also intend to continue to invest in a number of cross business RD programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short and long term growth. Our current long term expectation for RD spending is approximately 4.0% of sales. We intend to maintain our commitment to RD spending while continuing to focus on controlling other SGA costs. Restructuring expense of $50.3 million in 2009 and $127.5 million in 2008 was in response to declines in global customer production levels, customer restructurings and a subsequent evaluation of our headcount levels in North America, Europe and Asia and our long term capacity needs. 29 Table of Contents On July 31, 2008, the Company announced a restructuring of its operations to align ongoing operations with a continuing, fundamental market shift in the auto industry. As a continuation of the Companys third quarter restructuring, on December 11, 2008, the Company announced plans for additional restructuring actions. As a result of these third and fourth quarter 2008 restructuring actions, the Company had reduced its North American workforce by approximately 2,400 people, or 33%; its European workforce by approximately 1,600 people, or 18%; and its Asian workforce by approximately 400 people, or 17%. The restructuring expense recognized for employee termination benefits was $54.6 million. In addition to employee termination costs, the Company recorded $72.9 million of asset impairment charges related to the North American and European restructuring. The combined 2008 restructuring expenses of $127.5 million are broken out by segment as follows: Engine $85.3 million, Drivetrain $40.9 million and Corporate $1.3 million. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company took additional restructuring actions. The Company reduced its North American workforce by approximately 550 people, or 12%; its European workforce by approximately 150 people, or 2%; and its Asian workforce by approximately 60 people, or 3% in the second quarter. The net restructuring expense recognized in the second quarter was $9.0 million for employee termination benefits. In addition to employee termination costs, the Company recorded $36.3 million of asset impairment and $5.0 million of other charges in the second quarter of 2009 related to the North American and European restructuring. The combined 2009 restructuring expenses of $50.3 million are broken out by segment as follows: Engine $27.2 million, Drivetrain $19.7 million and Corporate $3.4 million. Included in the second quarter of 2009 asset impairment charge is $22.3 million related to one of the Companys European locations. During the second quarter of 2009 circumstances caused the Company to evaluate the long range outlook of the facility using an undiscounted and discounted cash flow model, both of which indicated that assets were impaired. The Company then used a replacement cost technique to determine the fair value of the assets at the facility. This reduction of asset value was included in the Engine segment. Refer to Note 17, Restructuring of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Equity in affiliates earnings, net of tax was $39.6 million, $21.8 million and $38.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This line item is primarily driven by the results of our 50% owned Japanese joint venture, NSK Warner, and our 32.6% owned Indian joint venture, Turbo Energy Limited (TEL). The significant increase in equity in affiliates earnings in 2010 is primarily due to higher vehicle production in Asia. For more discussion of NSK Warner, see Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense and finance charges were $68.8 million, $57.2 million and $38.8 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in 2010 over 2009 and 2009 over 2008 was primarily due to accretion of the discounted carrying value of our $373.8 million convertible senior notes and higher debt levels. The provision for income taxes The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate for 2010 of 17.1% compared with rates of (103.4)% in 2009 and 237.9% in 2008. The 2010 tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S., the realization of certain business tax credits including foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates earnings. Excluding the impacts of the reversal of the valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax credits, the change in tax treatment for Medicare Part D subsidies, the BERU Eichenauer equity investment gain and the Companys environmental litigation settlement, the Companys annual effective tax rate associated with on going business operations was 21.7%. The effective tax rate of (103.4%) for 2009 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due a reduction in U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S.; the realization of certain business tax credits including RD and U.S. based foreign tax credits; and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates earnings. Noncontrolling interest, net of tax of $18.8 million increased by $9.4 million from 2009 and $2.5 million from 2008. The increase between 2010 and 2009 is primarily related to higher sales and earnings by the Companys joint ventures. The increase between 2010 and 2008 is primarily related to higher sales by the Companys joint ventures, offset by the Companys increased ownership to 100% of BERU. 30 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Capitalization (millions of dollars) 2010 2009 % Change Notes payable and other short term debt $ 128.5 $ 69.1 Long term debt 1,051.9 773.2 Total debt 1,180.4 842.3 40.1 % Total equity 2,309.8 2,222.7 3.9 % Total capitalization $ 3,490.2 $ 3,065.0 13.9 % Total debt to capital ratio 33.8 % 27.5 % The $338.1 million increase in debt primarily relates to the January 1, 2010 adoption of ASC Topic 860, which required the Company to reflect its receivable securitization facility in its financial statements, as well as the Companys September 16, 2010 issuance of $250 million in 4.625% senior notes. The impact of the adoption of ASC Topic 860 is an increase in receivables, net of $80 million and an increase in notes payable and other short term debt of $80 million in the Companys 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Companys debt to capital increase also relates to the Companys second quarter 2010 $147.6 million acquisition of Dytech as well as the repurchasing of 7,066,100 shares of common stock for $325.7 million. Total equity increased by $87.1 million in 2010 as follows: (millions of dollars) Balance, January 1, 2010 $ 2,222.7 Net earnings 377.4 Stock compensation 66.3 Reissuance of treasury stock 34.1 Defined benefit post employment plans 7.8 Purchases of treasury stock (325.7 ) Currency translation and hedged instruments, net (77.1 ) All other, net 4.3 Balance, December 31, 2010 $ 2,309.8 The currency translation component of other comprehensive income decreased in 2010 primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and British Pound in relation to the U.S. Dollar. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $538.9 million, $351.0 million and $400.8 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $187.9 million increase in 2010 from 2009 primarily reflects higher earnings, offset by higher working capital needs as compared to 2009. The $538.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 consists of net earnings of $396.2 million, increased for non cash charges of $249.5 million and a $106.8 million decrease in net operating assets and liabilities. Non cash charges are primarily comprised of $252.9 million in depreciation and amortization. The $49.8 million decrease in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to lower operational earnings, somewhat offset by lower working capital needs. Inventory increased in 2010 by $79.0 million excluding the impact of currency due to higher business levels in all regions of the world. Inventory management continues to remain an area of focus for the Company as sales volumes continue to stabilize. 31 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $429.5 million, $154.8 million and $343.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This increase is primarily due to the $147.6 million acquisition of Dytech, the $9.6 million acquisition of the Companys 50/50 BERU Eichenauer joint venture, and the final $7.5 million payment for the June 2009 purchase of Etatech, Inc. Capital expenditures, including tooling outlays (capital spending) of $276.6 million in 2010, or 4.9% of sales, increased $104.6 million over the 2009 level of $172.0 million, or 4.3% of sales. Selective capital spending remains an area of focus for us, both in order to support our book of new business and for cost reduction and other purposes. Heading into 2011, we plan to continue to spend capital to support the launch of our new applications and for cost reductions and productivity improvement projects. Financing Activities and Liquidity Liquidity: The Company had $449.9 million of cash on hand at December 31, 2010. On March 31, 2010, the Company replaced its $250 million multi currency revolving credit facility with a new $550 million multi currency revolving credit facility, which includes a feature that allows the Company to increase its borrowings to $600 million. The new facility provides for borrowings through March 31, 2013, and is guaranteed by the Companys domestic subsidiaries. The Company has three key financial covenants as part of the credit agreement. These covenants are a net worth test, a debt compared to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) test, and an interest coverage test. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010 and expects to remain compliant in future periods. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. In addition to the credit facility, as of December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately $126 million available under a universal shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which a variety of debt and equity instruments could be issued. The Companys Board of Directors has authorized the filing of a new universal shelf registration with the SEC. From a credit quality perspective, the Company has a credit rating of BBB from both Standard Poors and Fitch Ratings and Baa3 from Moodys (on September 2, 2010 the Company received its first credit rating from Fitch Ratings). On October 27, 2010, Moodys upgraded the Companys credit rating from Ba1 to Baa3. The current outlook from Standard Poors, Moodys and Fitch Ratings is stable. None of the Companys debt agreements require accelerated repayment in the event of a downgrade in credit ratings. On April 24, 2009 the Companys $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was repaid. On December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility. On September 8, 2010 the Company amended the December 21, 2009 Receivable Purchase Agreement, which increased the accounts receivable securitization facility from $50 million to $80 million. This facility matures on December 21, 2012. 32 Table of Contents The Companys significant contractual obligation payments at December 31, 2010 are as follows: (millions of dollars) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 Other post employment benefits excluding pensions(a) $ 401.0 $ 27.1 $ 52.1 $ 48.5 $ 273.3 Defined benefit pension plans(b) 129.9 23.2 43.8 15.8 47.1 Notes payable and long term debt 1,210.2 128.5 389.1 10.2 682.4 Projected interest payments(c) 436.9 74.9 85.3 72.8 203.9 Non cancelable operating leases 43.0 9.3 14.3 11.4 8.0 Capital spending obligations 28.9 28.9 Inventory purchase obligations 76.9 40.1 25.3 11.5 Income tax payments(d) 134.2 134.2 Environmental(e) 29.2 21.0 2.6 0.8 4.8 Total $ 2,490.2 $ 487.2 $ 612.5 $ 171.0 $ 1,219.5 (a) Other post employment benefits excluding pensions include anticipated future payments to cover retiree medical and life insurance benefits. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys pension and other post employment benefits. (b) Since the timing and amount of payments for funded defined benefit pension plans are usually not certain for future years such potential payments are not shown in this table, except for the Companys proposed settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to make payments of $15 million per year in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Amount contained in After 2015 column are for unfunded plans and includes estimated payments through 2020. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys pension and other post employment benefits. (c) Projection is based upon actual fixed rates where appropriate, and a projected floating rate for the variable rate portion of the total debt portfolio. The floating rate projection is based upon current market conditions and rounded to the nearest 50th basis point (0.50%), which is 4.5% for this purpose. Projection is also based upon debt being redeemed upon maturity. (d) See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys income taxes. (e) See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys environmental liability. We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities and our shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation. Financing Activities: Net debt increases, excluding the impact of currency translation, were $256.3 million, $102.4 million and $107.5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The change is mostly due to the Companys September 16, 2010 issuance of $250 million in 4.625% senior notes, offset by the repurchasing of approximately 7.1 million shares of its common stock in 2010. Proceeds from stock options exercised, net of tax benefit were $67.1 million, $8.7 million and $17.1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company paid dividends to BorgWarner stockholders of $13.8 million and $51.1 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company had treasury stock purchases of $331.2 million in 2010, of which $325.7 million has been paid for as of December 31, 2010. The Company had treasury stock purchases of $55.9 million in 2008. The Company purchased approximately 0.4 million and 1.34 million BERU shares in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The cost for these shares was $46.6 million and $136.8 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively and has been reflected as payments for noncontrolling interest acquired in the Financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 18, Recent Transactions for further information. 33 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company securitizes certain receivables through third party financial institutions without recourse. The amount can vary each month based on the amount of underlying receivables. The Company continues to administer the collection of these receivables on behalf of the third party. On April 24, 2009 the Companys $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility matured and was repaid. On December 21, 2009 the Company entered into a new $50 million accounts receivable securitization facility. The Company was required to adopt amended ASC Topic 860, Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets, on January 1, 2010. This adoption required the Company to reflect its receivable securitization facility in its financial statements in the current year of change. Accounting rules prior to January 1, 2010 allowed qualifying special purpose entities off balance sheet treatment. The impact of this adoption was an increase in receivables, net of $80 million and an increase in notes payable and other short term debt of $80 million in the Companys December 31, 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet. On September 8, 2010 the Company amended the December 21, 2009 Receivable Purchase Agreement, which increased the accounts receivable securitization facility from $50 million to $80 million. This facility matures on December 21, 2012. Both the maturity and repayment; as well as the subsequent renewal of our accounts receivable securitization facility are reflected as Financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases. Types of operating leases include leases on the headquarters facility, an airplane, vehicles, and certain office equipment. The total expected future cash outlays for all lease obligations at the end of 2010 is $43.0 million. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on operating leases, including future minimum payments. Pension and Other Post Employment Benefits The Companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. At December 31, 2010, all legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed $25.1 million, $39.3 million and $13.3 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company expects to contribute a total of $30 million to $40 million in 2011. $23.2 million of the $30 million to $40 million in 2011 contributions are contractually obligated, as shown in the table above, while the remaining payments are discretionary. The funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $(210.4) million and $(229.9) million at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these amounts, $(128.0) million and $(131.1) at the end of 2010 and 2009, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence the common practice is that they are unfunded plans. Other post employment benefits primarily consist of post employment health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Companys U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other post employment benefits had an unfunded status of $(261.9) million at the end of 2010 and $(278.5) million at the end of 2009. The Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. 34 Table of Contents OTHER MATTERS Contingencies In the normal course of business the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. See Notes 7 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Companys management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Litigation In January 2006, DTP, a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America (UAW) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Courts affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTPs reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008 the Company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result of the Courts decision. DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and others, individually and as representatives of a defendant class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Courts affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror image action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009 the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase. The Company is vigorously defending against the suit. This contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the Company cannot estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any. Environmental The Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean up and other remedial activities at 38 such sites. Responsibility for clean up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula. The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter. Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, 35 Table of Contents will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance at December 31, 2010 of $28.0 million. The Company has accrued amounts that do not exceed $3.0 million related to any individual site except for the Crystal Springs site discussed below, and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next three to five years. In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company, relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre date the Companys 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. During 2000, Kuhlman Electric notified the Company that it discovered potential environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant while undertaking an expansion of the plant. The Company is continuing to work with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and Kuhlman Electric to investigate and remediate to the extent necessary, historical contamination at the plant and surrounding area. Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, were sued in numerous related lawsuits, in which multiple claimants alleged personal injury and property damage relating to the alleged environmental contamination. In 2005, the Company and other defendants entered into settlements that resolved approximately 99% of those claims and the remainder of them have since been dismissed. In 2007 and 2008, four additional lawsuits were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately 340 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to the alleged environmental contamination. One of the lawsuits, involving a single plaintiff, was dismissed by the trial court in April 2010 and the plaintiffs appeal of that decision was dismissed by the appellate court in August 2010. The Company entered into a settlement in July 2010 regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs in the other three lawsuits and those of approximately 2,700 unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs attorneys. In exchange for, among other things, the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants, the Company agreed to pay up to $28 million in settlement funds, which was expensed in the second quarter of 2010. In November 2010 the Company paid $13.9 million related to this settlement. The remaining payment of approximately $14 million is expected to be paid in February 2011. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations In March 2005, ASC Topic 410, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires the Company to recognize legal obligations to perform asset retirements in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Certain government regulations require the removal and disposal of asbestos from an existing facility at the time the facility undergoes major renovations or is demolished. The liability exists because the facility will not last forever, but it is conditional on future renovations (even if there are no immediate plans to remove the materials, which pose no health or safety hazard in their current condition). Similarly, government regulations require the removal or closure of underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks when their use ceases, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl transformers and capacitors when their use ceases, and the disposal of used furnace bricks and liners, and lead based paint in conjunction with facility renovations or demolition. The Company currently has 45 manufacturing locations that have been identified as containing these items. The fair value to remove and dispose of this material has been estimated and recorded at $1.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and $1.3 million at December 31, 2009. Product Liability Like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury actions. We believe that the Companys involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the 36 Table of Contents Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 the Company had approximately 17,000 and 23,000 pending asbestos related product liability claims, respectively. Of the 17,000 outstanding claims at December 31, 2010, approximately 8,000 were pending in just three jurisdictions, where significant tort and judicial reform activities are underway. The Companys policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2010, of the approximately 7,700 claims resolved, 245 (3.2%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In the full year of 2009, of the approximately 5,300 claims resolved, only 223 (4.2%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were covered by the Companys primary layer insurance coverage, and these carriers administered, defended, settled and paid all claims under a funding arrangement. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos related claims, the Company has substantial additional layers of insurance available for potential future asbestos related product claims. As such, the Company continues to believe that its coverage is sufficient to meet foreseeable liabilities. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. This led the Company to access the next available layer of insurance coverage. Since June 2004, secondary layer insurers have been responsible for asbestos related litigation defense and settlement expenses pursuant to a funding arrangement. A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies (CNA) against the Company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers. CNA provided the Company with both primary and additional layer insurance, and, in conjunction with other insurers, is currently defending and indemnifying the Company in its pending asbestos related product liability claims. The lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of insurance coverage available to the Company including whether the available limits exhaust on a per occurrence or an aggregate basis, and to determine how the applicable coverage responsibilities should be apportioned. On August 15, 2005, the Court issued an interim order regarding the apportionment matter. The interim order has the effect of making insurers responsible for all defense and settlement costs pro rata to time on the risk, with the pro ration method to hold the insured harmless for periods of bankrupt or unavailable coverage. Appeals of the interim order were denied. However, the issue is reserved for appellate review at the end of the action. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the State or Federal levels, due to the encapsulated nature of the products, the Companys experiences in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past, and the Companys significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does not believe that asbestos related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. To date, the Company has paid and accrued $153.1 million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement, which includes the $40.7 million referred to below, and has received $32.5 million in cash from insurers. The net outstanding balance of $120.6 million is expected to be fully recovered, of which approximately $43 million is expected to be recovered within one year. Timing of the recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above. At December 31, 2009, insurers owed $58.6 million in association with these claims. On April 5, 2010 the Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestos related action against the Company and others. The Company filed its Notice of Petition to the Supreme Court of New Jersey in late April, seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts. On July 8, 2010 the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied the Companys Notice of Petition appealing the decision of the lower courts. The total claim of $40.7 million was paid by the Company in July 2010. 37 Table of Contents In addition to the $120.6 million net outstanding balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has estimated a liability of $50.6 million for claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at December 31, 2010. The Company also has a related asset of $50.6 million to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers. Insurance carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected based on the Companys experience, its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to below. At December 31, 2009, the comparable value of the insurance asset and accrued liability was $49.9 million. The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows: (millions of dollars) 2010 2009 Assets: Prepayments and other current assets $ 25.8 $ 24.9 Other non current assets 24.8 25.0 Total insurance assets $ 50.6 $ 49.9 Liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 25.8 $ 24.9 Other non current liabilities 24.8 25.0 Total accrued liability $ 50.6 $ 49.9 The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any, in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify) in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the State or Federal levels. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. These policies require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed below. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Depreciation The automotive industry experienced unprecedented declines in production in the fourth quarter of 2008 and projected continued declines for the full year of 2009. According to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 250, future depreciation expense should be revised due to a change in the estimated future benefits inherent in an asset, the pattern of consumption of those benefits, or the information available to the entity about those benefits. As a result of the 2008 and 2009 unprecedented declines in production activity, the 38 Table of Contents Company determined that its usage pattern for certain assets had changed significantly and revised the useful lives of certain equipment starting in 2009. This adjustment was considered to be a change in an accounting estimate. The impact to the Company in 2010 and 2009 were as follows (unaudited): 2010 (millions of dollars) Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Full Year Operating income increase $ 4.8 $ 4.7 $ 4.6 $ 4.7 $ 18.8 Net earnings increase attributable to BorgWarner Inc. 3.7 3.6 3.6 3.6 14.5 Earnings per share increase Basic $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.13 Earnings per share increase Diluted $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.11 2009 (millions of dollars) Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Full Year Operating income increase $ 4.6 $ 4.6 $ 4.6 $ 4.6 $ 18.4 Net earnings increase attributable to BorgWarner Inc. 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 14.0 Earnings per share increase Basic $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.12 Earnings per share increase Diluted $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.12 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into long term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets In accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review. Such events and circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in market volumes, or project life, or a loss of a major customer application (i.e., a triggering event). The Companys impairment review is performed at each manufacturing, assembly, and technical site using data that is the basis for the Companys annual budget (or forecast on an interim basis) and long range plan (LRP). The annual budget and LRP include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments. If a triggering event has occurred, the assets are identified by the operating location and management as potentially impaired and a recoverability review is performed by management. The review will determine if a current or future alternative use exists for additional customer applications or if redeployment of the assets to any of the Companys other operating sites around the world is justified. The recoverability test compares projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of a product line or a specific customer application or asset grouping, as applicable. If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. Management believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable however, changes in assumptions with respect to future volumes, program project life or future asset use, in addition to future cash flows underlying these estimates could affect the Companys fair value evaluations. Due to the sudden decline in the global automotive markets in 2008 and 2009, the Company reviewed the carrying value of its long lived assets. As a result of these reviews, the Company recognized $36.3 million and $72.9 million in impairment of long lived assets (i.e., plant and equipment) as part of restructuring 39 Table of Contents expenses in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 and 2008 impairment charges are broken out by segment as follows: (millions of dollars) 2009 2008 Drivetrain Group $ 13.7 $ 22.1 Engine Group 22.6 50.8 Total $ 36.3 $ 72.9 See Note 17, Restructuring and Note 9 Fair Value Measurements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Companys 2009 and 2008 impairment of long lived assets and a discussion of market based measurements. Goodwill The Company annually reviews its goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year for all of its reporting units, or more often when events and circumstances warrant such a review. The Companys goodwill impairment review, under ASC Topic 350, requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of our goodwill impairment analysis is the Companys annual budget and long range plan (LRP). The annual budget and LRP include a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments. As part of the projection, we assumed the last year of the LRP data is a fair indication of the future performance, including fundamental industry growth for the business beyond the five year period into perpetuity. As the LRP is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We also utilize market valuation models and other financial ratios, which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses. We believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. The primary assumptions affecting the Companys December 31, 2010 goodwill impairment review are as follows: Discount Rate: The Company used a 10% weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant. Operating Income Margin: The Company utilized historical and expected operating income margins, which varied based on the projections of each reporting unit being evaluated. In addition to the above significant assumptions, the Company notes the following risk to volume assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model: Our industry is cyclical and our results of operations will be adversely affected by industry downturns. We are dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments. We are subject to risks related to our international operations. While the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Companys analysis related to one of its reporting units in the Engine operating segment, whose estimated fair value is 112% of its carrying value. Based on our sensitivity analysis, a 1% increase in the discount rate or a 1% decrease in the operating margin assumptions would result in the carrying value exceeding the estimated fair value of one reporting unit tested within the Engine operating segment. This would require further evaluation of the reporting units 40 Table of Contents goodwill, under a step two impairment test. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to the estimated fair value of that reporting unit. 2010 millions of dollars Impact 1 percentage point increase in discount rate $ 15.5 1 percentage point decrease in operating margin $ 11.7 In 2008 the company recorded impairment charges totaling 111.5 ($156.8) million to adjust BERUs goodwill to its estimated fair value. The impairment charge is attributable to a decrease in the operating units estimated fair value based primarily upon the effect of the decline in European market conditions on current and projected operating results. The impairment charge was also impacted by the recognition of additional goodwill in the second quarter of 2008, which was based on the court determined buy out value of 71.32 per share related to the Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement. Any differences in future results compared to managements estimates could result in fair values different from estimated fair values, which could materially impact the Companys future results of operations and financial condition. See Note 18, Recent Transactions, for further discussion on the BERU Domination and Profit Transfer Agreement. The impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009 indicated no impairment for either year, and estimated fair value to be approximately 360% and 220% for the Companys carrying value in 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill. Environmental Accrual We work with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. Managements estimate of the loss range for environmental liability, including conditional asset retirement obligations, for 2010 is between approximately $26 million and $40 million. We record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. At the end of 2010, our total accrued environmental liability was $29.2 million, which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410 of $1.2 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental accrual. Product Warranty The Company provides warranties on some of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claim settlements; as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. Our warranty provision over the last three years, and as a percentage of net sales, has trended as follows: (millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 Net Sales $ 5,652.8 $ 3,961.8 $ 5,263.9 Warranty Provision $ 39.3 $ 46.0 $ 66.1 Warranty Provision as a Percentage of Net Sales 0.70% 1.2% 1.3% 41 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change (as a percentage of sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the Companys accrued warranty liability: (Income)/Expense (millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 25 basis point decrease $ (14.1 ) $ (9.9 ) $ (13.2 ) 25 basis point increase $ 14.1 $ 9.9 $ 13.2 At the end of 2010, our total accrued warranty liability was $66.8 million. The accrual is represented as $37.0 million in current liabilities and $29.8 million in non current liabilities on our balance sheet. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding product warranty. Other Loss Accruals and Valuation Allowances The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers compensation claims, litigation, and recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. We estimate losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances. Pension and Other Post Employment Defined Benefits The Company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents. Using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions, the Companys defined benefit pension and non pension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 712. The determination of the Companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain of the more important assumptions are described in Note 11 Retirement Benefit Plans to the Companys consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10 K and include the discount rate, expected long term rate of return on plan assets, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the Companys accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics 712 and 715 as of December 31, 2010 are as follows: Expected long term rate of return on plan assets: The expected long term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. The required use of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long term returns. The expected long term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs. These inputs include historical returns for the different asset classes held by the Companys trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans invested assets. In determining its pension expense for 2010, the Company used long term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 2.00% to 9.25% outside of the U.S. and 7.50% in the U.S. 42 Table of Contents Actual return on U.S. pension assets for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 14.6%, 25.3% and (25.7%), respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% in 2010 and 2009 and 8.75% for 2008. Actual return on U.K. pension assets for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were 13.3%, 15.1% and (18.7%), respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% in 2010 and 2009 and 7.25% for 2008. Discount rate: The discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations (OPEB). The discount rate assumption is based on a constant effective yield from matching projected plan cash flows to high quality (Aa) bond yields of corresponding maturities as of the measurement date. The Company used discount rates ranging from 1.75% to 7.75% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of December 31, 2010, including weighted average discount rates of 5.17% for U.S. pension plans, 5.37% for non U.S. pension plans, and 4.75% for U.S. other post employment health care plans. The U.S. discount rate reflects the fact that our U.S. pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 (1999 for our U.S. health care plan), and with the closing of our Muncie facility in 2009, there will be negligible service cost going forward. Health care cost trend: For postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. In determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of December 31, 2010, the Company used health care cost trend rates of 7.40%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5% by the year 2019. While the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for Company sponsored U.S. and non U.S. pension plans on its 2011 pre tax pension expense: Impact on Impact on U.S. 2011 Non U.S. 2011 Pre Tax Pension Pre Tax Pension (millions of dollars) (Expense)/Income (Expense)/Income 1 percentage point decrease in discount rate * $ (3.2 ) 1 percentage point increase in discount rate * $ 3.2 1 percentage point decrease in expected return on assets $ (2.2 ) $ (1.5 ) 1 percentage point increase in expected return on assets $ 2.2 $ 1.5 * Impact of 1 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate will have a negligible impact on the Companys 2011 pre tax pension expense. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Companys U.S. OPEB interest expense: Impact on 2011 Pre Tax OPEB Interest (millions of dollars) (Expense)/Income 1 percentage point decrease in discount rate $ (1.6 ) 1 percentage point increase in discount rate $ 1.6 The sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Companys total 2011 U.S. OPEB expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains. 43 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the Companys OPEB obligation and service and interest cost: One Percentage Point (millions of dollars) Increase Decrease Effect on other post employment benefit obligation $ 18.0 $ (16.0 ) Effect on total service and interest cost components $ 0.9 $ (0.8 ) See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Companys retirement benefit plans. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In 2008 and 2009, the Company recorded a valuation allowance that primarily represented foreign net operating losses and U.S. based foreign tax credits for which utilization was uncertain. In 2010, the Company recorded a reversal of the Companys $21.2 million valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax credit carryforwards. Management judgment is required in determining the Companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the Companys net deferred tax assets. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Companys valuation allowance may be necessary. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 605. The Companys U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non U.S. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other non current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB ASC amended Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. On January 1, 2009, the Company fully adopted as required, ASC Topic 820. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the implementation of ASC Topic 820. 44 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 825, Financial Instruments. ASC Topic 825 allows entities to irrevocably elect to recognize most financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis. The stated objective of ASC Topic 825 is to improve financial reporting by giving entities the opportunity to elect to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in order to mitigate earnings volatility caused when related assets and liabilities are measured differently. ASC Topic 825 was effective for the Company beginning with its quarter ending March 31, 2008. The Company chose to not make the election to adopt. In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 805, Business Combinations. ASC Topic 805 establishes principles and requirements for recognizing identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, goodwill acquired in the combination or the gain from a bargain purchase, and disclosure requirements. Under this revised statement, all costs incurred to effect an acquisition are recognized separately from the acquisition. Also, restructuring costs that are expected but the acquirer is not obligated to incur are recognized separately from the acquisition. On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 805. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company expensed $4.8 million related to on going acquisition related activity. In December 2007, the FASB ASC amended Topic 810, Consolidation. For consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned, the third party holdings of equity interests are referred to as noncontrolling interests. The portion of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as net income (loss) applicable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of operation, and the portion of stockholders equity of such subsidiaries is presented as noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 810. The adoption of ASC Topic 810 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, it did impact the presentation and disclosure of noncontrolling (minority) interests in our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. As a result of the retrospective presentation and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 810, the Company was required to reflect the change in presentation and disclosure for the period ending March 31, 2009 and all periods presented in future filings. The principal effect on the prior year balance sheets related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions of dollars) Balance Sheet December 31, 2008 Total equity, as previously reported $ 2,006.0 Increase for Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest 31.5 Total equity, as adjusted $ 2,037.5 The principal effect on the prior year statement of operations related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions of dollars) Year Ended Consolidated Statement of Operations December 31, 2008 Net loss, as previously reported $ (35.6 ) Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest (16.3 ) Net loss, as adjusted $ (19.3 ) Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest 16.3 Net loss attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $ (35.6 ) 45 Table of Contents The principal effect on the prior year statement of cash flows related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions of dollars) Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 Net loss, as previously reported $ (35.6 ) Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest (16.3 ) Net loss, as adjusted $ (19.3 ) (millions of dollars) Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 Equity in affiliates earnings, net of dividends received, minority interest and other, as previously reported $ 28.3 Less: Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest (16.3 ) Equity in affiliates earnings, net of dividends received and other $ 12.0 The principal effect on the prior year comprehensive income related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions of dollars) December 31, 2008 Net foreign currency translation and hedge instruments adjustment, as previously reported $ (136.9 ) Topic 810 reclass of noncontrolling interest (10.8 ) Net foreign currency translation and hedge instruments adjustment, as adjusted $ (126.1 ) Due to the adoption of ASC Topic 810, the Company revised the presentation of cash payments related to the acquisition of noncontrolling (minority) interests from the Investing to the Financing section of the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The principal effect on the prior year cash flows related to the adoption of ASC Topic 810 is summarized as follows: (millions of dollars) Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 Payments for businesses acquired, net of cash acquired, as previously reported $ (141.2 ) Less: Topic 805 reclass of noncontrolling interest 141.2 Payments for businesses acquired, net of cash acquired $ (millions of dollars) Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 Net cash used in investing activities, as previously reported $ (485.1 ) Less: Topic 805 reclass of noncontrolling interest 141.2 Net cash used in investing activities $ (343.9 ) (millions of dollars) Year Ended Statement of Cash Flows December 31, 2008 Net cash provided by financing activities, as previously reported $ 5.1 Less: Topic 805 reclass of noncontrolling interest (141.2 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (136.1 ) 46 Table of Contents In March 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. ASC Topic 815 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under ASC Topic 815 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted ASC Topic 815. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the implementation of ASC Topic 815. In May 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 470, Debt. Under ASC Topic 470, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuers interest cost. ASC Topic 470 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with retrospective application required. As a result of our adoption of ASC Topic 470 for fiscal 2009 and the Companys April 9, 2009 issuance of $373.8 million convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012, we recorded the equity and liability components of the notes on our December 31, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, ASC Topic 470 requires us to accrete the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face value over the term of the notes. The Companys interest expense associated with this amortization is based on the effective interest rate of the convertible senior notes of 9.365%. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. In December 2008, the FASB ASC amended Topic 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits. ASC Topic 715 requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made, the major categories of plan assets, the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value of plan assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. See Note 9 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the implementation of ASC Topic 715. In June 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 860, Accounting for Transfer of Financial Assets. ASC Topic 860 removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and removes the exception from applying ASC Topic 810, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to qualifying special purpose entities. This Statement modifies the financial components approach used in ASC Topic 860 and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized. Additionally, enhanced disclosures are required to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about transfers of financial assets and a transferors continuing involvement with transferred financial assets. On January 1, 2010, the Company elected to prospectively adopt ASC Topic 860. The impact of this adoption is an increase in receivables, net of $80 million and an increase in notes payable and other short term debt of $80 million in the Companys December 31, 2010 Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the implementation of ASC Topic 860. In June 2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. ASC Topic 810 requires an ongoing reassessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Additionally, ASC Topic 810 requires enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprises involvement in variable interest entities. On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted ASC Topic 810. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB ASC amended Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This ASC Topic instituted a major change in the way accounting standards are organized. The accounting standards Codification became the single official source of authoritative, nongovernmental GAAP. As of September 30, 2009 only one level of authoritative GAAP exists, other than guidance issued by the SEC. All other literature is non authoritative. The Company adopted the Codification in the third quarter of 2009. The adoption of the Codification had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 47 Table of Contents QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks. We have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. For quantitative disclosures about market risk, please refer to Note 10, Financial Instruments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At the end of 2010, the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 69.5% of total debt, including the impact of the interest rate swaps. Our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates. A 10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately $1.6 million in 2010, and $1.5 million in 2009. We also measure interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10% change in interest rates as of December 31, 2010, the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $28.0 million if interest rates decreased and would decrease by approximately $26.0 million if interest rates increased. Our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves. The model, therefore, does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2009, measured in a similar manner, was slightly more than at December 31, 2010. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the British Pound, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the Japanese Yen, and the South Korean Won. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps. Such non U.S. Dollar debt was $299.0 million as of December 31, 2010 and $303.1 million as of December 31, 2009. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $2.7 million and 48 Table of Contents $(6.4) million, respectively, of which $2.6 million in gains and $(3.3) million in losses mature in less than one year. As of December 31, 2010, $(0.1) million in losses did not qualify for deferral. Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. Commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had forward and option commodity contracts with a total notional value of $1.2 million. Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements The matters discussed in this Item 7 include forward looking statements. See Forward Looking Statements at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 49 Table of Contents REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The information in this report is the responsibility of management. BorgWarner Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries (the Company) has in place reporting guidelines and policies designed to ensure that the statements and other information contained in this report present a fair and accurate financial picture of the Company. In fulfilling this management responsibility, we make informed judgments and estimates conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The internal control process includes those policies and procedures that: Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on managements assessment and those criteria, we believe that, as of December 31, 2010, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Companys consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 as stated in their report. The Companys Audit Committee, composed entirely of directors of the Company who are not employees, meets periodically with the Companys management and independent registered public accounting firm to review financial results and procedures, internal financial controls and internal and external audit plans and recommendations. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Audit Committee and the independent registered public accounting firm have unrestricted access to each other with or without the presence of management representatives. /s/ Timothy M.
