No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in any of the years presented.27Table of Contents The following table details our results of operations as a percentage of net sales: Year Ended December 31,(percentage of net sales)2011 2010 2009Net sales100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of sales80.2 80.7 85.8Gross profit19.8 19.3 14.2Selling, general and administrative expenses8.7 10.0 11.6Restructuring expense 1.3Other (income) expense(0.1) 0.4 Operating income11.2 8.9 1.3Equity in affiliates earnings, net of tax(0.5) (0.7) (0.6)Interest income(0.1) Interest expense and finance charges1.0 1.2 1.4Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest10.8 8.4 0.5Provision (benefit) for income taxes2.8 1.4 (0.4)Net earnings8.0 7.0 0.9Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax0.3 0.3 0.2Net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. 7.7 % 6.7 % 0.7 %Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was 80.2%, 80.7% and 85.8% in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Companys material cost of sales was approximately 50% of net sales in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Companys remaining cost to convert raw material to finished product, which includes direct labor and manufacturing overhead, has continued to improve during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 as a result of increased net sales and successful cost reduction actions. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 19.8%, 19.3% and 14.2% in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percentage of net sales were 8.7%, 10.0% and 11.6% in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. SG&A expenses increased $54.4 million, or 9.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to the $58.7 million, or 31.7%, increase in research and development ("R&D") costs, which are included in SG&A expenses. SG&A as a percentage of net sales has continued to improve during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of significant year over year increases in net sales. R&D costs, net of customer reimbursements, was $243.7 million, or 3.4% of net sales, in the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $185.0 million, or 3.3% of net sales, and $155.2 million, or 3.9% of net sales, in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We will continue to invest in a number of cross business R&D programs, as well as a number of other key programs, all of which are necessary for short and long term growth. Our current long term expectation for R&D spending is approximately 4% of net sales. Restructuring expense of $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, included $9.0 million relating to employee termination benefits, $36.3 million of asset impairment charges and $5.0 million of other charges. The Companys restructuring actions reduced its North American workforce by approximately 550 people, or 12%; its European workforce by approximately 150 people, or 2%; and its Asian workforce by approximately 60 people, or 3%. Refer to Note 17, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.28Table of Contents Equity in affiliates earnings, net of tax was $38.2 million, $39.6 million and $21.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This line item is primarily driven by the results of our 50% owned Japanese joint venture, NSK Warner, and our 32.6% owned Indian joint venture, Turbo Energy Limited (TEL). The decrease in equity in affiliates earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily due to lower production volumes in Japan as a result of natural disasters. The significant increase in equity in affiliates earnings for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to higher vehicle production in Asia. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of NSK Warner.Interest expense and finance charges were $74.6 million, $68.8 million and $57.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Interest expense and finance charges have increased for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to higher debt levels.Provision (benefit) for income taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with rates of 17.1% and (103.4)% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate of 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011 includes $11.0 million of additional tax expense associated with the Companys patent infringement settlement, $2.7 million of additional tax expense associated with the loss on disposals and tax benefit of $6.2 million resulting from other tax adjustments. These other tax adjustments related to a change in state corporate income tax legislation as well as an adjustment of the Companys tax accounts as a result of the closure of certain tax audits. This rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S., the realization of certain business tax credits including foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates earnings. Excluding the impact of the patent infringement settlement, loss on disposals and the other tax adjustments mentioned above, the Companys annual effective tax rate associated with ongoing operations for 2011 was 24.8%.The effective tax rate of 17.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S., the realization of certain business tax credits including foreign tax credits and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates earnings. Excluding the impacts of the reversal of the valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax credits, the change in tax treatment for Medicare Part D subsidies, the BERU Eichenauer equity investment gain and the Companys environmental litigation settlement, the Companys annual effective tax rate associated with on going business operations was 21.7%. The effective tax rate of (103.4)% for the year ended December 31, 2009 differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due a reduction in U.S. income; foreign rates, which differ from those in the U.S.; the realization of certain business tax credits including R&D and U.S. based foreign tax credits; and favorable permanent differences between book and tax treatment for items, including equity in affiliates earnings. Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax of $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $1.7 million and $11.1 million from the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increases during the year ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 are primarily related to higher sales and earnings by the Companys joint ventures. 29Table of Contents Results By Reporting SegmentThe Companys business is comprised of two reporting segments: Engine and Drivetrain. These segments are strategic business groups, which are managed separately as each represents a specific grouping of related automotive components and systems. The Company allocates resources to each segment based upon the projected after tax return on invested capital ("ROIC") of its business initiatives. ROIC is comprised of Adjusted EBIT after deducting notional taxes compared to the projected average capital investment required. Adjusted EBIT is comprised of earnings before interest, income taxes and noncontrolling interest (EBIT") adjusted for restructuring, goodwill impairment charges, affiliates earnings and other items not reflective of on going operating profit or loss.Adjusted EBIT is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the Company. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our reporting segments.The following tables present segment information, including sales and Adjusted EBIT, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:Net Sales Year Ended December 31,(millions of dollars)2011 2010 2009Engine$5,050.6 $4,060.8 $2,883.2Drivetrain2,084.5 1,611.4 1,093.5Inter segment eliminations(20.4) (19.4) (14.9)Net sales$7,114.7 $5,652.8 $3,961.8Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes and Noncontrolling Interest ("Adjusted EBIT") Year Ended December 31,(millions of dollars)2011 2010 2009Engine$774.3 $537.9 $219.8Drivetrain161.2 137.0 (13.5)Adjusted EBIT935.5 674.9 206.3Patent infringement settlement gain, net of legal costs incurred(29.1) Loss from disposal activities21.5 Environmental litigation settlement 28.0 BERU Eichenauer equity investment gain (8.0) Muncie closure retiree obligation net gain (27.9)Corporate, including equity in affiliates earnings and stock based compensation107.4 111.0 111.3Restructuring expense 50.3Interest income(4.8) (2.8) (2.5)Interest expense and finance charges74.6 68.8 57.2Earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interest765.9 477.9 17.9Provision (benefit) for income taxes195.3 81.7 (18.5)Net earnings570.6 396.2 36.4Net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest, net of tax20.5 18.8 9.4Net earnings attributable to BorgWarner Inc. $550.1 $377.4 $27.030Table of Contents The Engine segments net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $989.8 million, or 24.4%, and segment EBIT increased $236.4 million, or 43.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, and the second quarter 2010 acquisition of Dytech ENSA S.L., net sales increased approximately 18%. The Segment EBIT margin was 15.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011, up from 13.2% in the year ended December 31, 2010. The net sales and Segment EBIT increases were primarily driven by strong global growth in all major product groups and continued cost management. The Engine segments net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $1,177.6 million, or 40.8%, and segment EBIT increased $318.1 million, or 144.7%, from the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, and the purchase of Dytech Ensa S.L., net sales increased approximately 38%. The net sales increase was primarily driven by strong global growth in all major product groups. The Segment EBIT margin was 13.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010, up from 7.6% in the year ended December 31, 2009, due to a significant increase in customer production schedules in the U.S. and European markets and continued cost management. The Drivetrain segments net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $473.1 million, or 29.4%, and segment EBIT increased $24.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of strengthening foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, and the first quarter 2011 acquisition of Haldex Traction AB, net sales increased approximately 14%. The net sales increase was a result of strong four wheel drive system and traditional transmission component sales in South Korea and higher dual clutch transmission module sales in Europe. The Segment EBIT margin was 7.7% in the year ended December 31, 2011, down from 8.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily due to operational inefficiencies in its European operations and Traction Systems acquisition related expenses.The Drivetrain segments net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $517.9 million, or 47.4%, and segment EBIT increased $150.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2009. Excluding the impact of weaker foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, net sales increased approximately 49%. The net sales increase was primarily driven by strong growth of transmission components and torque management devices in Europe, Asia and the U.S. The Segment EBIT margin was 8.5% in the year ended December 31, 2010, up from (1.2)% in the year ended December 31, 2009, primarily due to higher global production of light trucks and sport utility vehicles equipped with its torque transfer products and continued cost management.Corporate represents headquarters expenses not directly attributable to the individual segments, expenses associated with divested operations and equity in affiliates earnings. This net expense was $107.4 million, $111.0 million and $111.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. OutlookOur overall outlook for 2012 is positive. The Company expects global production volumes to be higher in 2012 compared with 2011. In Europe, we expect production volumes to decline in 2012 compared with 2011. However, we expect that higher adoption rates of BorgWarner products around the world will result in sales growth for the Company above global production growth in 2012. The Company maintains a positive long term outlook for its global business and is committed to new product development and strategic capital investments to enhance its product leadership strategy. The trends that are driving our long term growth are expected to continue, including the growth of direct injection diesel and gasoline engines worldwide, the increased adoption of automated transmissions in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the move to variable cam and chain engine timing systems in both Europe and Asia Pacific. 31Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe Company had $359.6 million of cash on hand at December 31, 2011.

Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $708.2 million, $538.9 million and $351.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily reflects higher earnings. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily reflects higher earnings, offset by higher working capital needs. Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $564.5 million, $429.5 million and $154.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This increases in the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 are primarily due to increased capital spending and higher payments for businesses acquired, net of cash acquired. Year over year capital spending increases of $117.1 million and $104.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, were primarily due to higher spending levels required to meet increased level of program launches worldwide.Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities was $219.7 million and $13.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys pension benefits.(c)The Companys 3.50% convertible senior notes due April 15, 2012, with a face value of $373.8 million, will be settled in common stock currently held in treasury.(d)Projection is based upon actual fixed rates where appropriate, and a projected floating rate for the variable rate portion of the total debt portfolio. The floating rate projection is based upon current market conditions and rounded to the nearest 50th basis point (0.50%), which is 5.5% for this purpose. Projection is also based upon debt being redeemed upon maturity.(e)See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys income taxes.(f)See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the Companys environmental contingencies.We believe that the combination of cash from operations, cash balances, available credit facilities and the remaining shelf registration capacity will be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs for our current level of operations and our planned operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to balance our needs for internal growth, external growth, debt reduction and cash conservation.Off Balance Sheet ArrangementsThe Company has certain leases that are recorded as operating leases. Types of operating leases include leases on the headquarters facility, an airplane, vehicles and certain office equipment. The total expected future cash outlays for operating lease obligations at December 31, 2011 is $72.8 million. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on operating leases, including future minimum payments.Pension and Other Post Employment BenefitsThe Companys policy is to fund its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with applicable government regulations and to make additional contributions when appropriate. At December 31, 2011, all 34Table of Contents legal funding requirements had been met. The Company contributed $37.0 million, $25.1 million and $39.3 million to its defined benefit pension plans in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company expects to contribute a total of $30 million to $40 million into its defined benefit pension plans during 2012, including $15 million related to the Companys settlement agreement with the PBGC. Of the $30 million to $40 million in projected 2012 contributions, $21.5 million are contractual obligations, while the remaining payments are discretionary.The funded status of all pension plans was a net unfunded position of $236.4 million and $210.4 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Of these amounts, $128.7 million and $128.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were related to plans in Germany, where there is not a tax deduction allowed under the applicable regulations to fund the plans; hence the common practice is to make contributions as benefit payments become due.Other post employment benefits primarily consist of post employment health care benefits for certain employees and retirees of the Companys U.S. operations. The Company funds these benefits as retiree claims are incurred. Other post employment benefits had an unfunded status of $251.0 million and $261.9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company believes it will be able to fund the requirements of these plans through cash generated from operations or other available sources of financing for the foreseeable future.See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits. OTHER MATTERSContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to various commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving warranty claims, intellectual property claims, general liability and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company will ultimately be successful in any of these commercial and legal matters or, if not, what the impact might be. The Companys environmental and product liability contingencies are discussed separately below. The Companys management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims, actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Litigation In January 2006, BorgWarner Diversified Transmission Products Inc. ("DTP"), a subsidiary of the Company, filed a declaratory judgment action in United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implements Workers of America (UAW) Local No. 287 and Gerald Poor, individually and as the representative of a defendant class. DTP sought the Courts affirmation that DTP did not violate the Labor Management Relations Act or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective April 1, 2006 and October 1, 2006, prior to the expiration of the then current collective bargaining agreements. On September 10, 2008, the Court found that DTPs reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the UAW, which did not expire until April 24, 2009. Thus, the amendments were untimely. In 2008, the Company recorded a charge of $4.0 million as a result of the Courts decision.DTP filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis Division) against the UAW Local No. 287 and Jim Barrett and others, individually and as 35Table of Contents representatives of a defendant class, on February 26, 2009 again seeking the Courts affirmation that DTP will not violate the Labor Management Relations Act or ERISA by modifying the level of benefits provided retirees to make them comparable to other Company retiree benefit plans after April 24, 2009. Certain retirees, on behalf of themselves and others, filed a mirror image action in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) on March 11, 2009, for which a class has been certified. During the last quarter of 2009, the action pending in Indiana was dismissed, while the action in Michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase. The Company is vigorously defending against the suit. This contingency is subject to many uncertainties, therefore based on the information available to date, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss, if any. EnvironmentalThe Company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors, subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and equivalent state laws and, as such, may presently be liable for the cost of clean up and other remedial activities at 39 such sites. Responsibility for clean up and other remedial activities at a Superfund site is typically shared among PRPs based on an allocation formula.The Company believes that none of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Generally, this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other PRPs, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.Based on information available to the Company (which in most cases includes: an estimate of allocation of liability among PRPs; the probability that other PRPs, many of whom are large, solvent public companies, will fully pay the cost apportioned to them; currently available information from PRPs and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs; remediation alternatives; and estimated legal fees), the Company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance of $10.4 million at December 31, 2011. The accrued amounts do not exceed $3.0 million related to any individual site except for the Crystal Springs site discussed below, and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years.In connection with the sale of Kuhlman Electric Corporation, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyer and Kuhlman Electric for certain environmental liabilities, then unknown to the Company, relating to certain operations of Kuhlman Electric that pre date the Companys 1999 acquisition of Kuhlman Electric. In 2007 and 2008, lawsuits were filed against Kuhlman Electric and others, including the Company, on behalf of approximately 340 plaintiffs, alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its Crystal Springs, Mississippi plant. The Company entered into a settlement in July 2010 regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs and those of approximately 2,700 unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs attorneys. In exchange for, among other things, the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants, the Company agreed to pay up to $28 million in settlement funds, which was expensed in the second quarter of 2010. The Company paid $13.9 million in November 2010 and made the final payment of $13.9 million in February 2011. Litigation concerning indemnification is pending and the Company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings.36Table of Contents Product LiabilityLike many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the U.S., the Company (or parties the Company is obligated to indemnify) continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury actions. We believe that the Companys involvement is limited because, in general, these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos. The nature of the fibers, the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the Company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company had approximately 16,000 and 17,000 pending asbestos related product liability claims, respectively. Of the approximately 16,000 outstanding claims at December 31, 2011, approximately half were pending in jurisdictions that have undergone significant tort and judicial reform activities subsequent to the filing of these claims.The Companys policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the Company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment. The Company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos related product liability claims where it is a defendant (or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant) will result in no payment being made by the Company or its insurers. In 2011, of the approximately 1,800 claims resolved, 288 (16%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. In the full year of 2010, of the approximately 7,700 claims resolved, 245 (3%) resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the Company. Prior to June 2004, the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the Companys primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements. In addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos related claims, the Company has substantial excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos related product claims. In June 2004, primary layer insurance carriers notified the Company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits. A declaratory judgment action was filed in January 2004 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by Continental Casualty Company and related companies (CNA) against the Company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers. The court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing. CNA and the Company have entered into a settlement agreement resolving their coverage disputes, pursuant to which CNA will pay amounts over the next four years to the Company. The Company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers.Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels, due to the encapsulated nature of the products, the Companys experience in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past, and the Companys significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing, management does not believe that asbestos related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows.To date, the Company has paid and accrued $190.9 million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received $81.1 million in cash and notes from insurers, including CNA. The net balance of $109.8 million, is expected to be fully recovered, of which approximately $33 million is estimated to be recovered within one year. Timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements. At December 31, 2010, insurers owed $120.6 million in association with these claims.On April 5, 2010, the Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestos related action against the Company and others. The Company filed its Notice of Petition to the Supreme Court of New Jersey in late April, seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts. On July 8, 2010 the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied the Companys Notice of Petition appealing the decision of the lower courts. The total claim of $40.7 million was paid by the Company in July 2010.37Table of Contents In addition to the $109.8 million net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs, the Company has estimated a liability of $61.7 million for claims asserted, but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at December 31, 2011. The Company also has a related asset of $61.7 million to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers. Insurance carrier reimbursement of 100% is expected based on the Companys experience, its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to above. At December 31, 2010, the comparable value of the insurance asset and accrued liability was $50.6 million.The amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows: December 31,(millions of dollars)2011 2010Assets: Prepayments and other current assets$28.8 $25.8Other non current assets32.9 24.8Total insurance assets$61.7 $50.6Liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses$28.8 $25.8Other non current liabilities32.9 24.8Total accrued liabilities$61.7 $50.6The Company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses, if any, in excess of those for which it has accrued, because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the Company (or parties the Company has an obligation to indemnify) in the future, the allegations in such claims, the possible outcomes, or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the State or Federal levels.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our most critical accounting policies are discussed below.Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes, as well as, the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is usually upon shipment of product. Although the Company may enter into long term supply agreements with its major customers, each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements.38Table of Contents Cost of sales The Company includes materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales. Manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials, indirect labor, factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale.Impairment of long lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets The Company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets, whether held for use or disposal, including other amortizable intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant such a review under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 360. A recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event. If the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, management will perform a fair value analysis. Management determines fair value under ASC Topic 820 using the appropriate valuation technique of market, income or cost approach. If the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value. Management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations. Long lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long lived assets for impairment include: (i) an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review; (ii) undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset; and (iii) fair value of the asset. The Company recognized $36.3 million of asset impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2009 within restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 17, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Companys impairment of long lived assets and a discussion of market based measurements.Goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets During the fourth quarter of each year or upon a triggering event, the Company reviews the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units to identify those units with a fair value more likely than not less than its carrying value. With the exception of two reporting units that had recent acquisition or divestiture activity, a qualitative assessment was completed. This assessment evaluated various events and circumstances, such as macro economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, relevant events and financial trends, that may impact a reporting units fair value. After completing this assessment, the Company determined it was more likely than not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units qualitatively reviewed. A quantitative, "step one," impairment analysis, therefore, was not required.For the two reporting units with recent acquisition or divestiture activity, the Company performed a quantitative, "step one," goodwill impairment analysis, which requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, discount rates and growth rates. The basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the Companys annual budget and long range plan (LRP). The annual budget and LRP includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the LRP data is a fair indication of the future performance. Because the LRP is estimated over a significant future period of time, those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Further, the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the Company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the Companys facts and circumstances. The Company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine its estimated fair value are reasonable. Different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value. 39Table of Contents The primary assumptions affecting the Companys December 31, 2011 goodwill quantitative, "step one," impairment review are as follows:Discount rate: The Company used a 10% weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as the discount rate for future cash flows. The WACC is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant. Operating income margin: The Company used historical and expected operating income margins, which may vary based on the projections of each reporting unit being evaluated. In addition to the above primary assumptions, the Company notes the following risk to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model:The automotive industry is cyclical and the Companys results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns. The Company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments.The Company is subject to risks related to international operations.Based on the assumptions outlined above, the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of 2011 indicated the Companys goodwill assigned to the two reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was completed indicating a 1% increase in the discount rate or a 1% decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of either of the reporting units quantitatively assessed. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill.Product warranties The Company provides warranties on some, but not all, of its products. The warranty terms are typically from one to three years. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties. Management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims. Management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate; however, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to the accrual. Our warranty provision over the last three years, and as a percentage of net sales, has trended as follows: Year Ended December 31,(millions of dollars)2011 2010 2009Net sales$7,114.7 $5,652.8 $3,961.8Warranty provision$47.5 $39.3 $46.0Warranty provision as a percentage of net sales0.7% 0.7% 1.2%40Table of Contents The following table illustrates the sensitivity of a 25 basis point change (as a percentage of net sales) in the assumed warranty trend on the Companys accrued warranty liability: December 31,(millions of dollars)2011 2010 200925 basis point decrease (income)/expense$(17.8) $(14.1) $(9.9)25 basis point increase (income)/expense$17.8 $14.1 $9.9At December 31, 2011, the total accrued warranty liability was $72.7 million. The accrual is represented as $38.6 million in current liabilities and $34.1 million in non current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding product warranties.Other loss accruals and valuation allowances The Company has numerous other loss exposures, such as customer claims, workers compensation claims, litigation and recoverability of assets. Establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization. The Company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods; however, changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances.Environmental contingencies The Company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites. The ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability. Managements estimate of the loss range for environmental liability, including conditional asset retirement obligations, for 2011 is between approximately $8 million and $23 million. We record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined; in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range. At December 31, 2011, our total accrued environmental liability was $11.5 million, which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under ASC Topic 410 of $1.1 million.See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental accrual.Pension and other post employment defined benefits The Company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees. Costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees, retirees and surviving spouses and dependents. The Companys defined benefit pension and non pension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715. Disability, early retirement and other postemployment employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 712. The determination of the Companys obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits, such as retiree health care, is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts. Certain assumptions, including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in Note 11, Retirement Benefit Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with GAAP. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods. The primary assumptions affecting the Companys accounting for employee benefits under ASC Topics 712 and 715 as of December 31, 2011 are as follows:41Table of Contents Expected long term rate of return on plan assets: The expected long term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost. The required use of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long term returns. The expected long term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs, including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the Companys trusts and its asset allocation, as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return, inflation and other variables. The Company also considers the impact of active management of the plans invested assets. In determining its pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company used long term rates of return on plan assets ranging from 1.75% to 9.00% outside of the U.S. and 7.50% in the U.S.Actual returns on U.S. pension assets were 3.7%, 14.6% and 25.3% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Actual returns on U.K. pension assets were 3.3%, 13.3% and 15.1% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, compared to the expected rate of return assumption of 7.50% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Discount rate: The discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations (OPEB). The discount rate assumption is based on a constant effective yield from matching projected plan cash flows to high quality (Aa) bond yields of corresponding maturities as of the measurement date. The Company used discount rates ranging from 1.75% to 8.00% to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of December 31, 2011, including weighted average discount rates of 4.42% in the U.S., 5.13% outside of the U.S., and 4.25% for U.S. other post employment health care plans. The U.S. discount rate reflects the fact that our U.S. pension plan has been closed for new participants since 1989 (1999 for our U.S. health care plan), and with the closing of our Muncie facility in 2009, there will be negligible service cost going forward.Health care cost trend: For postretirement employee health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and Company specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. In determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of December 31, 2011, the Company used health care cost trend rates of 7.10%, declining to an ultimate trend rate of 5% by the year 2019.While the Company believes that these assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the Companys pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for Company sponsored U.S. and non U.S. pension plans on its 2012 pre tax pension expense:(millions of dollars)Impact on U.S. 2012 pre tax pension (expense)/income Impact on Non U.S. 2012 pre tax pension (expense)/income1 percentage point decrease in discount rate$* $(3.2)1 percentage point increase in discount rate$* $3.21 percentage point decrease in expected return on assets$(2.8) $(1.4)1 percentage point increase in expected return on assets$2.8 $1.4 * A 1 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the Companys U.S. 2012 pre tax pension expense.42Table of Contents The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Companys U.S. OPEB interest expense: (millions of dollars)Impact on 2012 pre tax OPEB interest (expense)/income1 percentage point decrease in discount rate$(1.6)1 percentage point increase in discount rate$1.6The sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the Companys total 2012 U.S. OPEB expense is expected to be negligible, as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains.The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the Companys OPEB obligation and service and interest cost: One Percentage Point(millions of dollars)Increase DecreaseEffect on other post employment benefit obligation$18.3 $(16.1)Effect on total service and interest cost components$0.8 $(0.7)See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Companys retirement benefit plans.Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In 2009, the Company recorded a valuation allowance that primarily represented foreign net operating losses and U.S. based foreign tax credits for which utilization was uncertain. In 2010, the Company recorded a reversal of the Companys $21.2 million valuation allowance on U.S. based foreign tax credit carryforwards. Management judgment is required in determining the Companys provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the Companys net deferred tax assets. In calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis, the Company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. Since future financial results may differ from previous estimates, periodic adjustments to the Companys valuation allowance may be necessary. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. at the federal and state level and numerous non U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain. Accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 605. The Companys U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non U.S. income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities. Although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain, management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax 43Table of Contents returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments, if any, which may be proposed by the taxing authorities. At December 31, 2011, the Company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not loss on certain of its tax positions, which is included in other non current liabilities. Nonetheless, the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income taxes. New Accounting PronouncementsIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended ASC Topic 210, "Balance Sheet," requiring companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. This guidance is effective retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company anticipates the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 350, "Intangibles Goodwill and Other," allowing companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in ASC Topic 350. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard for the year ended December 31, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 220, "Comprehensive Income," which requires the presentation of the components of net income and comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two consecutive statements and requires companies to separately disclose reclassifications from other comprehensive income into net income on the face of the financial statements. This guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will reflect the change in presentation in all periods presented in future filings beginning with the period ending March 31, 2012. In December 2011, the FASB indefinitely deferred the requirement to separately disclose reclassifications from other comprehensive income into net income on the face of the Statement of Operations. In May 2011, the FASB amended ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement guidance and amends the guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company anticipates the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2009, the FASB amended ASC Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition," which amends the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements and expands the disclosure requirements related to these arrangements. On January 1, 2011, the Company adopted this amendment to ASC Topic 605. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.44Table of Contents QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISKThe Companys primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations. Some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers. Other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies, which include forward contracts. The Company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses. We do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks.We have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk, which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk. For quantitative disclosures about market risk, please refer to Note 10, "Financial Instruments," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. The Company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates (fair value hedges). At December 31, 2011, the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was 62.4% of total debt, including the impact of the interest rate swaps. Our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates. A 10% increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately $1.8 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.The Company also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10% increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2011, the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $24 million. Assuming a hypothetical instantaneous 10% decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2011, the net fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately $23 million. Our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves. The model, therefore, does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2011, measured in a similar manner, was slightly less than at December 31, 2010.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskForeign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, our most significant currency exposures relate to the British Pound, the Euro, the Hungarian Forint, the Japanese Yen, the Swedish Krona and the South Korean Won. We mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve, by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps. Such non U.S. Dollar debt was $280.4 million and $299.0 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments. In addition, the Company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate 45Table of Contents risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of $2.7 million and $(2.9) million, respectively, of which $2.6 million in gains and $(2.4) million in losses mature in less than one year. Commodity Price RiskCommodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products. Commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no forward and option commodity contracts outstanding.
