Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the historical consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes thereto. Forward Looking Statements Statements made under the caption "Risk Factors," elsewhere in this Form 10 K, in our press releases, and in oral statements we make by or with the approval of our authorized executives contain "forward looking statements" within the meaning of federal securities laws. When we use the words "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend" and other similar expressions, they generally identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include, for example, statements relating to acquisitions and related financial information, development activities, business strategy and prospects, future capital expenditures, sources and availability of capital, environmental and other regulations, and competition. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward looking statements since they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our control and could materially affect our actual results, performance or achievements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we are subject to general risks affecting the real estate industry, such as the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on favorable terms to generate rental revenues, and dependence on our tenants financial condition; we may fail to identify, acquire, construct or develop additional properties; we may develop properties that do not produce a desired yield on invested capital; or we may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties; financing may not be available, or may not be available on favorable terms; we need to make distributions to our stockholders for us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, and if we need to borrow the funds to make such distributions such borrowings may not be available on favorable terms; we depend on the primary markets where our properties are located and these markets may be adversely affected by local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; we are subject to potential environmental liabilities; we are subject to complex regulations relating to our status as a real estate investment trust and would be adversely affected if we failed to qualify as a real estate investment trust; and market interest rates could adversely affect the market prices for our common stock, as well as our performance and cash flow. We caution you that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a fully integrated, self administered and self managed real estate investment trust or "REIT" and are one of the largest owners and developers of office and industrial properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in four core markets Boston, Washington, D.C., 27 midtown Manhattan and San Francisco. We conduct substantially all of our business through Boston Properties Limited Partnership. At December 31, 2001, we owned 147 properties totaling 40.7 million net rentable square feet. The properties consisted of 139 office properties, including 107 Class A office buildings and 32 properties that support both office and technical uses, including twelve properties under construction, five industrial properties, and three hotels. In 2001, we continued to identify and complete acquisitions and development transactions. During 2001, we added 2.6 million net rentable square feet to our portfolio by completing an acquisition totaling approximately $755.0 million and completing developments totaling approximately $168.0 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2001, we had construction in progress representing a total anticipated investment of approximately $1.8 billion and a total of approximately 4.9 million net rentable square feet. We are focused on increasing the cash flow from our existing portfolio of properties by maintaining high occupancy levels and increasing effective rents. On the 2.7 million net rentable square feet of second generation space renewed or re leased during the year, new net rents were on average approximately 49.2% higher than the expiring net rents. At December 31 2001, our in service portfolio was 95.3% occupied. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. We receive income primarily from rental revenue from our office, hotel, parking and industrial properties, including reimbursements from certain tenants for certain operating costs. From January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2001, we increased our total portfolio of properties from 121 properties to 147 properties and from 31.6 million net rentable square feet to 40.7 million net rentable square feet. As a result of this rapid growth of our total portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenues and expenses from period to period and we do not believe our period to period financial data are comparable. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 show changes resulting from properties that we owned for each period compared (we refer to this comparison as our "Same Property Portfolio" for the applicable period) and the changes attributable to our total portfolio. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2001 to the year ended December 31, 2000 The table below shows selected operating information for our total portfolio and the 113 buildings acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2000 and that remained in the total portfolio 28 through December 31, 2001 (which constitute the Same Property Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000): Same Property Portfolio Total Portfolio 2001 2000 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2001 2000 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change (Dollars in Thousands) Revenue: Rental $ 892,466 $ 821,695 $ 70,771 8.61 % $ 1,007,610 $ 858,942 $ 148,668 17.31 % Development and management services 13,190 11,837 1,353 11.43 % Interest and other 12,178 8,574 3,604 42.03 % Total revenue 892,466 821,695 70,771 8.61 % 1,032,978 879,353 153,625 17.47 % Expenses: Operating 279,234 255,498 23,736 9.29 % 312,294 264,701 47,593 17.98 % General and administrative 38,312 35,659 2,653 7.44 % Interest 223,389 217,064 6,325 2.91 % Depreciation and amortization 130,998 127,679 3,319 2.60 % 150,163 133,150 17,013 12.78 % Loss on investments in securities 6,500 6,500 Unconsolidated joint venture income 4,186 1,758 2,428 138.11 % Total expenses 410,232 383,177 27,055 7.06 % 734,844 652,332 82,512 12.65 % Income before minority interests and net derivative losses $ 482,234 $ 438,518 $ 43,716 9.97 % $ 298,134 $ 227,021 $ 71,113 31.32 % The increase in rental revenue in our Same Property Portfolio is primarily a result of an overall increase in rental rates on new leases and rollovers, an increase in reimbursable operating expenses as well as an increase in termination fees and early surrender income offset by a decrease in occupancy from year to year. Rental revenue is comprised of base rent, including termination fees and early surrender income, recoveries from tenants and parking and other. Base rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income represents the amount by which straight line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements. Straight line rent for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $28.0 million compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Termination fees and early surrender income increased from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Included in the $21.6 million is $12.4 million related to the early surrender of space of a tenant at 875 Third Avenue, of which approximately $9.2 million has been received to date. We expect to receive the remaining amount on a monthly basis through July 2002. The occupancy for our Same Property Portfolio decreased from 98.9% as of December 31, 2000 to 95.8% as of December 31, 2001. Additional increases in rental revenues in our total portfolio are primarily the result of rental revenues earned on properties we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2000 offset by a decrease in overall occupancy from 98.9% to 95.3%. The Company has not recognized $0.4 million of rental revenue during the year ended December 31, 2001, related to a tenant who has filed for bankruptcy. Although the tenant vacated the space during 2001, the rental payments, to the extent the space is not re let, are guaranteed by a third party. Revenue of approximately $0.2 million per month relating to this space will be recognized, when and if, collection is reasonably assured. The increase in development and management services income in our total portfolio is mainly due to an increase in development and management income earned on contracts starting in 2001 and 2000 and an increase of approximately $0.4 million of work order profits earned on the entire portfolio. This was offset by certain management and development contracts ending in 2000 and some reductions in charges for management fees. 29 The increase in interest and other income in our total portfolio is primarily due to more interest earned as a result of higher average cash balances in 2001 resulting from the remaining proceeds from the public offering in October 2000 offset by lower interest rates. Property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) in our Same Property Portfolio increased mainly due to increases in real estate taxes of $6.0 million, or 2.3%, and increases in utilities of $7.4 million, or 2.9%. Most office leases include reimbursement for these operating expenses. The increase in real estate taxes was primarily due to higher property tax assessments. Small increases in the other property operating expenses account for the remaining difference. Additional increases in property operating expenses in our total portfolio were due to properties we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2000. General and administrative expenses in our total portfolio increased mainly due to an overall increase in payroll due to an increase in the overall size of our total portfolio and the number of employees since January 1, 2000 as well as salary increases to employees. We wrote off $1.4 million of abandoned projects in 2001 compared to a $0.7 million write off in 2000. In addition, the 2001 expense does not include $3.0 million that was included in the prior year related to the departure of two senior employees. Interest expense for our total portfolio increased as a result of having a higher average outstanding debt balance as compared to the prior period. Our debt outstanding at December 31, 2001 was approximately $4.3 billion, compared to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2000. This was partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rates over the year from 7.37% at December 31, 2000 to 6.57% at December 31, 2001. Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $6.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $59.3 million and $37.7 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense discussed above. Depreciation and amortization expense for our Same Property Portfolio increased as a result of capital and tenant improvements made during 2001. Additional increases in depreciation and amortization expense for our total portfolio were mainly due to the properties we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2000 and related capital and tenant improvements. Unconsolidated joint venture income increased as a result of income earned on joint venture properties being placed in service during 2001 and income earned on joint venture properties acquired after January 1, 2000. We account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence, but do not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over 40 years. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2000 to the year ended December 31, 1999 The table below shows selected operating information for our total portfolio and the 106 buildings acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 1999 and that remained in the total portfolio 30 through December 31, 2000 (which constitute the Same Property Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999): Same Property Portfolio Total Portfolio 2000 1999 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2000 1999 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change (Dollars in Thousands) Revenue: Rental $ 766,141 $ 717,654 $ 48,487 6.76 % $ 858,942 $ 765,417 $ 93,525 12.22 % Development and management services 11,837 14,708 (2,871 ) (19.52 )% Interest and other 8,574 6,439 2,135 33.16 % Total revenue 766,141 717,654 48,487 6.76 % 879,353 786,564 92,789 11.80 % Expenses: Operating 237,107 230,178 6,929 3.01 % 264,701 249,268 15,433 6.19 % General and administrative 35,659 29,455 6,204 21.06 % Interest 217,064 205,410 11,654 5.67 % Depreciation and amortization 117,863 112,463 5,400 4.80 % 133,150 120,059 13,091 10.90 % Unconsolidated joint venture income 1,758 468 1,290 275.64 % Total expenses 354,970 342,641 12,329 3.60 % 652,332 604,660 47,672 7.88 % Income before minority interests $ 411,171 $ 375,013 $ 36,158 9.64 % $ 227,021 $ 181,904 $ 45,117 24.80 % The increase in rental revenue in our Same Property Portfolio is primarily a result of an overall increase in rental rates on new leases and rollovers, an increase in reimbursable operating expenses, in addition to an increase in occupancy from year to year and an increase in termination fees from $2.3 million to $3.3 million. Rental revenue is comprised of base rent, including termination fees, recoveries from tenants and parking and other. Base rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Unbilled rents receivable represents the amount by which straight line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements. Straight line rent for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $13.1 million compared to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The occupancy for our Same Property Portfolio increased from 97.4% as of December 31, 1999 to 98.8% as of December 31, 2000. The additional increases in rental revenues in our total portfolio are primarily the result of rental revenues earned on properties we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 1999. The decrease in development and management services income in the total portfolio is mainly due to contracts expiring during 1999 and 2000. The increase in interest and other income in the total portfolio is a result of interest earned on proceeds received from the public offering of our common stock in October 2000 which resulted in higher average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2000. Property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) in our Same Property Portfolio increased mainly due to increases in real estate taxes of $4.0 million, or 4.2%. Most office leases include reimbursement for these operating expenses. Small increases in other property operating expenses account for the balance of the increase. Additional increases in property operating expenses in our total portfolio were mainly due to properties we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 1999 as well as increases in other property related expenses. General and administrative expenses increased due to increases in the overall size of our total portfolio since January 1, 1999. In addition, we incurred a $3.0 million charge related to the departure of two senior employees, which included a non cash charge of approximately $2.0 million. 31 Interest expense for our total portfolio increased due to net increase in mortgage indebtedness and increased amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving line of credit with Fleet National Bank, as agent, from $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $5.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $37.7 million and $17.0 million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense for our Same Property Portfolio increased as a result of capital and tenant improvements made during 2000. Additional increases in depreciation and amortization expense for our total portfolio were due to properties we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2000 and related capital and tenant improvements. Unconsolidated joint venture income increased as a result of income earned on joint venture properties being placed in service during 2000 and income earned on joint venture properties acquired after January 1, 1999. We account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence, but do not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over 40 years. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents were $98.1 million and $281.0 million at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively. The decrease was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows: Year Ended December 31, 2001 2000 $ Change (In Millions) Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 419.4 $ 329.5 $ 89.9 Cash Used for Investing Activities $ (1,303.6 ) $ (563.2 ) $ (740.4 ) Cash Provided by Financing Activities $ 701.3 $ 502.6 $ 198.7 The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the increase in net income resulting from properties acquired and developments that were placed in service after January 1, 2000 and increases in net income from our Same Property Portfolio through 2000 and 2001. Net cash used for investing activities increased from $563.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $1,303.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 mainly due to increased development activity and the acquisition of Citigroup Center during 2001. The net cash used in the 2001 investing activities was primarily for the following transactions: Acquisitions, Dispositions and Development Transactions: On February 13, 2001, the Company acquired a 4.3 acre parcel of land at 77 Fourth Avenue in Waltham, Massachusetts for cash of approximately $13.0 million. This site will support an approximately 202,000 net rentable square foot Class A office building. 32 On March 30, 2001, the Company disposed of 25 33 Dartmouth Street in Westwood, Massachusetts, an industrial building totaling approximately 78,000 net rentable square feet. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $6.6 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $4.7 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $1.1 million). On April 25, 2001, the Company closed on the acquisition of the approximately 1.6 million net rentable square foot office tower in New York City known as Citigroup Center. The acquisition was completed through a venture with a third party private real estate investment company. The total acquisition cost of approximately $755 million, was funded through new mortgage financing totaling $525 million, cash contributed to purchase equity in the acquiring entity of $195 million from Boston Properties Limited Partnership and the balance from the third party private real estate investment company. Our $195 million equity investment will earn a preferential return of 10% per annum. The preferred equity and any accumulated unpaid portion of the priority return on our equity investment will be payable before the third party affiliate receive a return on its common interest. Based on our current forecasts for the property, we expect to receive 100% of the cash flow after debt service for the 10 years following the acquisition. Financial results of the venture are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company controls the entity that owns the property. On June 29, 2001, the Company disposed of Maryland Industrial Park, Buildings Two and Three, consisting of two industrial buildings totaling approximately 183,945 square feet, for net proceeds of approximately $7.6 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $1.9 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.4 million). On November 8, 2001, the Company disposed of a parcel of land known as the Belvedere Condominium/Retail Project located at the Prudential Center in Boston, Massachusetts for net proceeds of approximately $11 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $2.3 million (net of minority interest of approximately $0.5 million.) On November 29, 2001, the Company acquired an approximately 22 acre parcel of land in Reston, Virginia for cash of approximately $8.6 million. This site will support an approximately 358,000 net rentable square foot Class A office building. On December 19, 2001, the Company acquired a 74 acre parcel of land in Weston, Massachusetts for cash of approximately $18 million, which includes a deposit made in 2000 of approximately $9 million. This site will support an approximately 350,000 net rentable square foot Class A office building. 33 We placed seven Class A office buildings in service, which required a total investment during 2001 of approximately $51.6 million. We began or continued construction on an additional twelve office buildings and incurred approximately $631.1 million of construction costs during 2001. Our properties under construction as of December 31, 2001 were as follows: Properties Under Construction Location Initial Occupancy Stabilization Date # of Buildings Square feet Investment to Date Anticipated Total Investment(1)(2) Percent Leased Times Square Tower New York, NY Q4 2003 Q2 2004 1 1,218,511 $ 250,692,311 $ 653,500,000 51 %(3) 5 Times Square New York, NY Q1 2002 Q2 2002 1 1,099,154 418,364,009 536,115,000 100 % 111 Huntington Avenue Prudential Center Boston, MA Q3 2001 Q4 2002 1 859,484 276,916,812 290,000,000 95 % 111 Huntington Avenue retail Boston, MA Q3 2001 Q3 2002 93,789 n/a n/a 61 % Waltham Weston Corporate Center Waltham, MA Q1 2002 Q4 2003 1 304,051 56,510,296 95,446,000 19 % 611 Gateway Boulevard S.

In total, our existing construction loans have $657.0 million remaining to be drawn out of a total $1.5 billion. Of the remaining commitment of $672.3 million on our construction projects, $657.0 of the costs will be covered under our existing construction loans. In addition, we expect to close an additional construction loan relating to the Shaws Supermarket project of $24.0 million in the first quarter of 2002. Cash provided by financing activities increased by $198.7 million for the year ended 2001 to $701.3 million from $502.6 million for the year ended 2000. During 2001, we received proceeds from new debt totaling approximately $1.1 billion. This was offset by $229.0 million of paydowns and principal payments and $276.5 million of dividend and distribution payments during 2001. Capitalization At December 31, 2001, our total consolidated debt was approximately $4.3 billion. The weighted average rate of our consolidated indebtedness was 6.57% and the weighted average maturity was approximately 5.7 years. Our total market capitalization was approximately $9.1 billion at December 31, 2001. Total market capitalization was calculated using the December 31, 2001 closing stock price of $38.0 per share and includes the following: (1) 90,780,591 shares of our common stock, (2) 20,212,776 of common units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 11,010,839 common units issuable upon conversion of all Series One, Two, Three and Z preferred units, (4) 2,624,672 shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of all 2,000,000 shares of our Series A preferred stock, and (5) our consolidated debt. Our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2001 represented approximately 47.7% of our total market capitalization. 34  Debt Financing The table below summarizes our mortgage notes and bonds payable and our revolving line of credit with Fleet Boston, as agent at December 31, 2001 and 2000: December 31, 2001 2000 (Dollars in Thousands) DEBT SUMMARY: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,448,903 $ 3,010,760 Variable rate 866,039 404,131 Total $ 4,314,942 $ 3,414,891 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 79.93 % 88.17 % Variable rate 20.07 % 11.83 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate: Fixed rate 7.27 % 7.21 % Variable rate 3.77 % 8.56 % Total 6.57 % 7.37 % The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or Eurodollar rates. We utilize our $605.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit principally to fund development of properties, other land and property acquisitions and for working capital purposes. Our unsecured revolving line of credit is a recourse obligation of Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Outstanding balances under the unsecured revolving line of credit currently bear interest at a floating rate based on an increase over Eurodollar from 105 to 170 basis points or an increase over the lenders prime rate from zero to 75 basis points, depending upon our applicable leverage ratio. Our ability to borrow under our unsecured revolving line of credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: (1) loan to value ratio against our total borrowing base not to exceed 55%, unless our leverage ratio exceeds 60%, in which case it is not to exceed 50%, (2) a loan to value ratio against the total secured borrowing base not to exceed 55%, (3) debt service coverage ratio of 1.40 for our borrowing base, or 1.50 if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds 60%, and 1.30 for us as a whole for full fixed charges, (4) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however five consecutive quarters (not including the two quarters prior to expiration) can go to 65%, (5) limitations on additional indebtedness and stockholder distributions, and (6) a minimum net worth requirement. At December 31, 2001, we had issued letters of credit totaling $3.5 million secured by our unsecured line of credit and had the ability to borrow an additional $601.5 million under our unsecured revolving line of credit. As of February 28, 2002, there were no amounts outstanding under our unsecured revolving line of credit. 35 The following table sets forth certain information regarding our mortgage notes and bonds payable at December 31, 2001: Properties Interest Rate Principal Amount Maturity Date (In Thousands) Citigroup Center 7.19 % $ 522,044 May 11, 2011 Embarcadero Center One, Two and Federal Reserve 6.70 % 308,940 December 12, 2008 5 Times Square(1) 3.93 % 289,179 January 26, 2003 Prudential Center 6.72 % 288,116 July 1, 2008 280 Park Avenue 7.64 % 267,789 February 1, 2011 599 Lexington Avenue(2) 7.00 % 225,000 July 19, 2005 111 Huntington Avenue(3) 3.65 % 184,307 September 27, 2002 Embarcadero Center Four 6.79 % 151,638 February 1, 2008 875 Third Avenue(4) 8.00 % 148,796 January 1, 2003 Times Square Tower(5) 3.88 % 145,472 November 29, 2004 Embarcadero Center Three 6.40 % 144,360 January 1, 2007 Two Independence Square(6) 8.09 % 115,093 February 27, 2003 Riverfront Plaza 6.61 % 113,250 February 1, 2008 Democracy Center 7.05 % 106,002 April 1, 2009 Embarcadero Center West Tower 6.50 % 96,307 January 1, 2006 100 East Pratt Street 6.73 % 90,375 November 1, 2008 601 and 651 Gateway Boulevard 8.40 % 89,184 October 1, 2010 One Independence Square(7) 3.52 % 75,000 August 20, 2003 Reservoir Place(8) 6.88 % 71,935 November 1, 2006 One & Two Reston Overlook 7.45 % 67,485 September 1, 2004 2300 N Street 6.88 % 66,000 August 3, 2003 202, 206, 214 Carnegie Center 8.13 % 62,397 October 1, 2010 New Dominion Technology Park, Building 1 7.70 % 57,610 January 15, 2021 Capital Gallery 8.24 % 56,064 August 15, 2006 504, 506, 508 Carnegie Center 7.39 % 47,459 January 1, 2008 Waltham Weston Corporate Center(9) 3.63 % 46,446 February 13, 2004 10 and 20 Burlington Mall Road(10) 7.25 % 39,857 October 1, 2011 10 Cambridge Center 8.27 % 35,226 May 1, 2010 1301 New York Avenue (11 ) 31,669 August 15, 2009 Sumner Square 7.35 % 30,183 September 1, 2013 Eight Cambridge Center 7.73 % 27,988 July 15, 2010 2600 Tower Oaks Boulevard(12) 3.84 % 27,318 September 20, 2002 Quorum Office Park(13) 3.58 % 27,295 August 25, 2003 510 Carnegie Center 7.39 % 27,178 January 1, 2008 Lockheed Martin Building 6.61 % 25,759 June 1, 2008 Orbital Sciences Buildings One and Three(14) 3.58 % 25,644 August 9, 2002 University Place 6.94 % 24,679 August 1, 2021 Reston Corporate Center 6.56 % 24,303 May 1, 2008 Orbital Sciences Building Two(15) 3.55 % 23,587 June 13, 2003 191 Spring Street 8.50 % 22,480 September 1, 2006 Bedford Business Park 8.50 % 21,178 December 10, 2008 NIMA Building 6.51 % 21,056 June 1, 2008 40 Shattuck Road(16) 3.68 % 14,822 October 21, 2003 101 Carnegie Center 7.66 % 8,047 April 1, 2006 Montvale Center 8.59 % 7,418 December 1, 2006 302 Carnegie Center(17) 3.73 % 6,969 April 1, 2003 Hilltop Business Center 6.81 % 5,588 March 1, 2019 201 Carnegie Center 7.08 % 450 February 1, 2010 Total $ 4,314,942 (1)Total construction loan in the amount of $420.0 million at a variable rate of Eurodollar + 2.00%.

Joint Ventures We have investments in eight unconsolidated joint ventures with ownership ranging from 25 51%. We do not have control of these partnerships, and therefore, they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2001, our share of the debt related to these investments is equal to approximately $216.2 million. The table below summarizes the outstanding debt relative to our investment in these joint venture properties at December 31, 2001: Properties Interest Rate Principal Amount Maturity Date Metropolitan Square (51%) 8.23 % $ 70,476 May 1, 2010 Market Square North (50%) 7.70 % 49,373 December 19, 2011 Discovery Square (50%) 3.60 % 23,048 December 8, 2003 Two Freedom Square (50%) 3.74 % 21,058 June 29, 2004 One Freedom Square (25%) 7.75 % 19,130 June 30, 2012 265 Franklin Street (35%) 3.41 % 18,900 October 1, 2002 140 Kendrick Street (25%) 7.51 % 14,197 July 1, 2013 Total 6.67 % $ 216,182 Stock Repurchase On September 14, 2001, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program under which we are permitted to purchase up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. From that date 37 through February 28, 2002, we purchased 78,900 shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $2.7 million. As a result, we have authorization to repurchase up to an additional $97.3 million of our outstanding common stock, which we may repurchase from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or through privately negotiated transactions, depending on market prices and other conditions. The authority granted by the Board of Directors may, in the discretion of our senior management, be exercised form time to time and in such amounts as market conditions warrant. General We have determined that our estimated cash flows and available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet liquidity needs for the next twelve months. We believe that our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to fund normal recurring expenses, debt service requirements, current development costs not covered under construction loans and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe that these needs will be fully funded from cash flows provided by operating and financing activities. We expect to meet liquidity requirements for periods beyond twelve months for the costs of development, property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non recurring capital improvements through construction loans, the incurrence of long term secured and unsecured indebtedness, income from operations and sales of real estate and possibly the issuance of additional common and preferred units of Boston Properties Limited Partnership and equity securities of Boston Properties, Inc. In addition, we may finance the development, redevelopment or acquisition of additional properties by using our unsecured revolving line of credit. Rental revenues, operating expense reimbursement income from tenants, and income from the operations are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service and recurring capital expenditures. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue include third party fees generated by our office and industrial real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for operating expenses, debt service and recurring capital expenditures. Based on leases in place at December 31, 2001, leases with respect to 4.1% of our Class A office buildings will expire in calendar year 2002. Although we are unable to estimate the actual rate of future leases, we believe that the expiring leases may be renewed, or space re let, at higher or the same rents than previously in effect. While we are working to retain our current tenants in situations that are beneficial to us, conditions over the past year, including more sublet space available and decreasing rental rates across the board, make it difficult for us to predict what future changes may be and how they will effect our re leasing efforts. The aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks has resulted in higher operating costs for many of our properties due to heightened security measures. At this time we are not able to predict whether these increased costs will abate over time, or whether we will continue to be able to pass them through to our tenants. These and other long term effects on our business of the September 11, 2001 events are unknown at this time, but could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we paid or declared quarterly dividends totaling $2.27 per common share (consisting of $.53 related to the quarter ended March 31, 2001 and $.58 related to each of the quarters ended June 30, 2001, September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2001). We intend to continue paying dividends quarterly. 38 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our long term indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair value of our long term debt obligation is affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long term leases with long term fixed rate non recourse debt of similar duration. In addition, we maintain a major unencumbered portion of our portfolio. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of pre leasing development projects on a long term basis to strong tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 80% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk until the maturity of such outstanding debt. We have entered into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objective when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure, which, in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy protects us against future increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2001, we had hedge contracts totaling $150 million. The hedging agreements provide for a fixed interest rate when LIBOR is less than 5.80% and when LIBOR is between 6.70% and 9.00% for terms ranging from three to five years per the individual hedging agreements. We will consider entering into additional hedging agreements with respect to all or a portion of our variable rate debt. We may borrow additional money with variable rates in the future. Increases in interest rates could increase interest expense, which in turn could affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt. As a result of the hedging agreements, decreases in interest rates could increase interest expense as compared to the underlying variable rate debt and could result in us making payments to unwind such agreements. During 2001, we paid the fair value of a swap arrangement and two hedge contracts that were in place during 2000 and part of 2001 in order to terminate the contracts. At December 31, 2001, our variable rate debt outstanding was approximately $866.0 million. At December 31, 2001, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 3.77%. Taking the hedging contracts into consideration, if market interest rates on our variable rate debt were to increase by ten percent (approximately 38 basis points), total interest would increase approximately $2.7 million. At December 31, 2000, our variable rate debt outstanding was approximately $404.1 million. At December 31, 2000, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 8.56%. Taking the hedging contracts into consideration, if market interest rates on our variable rate debt were to increase by ten percent (approximately 86 basis points), total interest would increase approximately $1.7 million. These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. Funds from Operations Pursuant to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts revised definition of Funds from Operations, we calculate Funds From Operations by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, including non recurring items), for gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and sales of properties (except gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties), real estate related depreciation and amortization and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We consider Funds from Operations, after supplemental adjustments, one measure of REIT performance. We believe that Funds From 39 Operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flow from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs. We compute Funds From Operations in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts which may not be comparable to Funds From Operations reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts definition or that interpret the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts definition differently. In addition to Funds from Operations (as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts), we also disclose Funds from Operations after certain supplemental adjustments. Funds From Operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Our funds from operations for the respective periods is calculated as follows: The Company The Predecessor Group Year Ended December 31, Period From June 23, 1997 to December 31, 1997 Period From January 1, 1997 to June 22, 1997 2001 2000 1999 1998 (In Thousands) Income before minority interests and unconsilidated joint venture income $ 302,320 $ 228,779 $ 182,372 $ 140,575 $ 38,878 $ 4,840 Add: Real estate depreciation and amortization 153,550 134,386 119,583 74,649 21,417 16,808 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 4,186 1,758 468 Less: Net derivative losses (26,488 ) Minority property partnerships share of funds from operations (2,322 ) (1,061 ) (3,681 ) (4,185 ) (287 ) (198 ) Preferred dividends and distributions (33,312 ) (32,994 ) (32,111 ) (5,830 ) Funds from operations 397,934 330,868 266,631 205,209 60,008 21,450 Add (subtract): Net derivative losses(1) 26,488 Early surrender lease adjustment(2) (8,518 ) Funds from operations before net derivative losses and after early surrender lease adjustment $ 415,904 $ 330,868 $ 266,631 $ 205,209 $ 60,008 $ 21,450 Funds from operations available to common stockholders before net derivative losses and after early surrender lease adjustment $ 337,823 $ 247,371 $ 196,101 $ 153,045 $ 42,258 Weighted average shares outstanding basic 90,002 71,424 66,235 60,776 38,694 (1)Expense recognized for adjustment to fair value related to SFAS 133.

These pre purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties which we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time pre existing environmental conditions at our properties have required environmental testing and or regulatory filings. In February 1999, one of our affiliates acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We recently completed development of an office park on the property. Our affiliate engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Pursuant to the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed 41  to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify our affiliate for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses. Environmental investigations at two of our properties in Massachusetts have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off site source properties. In both cases we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments and to prepare submittals to the state regulatory authority, including Downgradient Property Status Opinions. These Opinions concluded that the properties qualify for Downgradient Property Status under the state regulatory program, which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory amendments regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may ultimately be responsible for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). No such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. One of our affiliates recently acquired a property in Massachusetts where historic groundwater contamination was identified prior to acquisition. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to perform investigations and to prepare necessary submittals to the state regulatory authority. The environmental consultant has concluded that (1) certain identified groundwater contaminants are migrating to the subject property from an off site source property and (2) certain other detected contaminants are likely related to a historic release on the subject property. The consultant has recommended filing a Downgradient Property Status Opinion (described above) with respect to contamination migrating from off site and conducting additional investigations, including the installation of off site monitoring wells, to determine the nature and extent of contamination potentially associated with the historic use of the subject property. Our affiliate has authorized such additional investigations and will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and or groundwater handling procedures in connection with construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision making process with respect to the acquisition and or development of the property. For example, we recently acquired a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We anticipate that this contamination will be addressed in concert with future construction activities. When appropriate, we expect to file a plan detailing such activities with the state regulatory authority and to submit it for public review and comment pursuant to the state regulatory authoritys public information process. We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Newly Issued Accounting Standards On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The provisions of SFAS 42 No. 141 apply to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 becomes effective beginning January 1, 2002. We do not anticipate that these standards will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long Lived Assets" which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets. This standard harmonizes the accounting for impaired assets and resolves some of the implementation issues as originally described in SFAS No. 121. The new standard becomes effective for the year ending December 31, 2002. We do not expect this pronouncement to have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations. Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases described above. 43  Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Approximately $3.4 billion of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. The following table presents principal cash flows based upon maturity dates of the debt obligations and the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed rate debt. The interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2001 ranged from LIBOR or Eurodollar plus 1.60% to LIBOR or Eurodollar plus 2.00%.
