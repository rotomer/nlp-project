Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. 31 Forward Looking Statements This Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions "Business and Growth Strategies," "Risk Factors" and "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." We caution investors that any forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on managements beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words "anticipate," "believe," expect," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "estimate," "project," "should," "will," "result" and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include, among others, the following: general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments; failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets or to integrate acquisitions successfully; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for 32 future periods and current reports on Form 8 K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8 K or otherwise. Critical Accounting Policies The SEC published cautionary advice in December 2001 regarding MD&A disclosure of critical accounting policies. The significant accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 of our financial statements. These critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties, which affect the application of these policies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. The material accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations that require significant management estimates and judgments are discussed below. Real Estate Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements include the purchase price of property, legal fees and acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. We periodically review our properties to determine if our carrying amounts will be recovered from future operating cash flows. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements which could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be "long lived assets to be held and used" as defined by FAS 144 are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale or disposal date, an impairment loss may be recognized. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of our properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgement. Our capitalization policy on our development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 "Capitalization of Interest Cost" and SFAS No. 67 "Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Properties", and ceases capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity. In the third quarter of 2002, we substantially completed construction of the base building at 611 Gateway in South San Francisco. Although substantial construction remained which would allow continued capitalization until the earlier of completion of tenant build out or one year, and since we have no leasing prospects and do not expect to lease the property within the next year, the building was placed in service during the third quarter of 2002. Accordingly, since July 2002 all costs are being expensed as incurred. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures We account for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence, but do not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over 40 years. Under the equity 33 method of accounting, the net equity investment is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included on our consolidated statements of operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among the investors for profits and losses, however our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. We serve as the development manager for the joint ventures currently under development. The profit on development fees received from joint ventures is recognized to the extent attributable to the outside interests in the joint ventures, in addition to internal costs. Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases. Accrued rental income represents rental income earned in excess of rent payments received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. We maintain an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential tenant credit losses. The credit assessment is based on the estimated accrued rental income that is recoverable over the term of the lease. We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent payments. The computation of this allowance is based on the tenants payment history and current credit status, as well as certain industry or geographic specific credit considerations. If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in place tenant leases was approximately 7.2 years as of December 31, 2002. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our tenant base, review of the tenants risk profile prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Property operating cost reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs are recognized in the period that expenses are incurred. Development fees are recognized ratably over the period of development, as earned. Management fees are recognized as revenue as they are earned. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66 "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate." The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation We compute depreciation on our properties using the straight line method based on an estimated useful life of 40 years. The portion of the acquisition cost allocated between land and building each property may vary based on estimated land value and other factors. The allocation of the acquisition cost to building and the determination of the useful life are based on managements estimates of the composite life of the building. Fair Value of Financial Instruments On a quarterly basis, we calculated the fair value of our mortgage debt and unsecured notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. In addition, we are also required to adjust the carrying values of our derivative contracts on a quarterly basis to its fair value. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not turn out to be accurate. 34 Overview Notwithstanding a decrease in tenant demand and higher reported vacancy rates, which have been impacted by stagnant job growth and the substantial supply of sub lease space brought back to market due to overzealous expectations of economic growth which did not materialize, we produced a solid operating performance in 2002, increasing diluted earnings per share, excluding gains on sales of properties, by 13.8% on year to year basis. Highlights of the 2002 operating performance include: completion of major new development projects at 5 Times Square Tower and 111 Huntington Avenue; acquisition of 399 Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan; opportunistic sale of premier assets in Washington, D.C.; and enhancement of capital structure thorough the placement of $750 million investment grade ten year 6.25% notes due 2013. During 2002, we added 4.5 million net rentable square feet to our portfolio by completing an acquisition totaling approximately $1.06 billion and completing developments totaling approximately $924.0 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, we had construction in progress representing a total anticipated investment of approximately $924.0 million and a total of approximately 2.8 million net rentable square feet. Also in 2002, we sold seven properties and other real estate totaling 1.5 million net rentable square feet. We received gross proceeds from the sale of this real estate of approximately $428.0 million. On the 2.7 million net rentable square feet of second generation space renewed or re leased during the year, new net rents were on average approximately 6.8% higher than the expiring net rents. At December 31, 2002, our in service portfolio was 93.9% occupied. The difficulties and uncertainties characterizing the economy since 2001 still prevail and there is no sign yet of the job growth necessary for increasing office space demand. It is worth noting that, in this real estate cycle, previous over commitments to space by tenants, particularly among technology companies, had an unprecedented role in subsequently rising vacancy rates while excessive speculative construction played a much lesser role, and that the market responded quickly to declining demand with a halt in almost all new construction. While this bodes well for the future, we do not foresee a significant improvement in the market in 2003. Decreased tenant activity makes it unlikely that occupancy rates will increase this year, and since there will be no shortage of opportunities for tenants, increases in market rents are unlikely, with further declines possible. As a consequence we expect little or no growth in 2003 in the income generated within our portfolio. One of our focuses for 2003 is completing the leasing of three development projects recently put into service or still under construction. Two suburban projects with 555,000 net rentable square feet in total and base building construction completed, Waltham Weston Corporate Center in Waltham, Massachusetts, and 611 Gateway Center in south San Francisco, California, are impacted by low market demand and will not achieve stabilization for several years. The third project is Times Square Tower, a 47 story, 1.2 million net rentable square foot building currently under construction in New York City at the heart of Times Square. Arthur Andersen had originally been secured as lead tenant for this property, which is now being actively re marketed after the termination of the Andersen lease in the wake of that firms demise last year. A 207,000 square foot lease with a major law firm was signed in January 2003, and we are very encouraged by the considerable additional active tenant interest in this property, but with initial occupancy not scheduled until 2004, Times Square Tower will of course not contribute to 2003 earnings. Our successful issuance of unsecured long term debt, while beneficial overall in obtaining long term fixed rate investment grade debt, will negatively affect earnings for 2003 compared to last year. This fixed rate debt replaced floating rate construction financing in place during 2002 to fund development projects and part of the floating rate bridge financing that initially funded the acquisition 35 of 399 Park Avenue. Thus our debt in 2003, by the nature of the yield curve, will be at measurably higher interest rates. This matching of long term fixed rate financing to the long term duration of our leases represents an appropriately prudent financial structure, but the impact will be some reduction in comparable net income. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. As of July 1, 2002, we reported the gross operating revenues and expenses associated with our ownership of the hotels by our TRS on a consolidated basis, whereas in the past, we only reported net lease payments and real estate taxes. The reporting of the hotel operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 is not directly comparable to the same period in 2001 and therefore the hotel operating expenses have been netted against hotel revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 (otherwise entitled "Hotel Net Operating Income") to provide a basis of comparison to prior periods. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, we owned 142 properties and 147 properties, respectively (we refer to all of the properties that we own as our "Total Portfolio"). Our property operations, including property management, development and leasing are regionally aligned with the objective of becoming the dominant landlord in our core markets. Management reviews operating and financial data for each property separately and independently from all other properties. Major decisions regarding the allocation of financing, investing, information technology and capital allocation are made in conjunction with the input of senior management located in our corporate headquarters. As a result of changes in 2002 within our Total Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenues and expenses from period to period. We do not believe our period to period financial data are comparable. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 show changes resulting from properties that we owned for each period compared (we refer to this comparison as our "Same Property Portfolio" for the applicable period) and the changes attributable to our Total Portfolio. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2001 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 119 properties, including three hotels and five properties in which we have a joint venture interest, acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2001 and owned by us through December 31, 2002. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in service or acquired after January 1, 2001 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2002. Our net property operating margins, which are defined as rental 36 revenues less operating expenses exclusive of the three hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2002, have ranged between 67% and 70%.

These increased revenue by $194.5 million. This increase was offset by dispositions of properties throughout 2002 and a decrease in occupancy rates from 95.3% at December 31, 2001 to 93.9% at December 31, 2002. Properties sold during 2002 included One and Two Independence Square, 2391 West Winton Avenue, Fullerton Square, and 7600, 7700 and 7702 Boston Boulevard. 37  Termination Income The termination income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily related to three tenants in San Francisco who terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately $4.0 million. This compared to termination income received in the prior year related to the early surrender of space of one tenant in New York representing $12.4 million. Development and Management Services The decrease in development and management income of $1.4 million primarily resulted from the completion of projects during 2001, including certain third party contracts as well as certain of our joint venture projects. This decrease was offset by development fees earned on a new joint venture project which was started in 2002 as well as an increase in management fees relating to certain of our joint ventures which were placed into service in 2002. Interest and Other The decrease in interest and other expenses related to the Total Portfolio is a result of less interest earned due to lower average cash balances maintained and lower interest rates on cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the higher average cash balance was attributable to unused proceeds from our public offering of common stock in October 2000. Operating Expenses Property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) in the Same Property Portfolio increased during the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily due to increases in real estate taxes of $5.2 million, or 5.0%, and increases in insurance of $4.1 million, or 70.6%. The increase in real estate taxes was primarily due to higher property tax assessments. Small increases in the other property operating expenses account for the remaining difference. Additional increases in property operating expenses in the Total Property Portfolio were primarily due to the additions of the Citigroup Center, Five Times Square, 399 Park Avenue and 111 Huntington Avenue properties and other properties that we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2001. Increases in insurance in the Same Property Portfolio and Total Portfolio are related to increases in rates on existing coverage and the purchase of a separate stand alone terrorism policy. The office leases include reimbursements from tenants for a portion of these operating expenses. The increases were offset by decreases related to properties that were sold during 2002. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties decreased by $3.5 million or approximately 13.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. Average occupancy and Revenue per Available Room ("REVPAR") for the hotel properties were 80.7% and $146.25, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to 80.5% and $158.50, respectively for the prior year. This is related to the general downturn in the economy as well as lasting effects of September 11, 2001. Other Expenses General and administrative expenses in the Total Portfolio increased during the year ended December 31, 2002 by $9.0 million, of which $2.8 million related to the write off in the second quarter of non recoverable commissions related to the termination of the lease with Arthur Andersen LLP for 620,947 square feet at the Times Square Tower development project. The remaining increase related 38 primarily to increases in compensation and related expenses, specifically an increase of $3.3 million to bonuses awarded to senior management for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, a $1.4 million increase related to a decrease in capitalized wages resulting from decreased development activity in 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, and a $0.5 million increase in costs incurred related to implementing the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. In 2003, we transitioned to using solely restricted stock units, as opposed to stock options and restricted stock, awarded under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on January 24, 2000, as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards over a five year term. Restricted stock and restricted stock units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the price of our common stock on the date of grant as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. To the extent restricted stock or restricted stock units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to "Stock based compensation." Stock based compensation associated with restricted stock units was $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $6.1 million of restricted stock units which were granted in January 2003 will be incurred as such restricted stock units vest in years 2006 through 2008. Interest expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of having a higher average outstanding debt balance as compared to the prior period as well as decreased interest capitalization. This was primarily due to placing into service and cessation of interest capitalization on Five Times Square, 111 Huntington Avenue, and 611 Gateway and new debt incurred related to the acquisition of Citigroup Center and 399 Park Avenue. Our total debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 was approximately $5.1 billion, compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2001. This was partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rates over the year from 6.57% at December 31, 2001 to 6.03% at December 31, 2002. Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $5.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $22.5 million and $59.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of the additions of the Citigroup Center, Five Times Square, 111 Huntington Avenue and 399 Park Avenue properties and other properties that we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2001. The increases were offset by decreases related to properties that were sold during 2002. Net derivative losses for the Total Portfolio represent the mark to market of our derivative contracts and payments that were not effective for accounting purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized a reduction in the fair value of our contracts as a result of generally low interest rates. The fair value of our derivative contracts is included on our balance sheet at December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized losses on our investments in securities of approximately $4.3 million. This loss was related to the write off of our investment in the securities of a technology company due to the Companys determination that the decline in the fair value of these securities was an other than temporary decline. The loss on investment of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 was related to the write off of investments in securities of two technology companies. 39 Joint Ventures Income from unconsolidated joint ventures for the Same Property Portfolio increased by $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary result of the increase is related to the completion of the repositioning of 265 Franklin Street during 2001 as well as receiving preferential returns on certain other joint ventures resulting from the achievement of specified investment return thresholds. The additional increase in the total portfolio is related to the placing in service of One and Two Discovery Square. Other Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to the sale of One and Two Independence Square were not included in discontinued operations, as we have continuing involvement through a third party management agreement. The decrease in income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 was a result of the properties classified as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS 144 being sold prior to December 31, 2002, and therefore, we did not recognize a full year of revenues and expenses as we did in the prior year. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to the gain recognized on the properties that were sold. These properties included Fullerton Square, 2391 West Winton and 7600, 7700 and 7702 Boston Boulevard. The extraordinary item for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to a debt extinguishment charge we incurred in connection with the prepayment of debt in connection with the sale of our properties. The decrease in our preferred dividend from $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 was a result of the conversion of 2,000,000 shares of our preferred stock into common stock in July 2002. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2001 to the year ended December 31, 2000 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 115 properties, including three hotels and one property which we own a joint venture interest, acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2001 and owned by us through December 31, 2002.

Rental revenue is comprised of base rent, including termination fees, recoveries from tenants and parking and other. Base rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income represents the amount by which straight line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with the lease agreements. Straight line rent for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $28.0 million compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Termination fees and early surrender income increased from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Included in the $21.6 million is $12.4 million related to the early surrender of space of a tenant at 875 Third Avenue, 41 of which approximately $9.2 million has been received to date. We received the remaining amount on a monthly basis through July 2002. The occupancy for our Same Property Portfolio decreased from 98.9% as of December 31, 2000 to 95.8% as of December 31, 2001. Additional increases in rental revenues in our total portfolio are primarily the result of rental revenues earned on properties we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2000 offset by a decrease in overall occupancy from 98.9% to 95.3%. The increase in development and management services income in our total portfolio is mainly due to income earned on contracts starting in 2001 and 2000 and an increase of approximately $0.4 million of work order profits earned on the entire portfolio. This was offset by certain management and development contracts ending in 2000 and some reductions in charges for management fees. The increase in interest and other income in our total portfolio is primarily due to more interest earned as a result of higher average cash balances in 2001 resulting from the remaining proceeds from the public offering in October 2000 offset by lower interest rates. Operating Expenses Property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) in our Same Property Portfolio increased mainly due to increases in real estate taxes of $6.0 million, or 2.3%, and increases in utilities of $7.4 million, or 2.9%. Most office leases include reimbursement for these operating expenses. The increase in real estate taxes was primarily due to higher property tax assessments. Small increases in the other property operating expenses account for the remaining difference. Additional increases in property operating expenses in our total portfolio were due to properties we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2000. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties decreased $2.4 million, or approximately 8.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to December 31, 2000. Average occupancy and Revenue per Available Room ("REVPAR") for the hotel properties were 80.5% and $158.5, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to 88.4% and $195.59, respectively, for the prior year. This was a result of a general downturn in the market as well as the events of September 11, 2001. Other Expenses General and administrative expenses in our Total Portfolio increased mainly due to an overall increase in payroll due to an increase in the overall size of our Total Portfolio and the number of employees since January 1, 2000 as well as salary increases to employees. We wrote off $1.4 million of abandoned projects in 2001 compared to a $0.7 million write off in 2000. In addition, the 2001 expense does not include $3.0 million that was included in the prior year related to the departure of two senior employees. Interest expense for our Total Portfolio increased as a result of having a higher average outstanding debt balance as compared to the prior period. Our debt outstanding at December 31, 2001 was approximately $4.3 billion, compared to $3.4 billion at December 31, 2000. This was partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rates over the year from 7.37% at December 31, 2000 to 6.57% at December 31, 2001. Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $6.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $59.3 million and $37.7 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense discussed above. 42 Depreciation and amortization expense for our Same Property Portfolio increased as a result of capital and tenant improvements made during 2001. Additional increases in depreciation and amortization expense for our total portfolio were mainly due to the properties we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2000 and related capital and tenant improvements. The net derivative losses incurred during 2001 result from the adoption of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 ("FAS 133") "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" as well as the mark to market of the derivatives subsequent to adoption. The loss on investments in securities during 2001 resulted from the write down of investments in the securities of two publicly traded telecommunications companies. The Company determined that the decline in the fair value of these securities was other than temporary. Joint Ventures Unconsolidated joint venture income increased as a result of income earned on joint venture properties being placed in service during 2001 and income earned on joint venture properties acquired after January 1, 2000. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in "
