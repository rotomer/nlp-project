Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward Looking Statements This Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on managements beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, might, plan, estimate, project, should, will, result and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include, among others, the following: general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments; failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets or to integrate acquisitions successfully; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); 34 Table of Contents risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8 K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8 K or otherwise. Overview We are a fully integrated self administered and self managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in four core markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, costs of tenant improvements, operating costs and real estate taxes, vacancy and general economic factors. Our industrys performance is generally predicated on a sustained pattern of job growth. In 2003, while the overall United States economy began to demonstrate sustained overall economic growth, there were few indications that the economy was creating jobs at a pace sufficient to lead to increased demand for our office space. We continued to operate in a period of weak fundamentals, evidenced by relatively high vacancy and correspondingly lower market rents. Our corporate strategy of owning high quality office buildings concentrated in strong, supply constrained markets and emphasizing long term leases to creditworthy tenants lessened the overall impact of the weak fundamentals in the operating environment by limiting our lease expiration exposure both from natural lease expirations and from terminations due to tenant defaults. This ameliorated the potential decline in gross revenues even as we renewed or re let space at lower rents and enabled us to experience only a very slight decline in our portfolio occupancy. In the face of these challenging market conditions, we have followed a disciplined approach to managing our operations by focusing primarily on enhancing the value of our existing portfolio through strategic sales and successful leasing efforts and by solidifying our capital structure through the refinancing of a significant portion of our variable rate debt with long term fixed rate. At the same time, we continued to selectively pursue new acquisition and development opportunities. The highlights of our 2003 activity reflect this strategy. We sold three real estate assets for gross sales prices totaling $555 million. We also leveraged our strong relationships to acquire $298 million of interests in real estate assets in the Washington, D.C. area. We completed the construction and lease up of two development projects, the 422,000 square foot Two Freedom Square building in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Reston, Virginia and the 57,000 square foot 35 Table of Contents Shaws supermarket at the Prudential Center in Boston. These buildings were 100% leased upon completion. We have three remaining development projects: New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two; Times Square Tower; and 901 New York Avenue. New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two is a 257,400 square foot building located in the Washington D.C. suburb of Herndon, VA and that is 100% leased to the General Services Administration. Times Square Tower is a 47 story building with 1.2 million net rentable square feet. Times Square Tower, a portion of which will be placed into service in the spring of 2004, is currently approximately 35% leased. This building was originally 60% pre leased to Arthur Andersen, but that lease was terminated in the wake of that firms demise. 901 New York Avenue is a 538,500 square foot building located in Washington, D.C. in which we have a 25% interest. This building is 80% leased as of December 31, 2003. We did not commence construction on any new office developments in 2003 although during the year we purchased land and formed joint ventures with land owners that will offer the opportunity to commence development in 2004 or beyond. The strength of our portfolio supplemented with the acquisitions and new developments that were brought on line in 2003 allowed us to increase our total revenue by 10.5% in 2003. We refinanced $725 million of variable rate debt with unsecured fixed rate debt at an average interest rate of 5.60% with maturities ranging from 10 to 12 years. We also entered into amended loan agreements with existing lenders on $150.6 million of debt during the year. At the end of 2003, our fixed rate debt represents 91.2% of our total outstanding debt. Our variable rate debt at the end of 2003 consisted of our two construction facilities associated with our two remaining development projects and our unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe that the matching of our long term fixed rate debt financing with the long duration of our leases represents an appropriately prudent financial structure, but this has come with the short term cost of greater interest expense than we would have incurred with variable rate debt financing. We are optimistic that market conditions will not deteriorate further. However, without strong job growth in our markets, we do not expect to see significant improvement in occupancy or rental rates during 2004. We are well positioned to weather a continuation of the current operating environment and prosper when sustained job growth resumes. If such job growth is accompanied by a rising interest rate environment, we will have a financial platform that will enable us to realize the benefits of our long term fixed rate debt. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above and below market leases, origination costs, acquired in 36 Table of Contents place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above and below market leases at their fair value; using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired, equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (2) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An asset is considered impaired when the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No. 144 are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date. SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which was adopted on January 1, 2002, requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) on the eventual disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of our properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. 37 Table of Contents Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgement. Our capitalization policy on our development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Properties. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in a variable interest entity, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence, but do not control these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over 40 years. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included on the consolidated statements of operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. We serve as the development manager for the joint venture at 901 New York Avenue currently under development. The profit on development fees received from this joint venture is recognized to the extent attributable to the outside interest in the joint venture. Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair value over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. We maintain an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential tenant credit losses. The credit assessment is based on the estimated accrued rental income that is recoverable over the term of the lease. We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required rent payments. The computation of this allowance is based on the tenants payment history and current credit status, as well as certain industry or geographic specific credit considerations. If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in place tenant leases was approximately 7.0 years as of December 31, 2003. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99 19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or Issue 99 19. Issue 99 19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. We record our development fees earned on real estate projects on a straight line basis over the development period, which approximates the percentage of completion method described in SOP 81 1 and provides a more 38 Table of Contents accurate measurement over the period of fees earned. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight line basis, since such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No.66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above and below market leases, origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We calculate the fair value of our mortgage debt notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. In addition, we are also required to adjust the carrying values of our derivative contracts on a quarterly basis to their fair values. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Commencing during the third quarter of 2002, we began reporting on a consolidated basis the gross operating revenues and expenses associated with the ownership of our hotels through our taxable REIT subsidiary, whereas in the past we only reported net lease payments and real estate taxes. As a result the reporting of the hotel operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 is not directly comparable to the year ended 2002. Therefore, hotel revenue and hotel expenses have been presented on a net basis for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2003 (otherwise entitled Hotel Net Operating Income) to provide a basis of comparison to prior periods. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we owned 140 properties and 142 properties, respectively (we refer to all of the properties that we own as our Total Portfolio). Our property operations, including property management, development and leasing are regionally aligned with the objective of becoming the dominant landlord in our core markets. Management reviews operating and financial data for each property separately and independently from all other properties. Major decisions regarding the allocation of financing, investing, information technology and capital allocation are made in conjunction with the input of senior management located in our corporate headquarters. 39 Table of Contents As a result of changes in 2002 within our Total Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenues and expenses from period to period. We do not believe our period to period financial data are comparable due to the changes in our Total Portfolio. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 show changes resulting from properties that we owned for each period compared (we refer to this comparison as our Same Property Portfolio for the applicable period) and the changes attributable to our Total Portfolio. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold, acquired or placed into service for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2002 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 122 properties, including three hotels and four properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2002 and owned by us through December 31, 2003. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in service or acquired after January 1, 2002 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2003. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold, acquired or placed into service for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Our net property operating margins, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses exclusive of the three hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were 67%. 40 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold PropertiesAcquired Properties Placedin Service Total Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2003 2002 Increase/ (Decrease) %Change 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Increase/ (Decrease) %Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 925,770 $ 921,089 $ 4,681 0.51 % $ 2,893 $ 46,285 $ 153,832 $ 33,885 $ 130,528 $ 103,027 $ 1,213,023 $ 1,104,286 $ 108,737 9.85 % Termination Income 6,142 6,820 (678 ) 9.94 % 6,142 6,820 (678 ) 9.94 % Total Rental Revenue 931,912 927,909 4,003 0.43 % 2,893 46,285 153,832 33,885 130,528 103,027 1,219,165 1,111,106 (1) 108,059 9.73 % Operating Expenses 329,921 320,979 8,942 2.79 % 865 11,912 38,496 8,611 31,357 23,359 400,639 364,860 (2) 35,779 9.81 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 601,991 606,930 (4,939 ) 0.81 % 2,028 34,373 115,336 25,274 99,171 79,668 818,526 746,246 72,280 9.69 % Hotel Net Operating Income (3) 17,833 23,284 (5,451 ) 23.41 % 17,833 23,284 (5,451 ) 23.41 % Consolidated Net Operating Income (3) 619,824 630,214 (10,390 ) 1.65 % 2,028 34,373 115,336 25,274 99,171 79,668 836,359 769,530 66,829 8.68 % Other Revenue: Development and Management Services 17,347 10,748 6,599 61.40 % Interest and Other 3,033 5,504 (2,471 ) 44.89 % Total Other Revenue 20,380 16,252 4,128 25.40 % Other Expenses: General and administrative 45,359 47,292 (1,933 ) 4.09 % Interest 299,436 263,067 36,369 13.82 % Depreciation and amortization 155,730 147,579 8,151 5.52 % 275 4,616 26,120 5,202 27,947 22,329 210,072 179,726 30,346 16.88 % Net derivative losses 1,038 11,874 (10,836 ) 91.26 % Loss from early extinguishment of debt 1,474 2,386 (912 ) 38.22 % Loss on investments in securities 4,297 (4,297 ) 100.00 % Total Other Expenses 155,730 147,579 8,151 5.52 % 275 4,616 26,120 5,202 27,947 22,329 557,379 508,642 48,737 9.58 % Income before minority interests 464,094 482,635 (18,541 ) 3.84 % 1,753 29,757 89,216 20,072 71,224 57,339 299,360 277,140 22,220 8.02 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures $ 3,041 $ 4,738 $ (1,697 ) 35.82 % $ 2,975 $ 3,216 6,016 7,954 (1,938 ) 24.37 % Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 2,176 15,310 (13,134 ) 85.79 % Minority interests in property partnerships 1,604 2,171 (567 ) 26.12 % Minority interest in Operating Partnership (74,642 ) (73,980 ) (662 ) 0.89 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 57,574 186,810 (129,236 ) 69.18 % Gains on sales of land held for development, net of minority interest 3,633 (3,633 ) 100.00 % Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 73,234 25,345 47,889 188.95 % Preferred dividend (3,412 ) (3,412 ) 100.00 % Net Income available to common shareholders $ 365,322 $ 440,971 $ (75,649 ) 17.16 % (1) Excludes Hotel Revenue of $12,771 for the year ended December 31, 2002.

For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Page 62. 41 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase in rental revenue of $108.7 million in the Total Portfolio primarily relates to new leases signed and in place in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue in the third quarter of 2002, the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square as of April 1, 2003 and the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Freedom Square as of August 5, 2003, as well as the purchase of 1333 New Hampshire Avenue. These additions to the portfolio increased revenue by approximately $119.9 million, as described below: Revenue for the year ended Property Date Acquired 2003 2002 Change (in thousands) 399 Park Avenue September 25, 2002 $ 129,033 $ 33,885 $ 95,148 One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 9,542 9,542 One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 11,732 11,732 1333 New Hampshire Ave October 8, 2003 3,525 3,525 Total Additions $ 153,832 $ 33,885 $ 119,947 This increase was offset by a decrease of $43.3 million due to the sale of One and Two Independence Square and 2300 N Street during 2002 and 2003 that have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of the properties. In addition, the placing into service of Five Times Square in the first quarter of 2002, continued lease up of 111 Huntington Avenue, Waltham Weston Corporate Center which was placed into service during 2003 and the addition of Shaws Supermarket in Boston added revenue of $27.5 million. The overall increase in the remaining Same Property Portfolio reflects declining base rents of approximately $6.3 million and a slight decrease in occupancy offset by an increase in straight line rents of $5.6 million resulting from increased free rent periods on renewals during 2003 as well as an increase in operating expense reimbursements related to higher operating expenses. Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was related to 21 tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately $6.1 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to 23 tenants totaling $6.8 million. As the business climate continues to improve, we expect termination income will dissipate to levels below 2003 and 2002. Development and Management Services The increase in development and management services income of $6.6 million primarily resulted from the recognition of fees in the current year on certain third party development projects, some of which began in 2002, and an overall increase in management fees due to the continuing involvement in properties sold during 2003. Development fees increased by $2.8 million on the 90 Church Street project in New York City related to the services provided to remediate damages resulting from the events of September 11, 2001. There was an overall increase of $1.1 million in development fees in Washington, D.C. on the National Institute of Health and 901 New York Avenue projects. During 2003, approximately $1.8 million was recognized as development fees on the construction of the residential building, The Belvidere in Boston, MA. The remaining increases relate to new management agreements entered into with the sale of 2300 N Street and One and Two Independence Square for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our third party revenue is project specific and highly dependent on our ability to secure third party development contracts. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased by $2.5 million in the Total Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2003. Of the total variance, $1.0 million is a result of interest earned on a note receivable related to the sale of 42 Table of Contents real estate in September 2002. In addition, during 2002 there was a one time refund of approximately $1.3 million, which related to the resolution of a prior year tax matter. Operating Expenses Property operating expenses in the Total Portfolio (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) increased by $35.8 million. Approximately $29.8 million of the increase is due to the additions of 399 Park Avenue, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, One and Two Discovery Square and One and Two Freedom Square. The increases were offset by a decrease of $11.0 million related to One and Two Independence Square and 2300 N Street which were sold during 2002 and 2003 and that have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of the properties. In addition, the continued lease up of 111 Huntington Avenue, Five Times Square and Waltham Weston Corporate Center properties which were placed into service during 2002 and the placing into service Shaws Supermarket in Boston added approximately $8.0 million of operating expenses. The remaining increases are due to the overall increase in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses of $8.9 million. Property operating expenses in the Same Property Portfolio increased during the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to increases in real estate taxes of $6.7 million, or 5.7%, and increases in insurance of $2.3 million, or 22.3%. The increases in real estate taxes are due to higher property tax assessments and rate increases, specifically in New York, which represented $5.1 million of the increase. Increases in insurance premiums in the Same Property Portfolio and Total Portfolio are related to increases in premium rates on existing coverage as well as the increased cost to purchase coverage under the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. Other decreases were mainly due to an overall decrease in occupancy from 93.9% at December 31, 2002 to 92.1% at December 31, 2003. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties decreased by $5.5 million or approximately 23.41% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. These decreases are due to the ongoing downturn being experienced in business travel and the tourism industry in the Boston market. While our Boston area hotels have yet to show any meaningful improvement, we are cautiously optimistic that they will gradually recover in 2004 with the Democratic National Convention and a number of other city wide events scheduled to be held in Boston. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the three hotel properties for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 Occupancy 77.3 % 80.7 % Average daily rate $ 166.40 $ 181.13 Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 128.78 $ 146.25 Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the Total Portfolio decreased during the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 by $1.9 million or 4.09%. A decrease of $2.8 million is related to the write off of unrecoverable leasing commissions related to our termination of the lease with Arthur Andersen for 620,947 square feet at the Times Square Tower during the second quarter of 2002. In addition, an increase of $2.2 million is attributed to changes in the form of equity based compensation, as further described below. 43 Table of Contents In 2003, we transitioned to using solely restricted stock and or long term incentive plan units of limited partnership, or LTIP units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP units over a five year term. Restricted stock and LTIP units are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted and the price of our Common Stock on the date of grant as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock was $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2003. Stock based compensation associated with $6.1 million of restricted stock that was granted in January 2003 will generally be expensed ratably as such restricted stock vests over a five year vesting period. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $9.4 million of restricted stock and LTIP units that were granted in January 2004 will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP units vest. To the extent we continue our policy of granting restricted equity awards we will continue to experience higher costs associated with equity based compensation until 2008 at which time the incremental increase associated with each years award will be fully realized. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of our strategic decision to replace our variable rate debt with primarily unsecured fixed rate debt and a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest on development projects. This was primarily due to placing into service and cessation of interest capitalization on Five Times Square, 111 Huntington Avenue, Two Freedom Square, Shaws Supermarket and 611 Gateway and the issuance of $1.5 billion of unsecured fixed rate senior notes (including $750 million issued in December 2002). Our total debt outstanding at December 31, 2003 was approximately $5.0 billion compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2002. December 31, 2003 2002 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 4,566,188 $ 3,890,196 Variable rate 438,532 1,257,024 Total $ 5,004,720 $ 5,147,220 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 91.24 % 75.58 % Variable rate 8.76 % 24.42 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.67 % 6.99 % Variable rate 2.87 % 3.04 % Total 6.33 % 6.03 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of the additions and placing into service of Five Times Square, 111 Huntington Avenue, 399 Park Avenue, One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square, 611 Gateway, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue and other properties which 44 Table of Contents we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2002. The increases were offset by decreases of $4.3 million related to properties that were sold during 2002 and 2003 that were not classified as discontinued operations. Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $5.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $19.2 million and $22.5 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Net Derivative Losses Net derivative losses for the Total Portfolio represent the mark to market and cash settlements of our derivative contracts, consisting of interest rate swaps, payments that were not effective for accounting purposes. The fair value of our derivative contract which was $8.2 million at December 31, 2003, is included on our balance sheets. As a result of our contract modification in August 2003 we will have no further earnings volatility on the remaining derivative contract. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Joint Ventures The decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Total Portfolio as well as the Same Property Portfolio is related to the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square and One and Two Freedom Square. One and Two Discovery Square are included in the Total Portfolio Revenue as of April 1, 2003. One and Two Freedom Square are included in the Total Portfolio Revenue as of August 5, 2003. The reclassification of these properties caused the overall income from joint ventures to decrease for the year ended December 31, 2003. Other Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to the sale of 2300 N Street in the first quarter for a gain of $52.9 million. In the second and third quarter, there was a transfer of certain mortgage issuance costs, as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements that resulted in a gain of $4.8 million (net of minority interest share of $1.0 million.) Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to the sale of One and Two Independence Square were not included in discontinued operations as we have continuing involvement through a third party management agreement after the sale. The decrease in income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 was a result of the discontinued properties being sold during the first quarter of 2003. Accordingly, unlike in 2002 we did not recognize a full quarter of revenue and expenses with respect to those properties for the first, second or third quarter of 2003. In addition, income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 included two properties sold during 2002. For both periods, Sugarland Business Park Building Two and 430 Rozzi Place are included as part of income from discontinued operations. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily related to the gain recognized on the sale of 875 Third Avenue and The Candler Building. The gains on sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 are the result of the dispositions of (1) Fullerton Square, consisting of two office/technical properties totaling 179,453 square feet in Springfield, Virginia and (2) 7600, 7700, and 7702 Boston Boulevard, consisting of three buildings totaling 195,227 square feet in Springfield, Virginia. The decrease in our preferred dividend of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 was a result of the conversion of 2,000,000 shares of our preferred stock into common stock in July 2002. 45 Table of Contents Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2002 to the year ended December 31, 2001 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 116 properties, including three hotels and five properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2001 and owned by us through December 31, 2003. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in service or acquired after January 1, 2001 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2003. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Portfolio, detailing properties which were sold, acquired or placed into service for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. Our net property operating margins, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses exclusive of the three hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was approximately 67%. 46 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold PropertiesAcquired Properties Placedin Service Total Portfolio 2002 2001 Increase/ (Decrease) %Change 2002 2001 2002 2001 2002 2001 2002 2001 Increase/ (Decrease) %Change (dollars in thousands) Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 805,202 $ 791,870 $ 13,332 1.68 % $ 46,285 $ 50,239 $ 131,392 $ 64,776 $ 121,407 $ 13,298 $ 1,104,286 $ 920,183 $ 184,103 20.01 % Termination Income 6,820 7,230 (410 ) 5.67 % 1,426 6,820 8,656 (1,836 ) 21.21 % Total Rental Revenue 812,022 799,100 12,922 1.62 % 46,285 50,239 131,392 64,776 121,407 14,724 1,111,106 (1) 928,839 (1) 182,267 19.62 % Operating Expenses 282,524 270,123 12,401 4.59 % 11,912 12,436 43,162 21,668 27,262 3,812 364,860 (2) 308,040 (2) 56,820 18.45 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 529,498 528,977 521 0.01 % 34,373 37,803 88,230 43,108 94,145 10,912 746,246 620,799 125,447 20.21 % Hotel Net Operating Income (3) 23,284 26,549 (3,265 ) 12.30 % 23,284 26,549 (3,265 ) 12.30 % Consolidated Net Operating Income (3) 552,782 555,526 (2,744 ) 0.49 % 34,373 37,803 88,230 43,108 94,145 10,912 769,530 647,348 122,182 18.87 % Other Revenue: Development and Management Services 10,748 12,167 (1,419 ) 11.66 % Interest and Other 5,504 12,183 (6,679 ) 54.82 % Total Other Revenue 16,252 24,350 (8,098 ) 33.26 % Other Expenses: General and administrative 47,292 38,312 8,980 23.44 % Interest 263,067 211,391 51,676 24.45 % Depreciation and amortization 130,640 125,048 5,592 4.47 % 4,617 5,617 18,883 9,431 25,586 3,364 179,726 143,460 36,266 25.28 % Net derivative losses 11,874 26,488 (14,614 ) 55.17 % Loss from early extinguishments of debt 2,386 2,386 100.00 % Loss on investments in securities 4,297 6,500 (2,203 ) 33.89 % Total Other Expenses 130,640 125,048 5,592 4.47 % 4,617 5,617 18,883 9,431 25,586 3,364 508,642 426,151 82,491 19.36 % Income before minority interests 422,142 430,478 (8,336 ) 1.94 % 29,756 32,186 69,347 33,677 68,559 7,548 277,140 245,547 31,593 12.87 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures $ 5,225 $ 4,013 $ (1,212 ) 30.20 % $ 2,729 $ 173 7,954 4,186 3,768 90.01 % Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ 1,135 $ 2,829 $ (1,694 ) 59.88 % $ 14,175 $ 21,683 15,310 24,512 (9,202 ) 37.54 % Minority interests in property partnerships 2,171 1,194 977 81.83 % Minority interest in Operating Partnership (73,980 ) (69,729 ) (4,251 ) 6.10 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 186,810 6,505 180,305 2.,771.79 % Gains on sales of land held for development, net of minority interest 3,633 2,584 1,049 40.60 % Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 25,345 25,345 100.00 % Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest (6,767 ) 6,767 100.00 % Preferred dividend (3,412 ) (6,592 ) (3,180 ) 48.24 % Net Income available to common shareholders $ 440,971 $ 201,440 $ 239,531 118.91 % (1) Excludes Hotel Revenue of $12,771 and $32,330 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(2) Excludes Hotel Operating Expenses of $3,187 and $5,781 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These amounts are included as part of Hotel Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and have been included as part of Hotel Net Operating Income in the table above. (3) See Page 39 for a discussion of Hotel Net Operating Income. For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see Page 62. 47 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase in rental revenue of $184.1 million in the Total Portfolio primarily relates to new leases signed and in place at December 31, 2002 in connection with the acquisition of Citigroup Center in the second quarter of 2001 and the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue in the third quarter of 2002, the commencement of occupancy at 111 Huntington Avenue in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the placing into service of Five Times Square in the first quarter of 2002. These increased revenue by $174.7 million. This increase was offset by a decrease of approximately $4.0 million related to the sale of One and Two Independence Square during 2002 that have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of these properties after the sale. Properties sold during 2002 included One and Two Independence Square, 2391 West Winton Avenue, Fullerton Square, 875 Third Avenue and 7600, 770 and 7702 Boston Boulevard. The overall increases in the Same Property Portfolio of $13.3 million account for the remaining increase in the total portfolio revenue. Termination Income The termination income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was related to twenty three tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately $6.8 million. This compared to termination income received in the prior year related primarily to thirty three tenants throughout our portfolio who terminated their leases in 2001 and made termination payments totaling approximately $8.7 million. Development and Management Services The decrease in development and management income of $1.4 million primarily resulted from the completions of projects during 2001, including certain third party contracts as well as certain of our joint venture projects. This was offset by development fees earned on a new joint venture project which was started in 2002 as well as, an increase in management fees relating to certain of our joint ventures which were placed into service in 2002. Our third party revenue is project specific and highly dependent on our ability to secure third party development contracts. Interest and Other Income The decrease in interest and other income related to the Total Portfolio is a result of less interest earned due to lower average cash balances maintained and lower interest rates on cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the higher average cash balance was attributable to unused proceeds from our public offering of common stock in October 2000. Operating Expenses Property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) in the Total Property portfolio increased by $56.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $44.9 million of increase in property operating expenses were primarily due to the additions of the Citigroup Center, Five Times Square, 399 Park Avenue and 111 Huntington Avenue properties that we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2001. The office leases include reimbursements from tenants for a portion of these operating expenses. The increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $1.0 million related to One and Two Independence Square and 2300 N Street which were sold during 2002 and 2003 and that have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of the properties after the sale, reflected as properties sold in the table above. Property operating expenses in the Same Property Portfolio increased during the year ended December 31, 2002 primarily due to increases in real estate taxes of $5.2 million, or 5.0%, and increases in insurance of $4.1 48 Table of Contents million, or 70.6%. The increase in real estate taxes was primarily due to higher property tax assessments. Increases in insurance in the Same Property Portfolio and Total Portfolio are related to increases in rates on existing coverage and the purchase of a separate stand alone terrorism policy. Overall increases in the same property portfolio of $3.1 million account for the remaining increase in the Same Property portfolio operating expenses. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties decreased by $3.3 million or approximately 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. These decreases were related to the general downturn in the economy as well as lasting effects of September 11, 2001. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the three hotel properties for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 Occupancy 80.7 % 80.5 % Average daily rate $ 181.13 $ 197.39 Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 146.25 $ 158.50 Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the Total Portfolio increased during the year ended December 31, 2002 by approximately $9.0 million, of which $2.8 million related to the write off in the second quarter of non recoverable commissions related to the termination of the lease with Arthur Andersen for 620,947 square feet at the Times Square Tower development project. The remaining increase related primarily to increases in compensation and related expenses, specifically an increase of $3.3 million related to bonuses awarded to senior management for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. Stock based compensation associated with restricted stock units was $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. Additional amounts include a $1.4 million increase related to a decrease in capitalized wages resulting from decreased development activity in 2002 compared to the year ended December 31, 2001, and a $0.5 million increase in costs incurred related to implementing the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of having a higher average outstanding debt balance as compared to the prior period as well as decreased interest capitalization. This was primarily due to placing into service and cessation of interest capitalization on Five Times Square, 111 Huntington Avenue and 611 Gateway and new debt incurred related to the acquisition of Citigroup Center and 399 Park Avenue. Our total debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 was approximately $5.1 billion, compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2001. 49 Table of Contents December 31, 2002 2001 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,890,196 $ 3,448,903 Variable rate 1,257,024 866,039 Total $ 5,147,220 $ 4,314,942 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 75.58 % 79.93 % Variable rate 24.42 % 20.07 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.99 % 7.27 % Variable rate 3.04 % 3.77 % Total 6.03 % 6.57 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of the additions of the Citigroup Center, Five Times Square, 111 Huntington Avenue and 399 Park Avenue properties and other properties that we acquired or placed in service after January 1, 2001. The increases were offset by decreases related to properties that were sold during 2002 that were not included in discontinued operations. Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $5.1 million and $6.6 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $22.5 million and $59.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Net Derivative Losses Net derivative losses represent the mark to market of our derivative contracts and payments that were not effective for accounting purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized a reduction in the fair value of our contracts as a result of generally low interest rates. The fair value of our derivative contracts is included on our balance sheets. Loss from early extinguishments of debt The loss from early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to a debt extinguishment charge we incurred in connection with the prepayment of debt in connection with the sale of a property. Loss on investments in securities During the year ended December 31, 2002, we recognized losses on our investments in securities of approximately $4.3 million. This loss was related to the write off of our investment in the securities of a technology company due to the Companys determination that the decline in the fair value of these securities was an other than temporary decline. The loss on investment of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 was related to the write off of investments in securities of two technology companies. 50 Table of Contents Joint Ventures Income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary result of the increase is related to the completion of the repositioning of 265 Franklin Street during 2001 as well as receiving preferential returns on certain other joint ventures resulting from the achievement of specified investment return thresholds. The additional increase in the total portfolio is related to the placing in service of One and Two Discovery Square. Excluded from Same Property Portfolio is Discovery Square and Two Freedom Square due to their development. Other Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to the sale of One and Two Independence Square which were not included in discontinued operations, as we have continuing involvement through a third party management agreement after the sale. The decrease in income from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 was a result of the discontinued properties being sold prior to December 31, 2002, and therefore, we did not recognize a full year of revenue and expenses as we did in the prior year. Properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 included 875 Third Avenue, The Candler Building, Fullerton Square, 2391 West Winton and 7600, 7700 and 7702 Boston Boulevard. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to the gain recognized on the properties that were sold. These properties included Fullerton Square, 2391 West Winton and 7600, 7700 and 7702 Boston Boulevard. The decrease in our preferred dividend from $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 was a result of the conversion of 2,000,000 shares of our preferred stock into common stock in July 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service requirements including the repayment or refinancing of $65.9 million of indebtedness that matures within the twelve month period; fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund current development costs not covered under construction loans; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe that these needs will be satisfied using cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities. Rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, and other income from operations are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, 51 Table of Contents will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, would adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes. Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments, property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long term secured and unsecured indebtedness; income from operations; joint ventures; sales of real estate; issuances of additional common and Preferred Units and or our equity securities; and our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short term bridge facilities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs. Our line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities and meet short term development needs. We fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by Boston Properties Limited Partnership until project completion or lease up thresholds are achieved. In 2003 we completed three highly successful offerings of unsecured investment grade senior notes and expect to utilize the bond market, asset backed mortgage financing and common and preferred equity as cost effective capital sources for other long term capital needs. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in
