Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward Looking Statements This Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on managements beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, might, plan, estimate, project, should, will, result and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include, among others, the following: general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments; failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets or to integrate acquisitions successfully; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed; and the other risk factors identified in this Form 10 K, including those described under the caption Risk Factors. 37 Table of Contents The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item I Business Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8 K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8 K or otherwise. Overview We are a fully integrated self administered and self managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in four core markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, costs of tenant improvements, operating costs and real estate taxes, vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors. Improvement in our industrys performance is generally predicated on a sustained pattern of job growth. Office market conditions, generally viewed as having bottomed out in 2003, showed further improvement during 2004 in midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C. and Princeton, New Jersey. In Boston and San Francisco, our two other markets, we are cautiously optimistic that we are seeing the beginning of a recovery in job growth that will generate additional demand for office space. Even in those markets where tenants are expanding, however, landlord pricing power is still constrained by the number of competitive alternatives available. In this climate, we believe our corporate strategy of owning and developing high quality office buildings concentrated in strong, supply constrained markets and emphasizing long term leases to creditworthy tenants has allowed us to perform well relative to our peers in difficult markets and even better in favorable markets. In addition, we believe our financial strategy of matching long term fixed rate debt with our long term leases insulates us from rising interest costs and, accordingly, we have fixed the interest rate on 91% of our outstanding debt. During 2004, our strategy enabled us to complete more than six million square feet of leasing while managing transactions costs and non recurring capital expenses. In addition, we commenced construction on $286.8 million of new developments which we expect will be placed into service during 2006 and 2007. Other highlights of our 2004 activity include the following. We completed the construction of two development projects, the 1,234,218 square foot Times Square Tower building in New York City, New York and the 257,400 square foot New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two building in Fairfax County, Virginia. Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two are currently 87.8% and 100.0% leased, respectively. We leveraged our strong relationships to acquire $97.2 million of interests in real estate assets in the Washington, D.C. area, and we acquired our partners interest in a joint venture in the Boston suburbs for $21.6 million in cash and the assumption of our partners share of the mortgage debt on the properties of approximately $41.6 million. We sold eighteen properties totaling 767,000 square feet and three land parcels for sale prices totaling $117 million. On March 3, 2004, we completed a public offering of 5,700,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $51.40 per share. The proceeds from this public offering, net of underwriters discount and offering costs, totaled approximately $291.1 million. We used the proceeds from this offering to 38 Table of Contents repay approximately $110.3 million in mortgage indebtedness related to three properties, together with prepayment penalties totaling approximately $6.3 million as well as to acquire the remaining interest in one of our joint ventures for approximately $21.6 million. We formed the Value Added Fund, which is a strategic partnership with two institutional investors, to pursue the acquisition of assets within our existing markets that have deficiencies in property characteristics which provide an opportunity to create value through repositioning, refurbishment or renovation. Looking ahead, we believe 2005 will follow a pattern similar to that of 2004, with office rental markets continuing to strengthen, but with improvement coming gradually. We expect allocators of capital to continue to place a premium on high quality, well located office buildings resulting in lower capitalization rates and higher prices per square foot. As an owner of these types of assets, we are pleased with higher valuations and intend to sell non core properties to realize some of this value. However, these conditions also make it more difficult to acquire assets at what we believe to be attractive rates of return. We will continue to be patient as markets recover, demand grows and development proceeds on the significant pre lease projects underway and stand ready to aggressively capitalize on opportunities with our well positioned balance sheet where we can use our competitive edge to enhance performance. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above and below market leases, origination costs, acquired in place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above and below market leases at their fair value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts 39 Table of Contents to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (2) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, (SFAS No. 144) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date. SFAS No. 144, which was adopted on January 1, 2002, requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgement. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Properties. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy, and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portion under construction. 40 Table of Contents Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over 40 years or the term of the agreement, if shorter. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interest in variance interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. Our leasing strategy is generally to secure financially stable tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenants creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: Review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; debt to market capitalization; and liquidity evaluate the depth and experience of the tenants management team perform an analysis of the tenants industry As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: low risk tenants the tenants credit is such that we require collateral require security deposit; and reduce upfront tenant improvement investment tenants credit is below our acceptable parameters 41 Table of Contents We maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenants inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential loses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1 4 with a rating of 1 representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of 4 representing the lowest credit rating, recording a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; and industry or geographical specific credit considerations If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in place tenant leases was approximately 7.6 years as of December 31, 2004. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and continual monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99 19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or Issue 99 19. Issue 99 19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight line basis, since such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above and below market leases, origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over 42 Table of Contents their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage debt notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Commencing during the third quarter of 2002, we began reporting on a consolidated basis the gross operating revenues and expenses associated with the ownership of our hotels through our taxable REIT subsidiary, whereas we had previously only reported net lease payments and real estate taxes. As a result, the reporting of the hotel operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 is not directly comparable to the year ended 2002. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 125 and 140 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period to period financial data are comparable. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the year ended 2004 and 2003 show separately changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio) and the changes attributable to the Total Property Portfolio. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, net derivative losses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, losses from early extinguishments of debt and losses on investments in securities, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and land held for development (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services income. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. 43 Table of Contents Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a propertys results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2004 to the year ended December 31, 2003 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 112 properties, including three hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2003 and owned by us through December 31, 2004. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either, placed in service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2003 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2004. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the properties which were sold, acquired, placed in service or repositioned for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Our net property operating margins, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses, exclusive of the three hotel properties, for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, were 69.1% and 69.5%, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio PropertiesSold PropertiesAcquired PropertiesPlaced In Service PropertiesRepositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) %Change 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 Increase/ (Decrease) %Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,146,166 $ 1,147,870 ($ 1,704 ) (0.15 %) $ 138 $ 4,532 $ 77,893 $ 24,796 $ 50,735 $ 9,455 $ 14,369 $ 16,457 $ 1,289,301 $ 1,203,110 $ 86,191 7.17 % Termination Income 3,724 6,136 (2,412 ) (39.31 %) 267 3,991 6,136 (2,145 ) (34.96 %) Total Rental Revenue 1,149,890 1,154,006 (4,116 ) (0.36 %) 138 4,532 78,160 24,796 50,735 9,455 14,369 16,457 1,293,292 1,209,246 84,046 6.95 % Operating Expenses 390,097 384,574 5,523 1.44 % 39 1,222 17,416 5,078 7,199 2,230 4,271 4,205 419,022 397,309 21,713 5.47 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 759,793 769,432 (9,639 ) (1.25 %) 99 3,310 60,744 19,718 43,536 7,225 10,098 12,252 874,270 811,937 62,333 7.68 % Hotel Net Operating Income 20,618 17,833 2,785 15.62 % 20,618 17,833 2,785 15.62 % Consolidated Net Operating Income (1) 780,411 787,265 (6,854 ) (0.87 %) 99 3,310 60,744 19,718 43,536 7,225 10,098 12,252 894,888 829,770 65,118 7.85 % Other Revenue: Development and Management services 20,464 17,347 3,117 17.97 % Interest and Other 10,367 3,033 7,334 241.81 % Total Other Revenue 30,831 20,380 10,451 51.28 % Other Expenses: General and administrative 53,636 45,359 8,277 18.25 % Interest 306,170 299,436 6,734 2.25 % Depreciation and amortization 217,002 197,155 19,847 10.07 % 22 518 18,947 6,452 11,215 2,506 5,070 1,859 252,256 208,490 43,766 21.00 % Net derivative losses 1,038 (1,038 ) (100.00 %) Losses from early extinguishments of debt 6,258 1,474 4,784 324.56 % Total Other Expenses 217,002 197,155 19,847 10.07 % 22 518 18,947 6,452 11,215 2,506 5,070 1,859 618,320 555,797 62,523 11.25 % Income before minority interests 563,409 590,110 (26,701 ) (4.53 %) 77 2,792 41,797 13,266 32,321 4,719 5,028 10,393 307,399 294,353 13,046 4.44 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 3,054 1,903 1,151 60.49 % 304 4,113 (33 ) 55 3,380 6,016 (2,636 ) (43.82 %) Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 1,240 6,102 1,240 6,102 (4,862 ) (79.68 %) Minority interests in property partnerships 4,685 1,827 2,858 156.43 % Minority interest in Operating Partnership (68,174 ) (73,784 ) 5,610 7.61 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 8,149 57,574 (49,425 ) (85.85 %) Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 27,338 73,234 (45,896 ) (62.67 %) Net Income available to common shareholders $ 284,017 $ 365,322 ($ 81,305 ) (22.26 %) (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 71. 45 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase in rental revenue of $86.2 million in the Total Property Portfolio primarily relates to the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square as of April 1, 2003, the remaining interests in One and Two Freedom Square as of August 5, 2003, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue on October 8, 2003 and 140 Kendrick Street as of March 24, 2004, as well as the acquisition of 1330 Connecticut Avenue on April 1, 2004. These additions to the portfolio increased revenue by approximately $53.1 million, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Revenue for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 $ 13,131 $ 9,541 $ 3,590 One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 29,938 11,731 18,207 1333 New Hampshire Avenue October 8, 2003 15,480 3,524 11,956 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 8,474 8,474 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 10,870 10,870 Total $ 77,893 $ 24,796 $ 53,097 In addition, the placing into service of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, as well as Shaws Supermarket and Waltham Weston Corporate Center during 2003, increased revenue by approximately $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as detailed below: Property Date Placed inService Revenue for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3rd Quarter 2004 $ 36,470 $ 2,463 $ 34,007 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1st Quarter 2003 6,599 4,613 1,986 Shaws Supermarket 2nd Quarter 2003 3,263 2,379 884 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3rd Quarter 2004 4,403 4,403 Total $ 50,735 $ 9,455 $ 41,280 The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by a decrease of approximately $4.4 million due to the sale of 2300 N Street during 2003 and Hilltop Office Center during 2004, both of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continued involvement in the management of the properties. The decrease in the remaining Same Property Portfolio reflects a decrease in straight line rents of $7.6 million, which was partially offset by an increase in rental revenue, including operating income, parking and other income, of approximately $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We anticipate that we will experience a roll down of approximately 15% to 20% in rents in 2005 on our expiring leases which will be partially offset by increased occupancy and greater contributions from newly delivered buildings such as Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two. In September 2004, we commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. Capital Gallery is a Class A office property totaling approximately 397,000 square feet. The project entails removing a three story low rise section of the property comprised of 100,000 square feet from in service status and developing it into a 10 story office building resulting in a total complex size of approximately 610,000 square feet upon completion. The classification of this property is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2004. Rental revenue has decreased for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to taking the three story low rise out of service in September 2004. 46 Table of Contents Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2004 was related to twenty tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately $4.0 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to nineteen tenants totaling $6.1 million. We have experienced a reduction in the number of tenants having trouble paying rent and bankruptcy issues. In addition, fewer tenants have been making efforts to terminate or restructure their leases in order to provide them with financial relief. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In the first quarter of 2004 we recognized a net amount of approximately $7.0 million in connection with the termination by a third party of an agreement to enter into a ground lease with us. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2004, we had a cash balance of approximately $239.3 million which also contributed to higher interest earnings. To the extent we do not use our cash balance to acquire properties, fund new developments, or reduce outstanding indebtedness, we anticipate interest income to increase slightly based on anticipated increases in interest rates. Operating Expenses Property operating expenses in the Total Property Portfolio (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) increased by $21.7 million. Same Property Portfolio real estate tax expense increased approximately $7.4 million for the year end due to increased real estate tax assessments, specifically in New York City. This increase was offset by a decrease of approximately $2.3 million across the portfolio in repairs and maintenance expenses for the year end as well as increases in other expenses of approximately $0.5 million, resulting in a net increase to Same Property Portfolio operating expenses of approximately $5.5 million. Approximately $12.3 million of the increase in Total Property Portfolio operating expenses primarily relates to the additions of One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Operating Expenses for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 $ 2,775 $ 1,939 $ 836 One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 6,901 2,499 4,402 1333 New Hampshire Avenue October 8, 2003 3,541 640 2,901 140 Kendrick Street March 24, 2004 1,213 1,213 1330 Connecticut Avenue April 1, 2004 2,986 2,986 Total $ 17,416 $ 5,078 $ 12,338 47 Table of Contents In addition, the placing into service of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two during the third quarter of 2004, as well as Shaws Supermarket and Waltham Weston Corporate Center during 2003, increased operating expenses by approximately $5.0 million, as detailed below: Property Date Placed inService Operating Expenses for the year ended 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) Times Square Tower 3rd Quarter 2004 $ 4,054 $ $ 4,054 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1st Quarter 2003 2,360 2,022 338 Shaws Supermarket 2nd Quarter 2003 364 208 156 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two 3rd Quarter 2004 421 421 Total $ 7,199 $ 2,230 $ 4,969 These increases were offset by a decrease of an aggregate of $1.2 million related to the sales of 2300 N Street in 2003 and Hilltop Office Center in 2004, both of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continued involvement in the management of the properties. Our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. has been classified as Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2004. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties increased by approximately $2.8 million, or approximately 15.62%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. On a year to year comparison, the hotels showed improvement and we expect this improvement to continue into 2005. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the three hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: 2004 2003 Increase Occupancy 80.6 % 77.3 % 4.3 % Average daily rate $ 175.32 $ 166.40 5.4 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 141.69 $ 128.78 10.0 % Development and Management Services Our third party fee income increased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended 2004 compared to 2003. Our third party fees in Washington, D.C. with National Institute of Health and in New York at 90 Church Street collectively increased development and management services by $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The completion of these projects along with the winding down of other projects is expected to result in a decrease of approximately $10.0 million of third party management income in 2005. We will continue to pursue new fee services during 2005 and in future years; however, 2005 will be focused on our increased pipeline of development projects which we commenced in 2004. Our management fees increased approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the Total Property Portfolio increased for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2003 by $8.3 million, or 18.25%. An aggregate of approximately $1.8 million of the increase is attributable to changes in the form of long term equity based compensation, as further described below. During the fourth quarter we exercised our right to terminate the purchase agreement to acquire the 21 acre site on the Boston waterfront known as Fan Pier. In conjunction with 48 Table of Contents the termination, we recognized approximately $1.1 million of general and administrative expense consisting of our share of the forfeited deposit of $0.8 million and approximately $0.3 million of related due diligence costs. In addition, we recognized an expense of $0.75 million representing our payment to Alan B. Landis in connection with the amendment to the development agreement, as further detailed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other major increases during 2004 included the following: (1) increases in state taxes based on income and net worth of approximately $1.2 million; (2) increases of approximately $0.8 million in professional fees in connection with the Sarbanes Oxley Act as well as fees related to increased responsibilities of our Board of Directors; and (3) an increase of approximately $2.3 million related to bonus and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2004. In 2003, we issued restricted stock and or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five year term (0%, 0%, 25%, 35%, and 40%). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are measured at fair market value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock was approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Stock based compensation expense associated with $6.1 million of restricted stock that was granted in January 2003 will generally be expensed ratably as such restricted stock vests over a five year vesting period. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $9.7 million granted in January 2004 and approximately $12.5 million granted in January 2005 of restricted stock and LTIP units will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. To the extent we continue to grant restricted stock and LTIP awards, our expenses will continue to increase significantly until 2008 even if there are no future increases in the aggregate value of restricted equity granted each year. This is because we expense the value of the restricted stock and LTIP awards ratably over the five year vesting period and a full run rate will not be achieved until 2008. 49 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $6.7 million. The majority of the increase is due to the cessation of interest capitalization at Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two, as well as the acquisition of 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue, which were offset by the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt on One and Two Reston Overlook, as well as the Lockheed Martin building and NIMA building in the beginning of 2004. Our floating rate debt now consists entirely of our refinanced construction loan on Times Square Tower. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2004 compared with 2003. December 31, 2004 2003 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 4,588,024 $ 4,566,188 Variable rate 423,790 438,532 Total $ 5,011,814 $ 5,004,720 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 91.54 % 91.24 % Variable rate 8.46 % 8.76 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.66 % 6.67 % Variable rate 3.36 % 2.87 % Total 6.38 % 6.33 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of the acquisitions of One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, 140 Kendrick Street and 1330 Connecticut Avenue as well as the properties placed in service during 2003 and 2004. These additions to the portfolio increased depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $21.2 million, as detailed below: Depreciation for the year ended Property Acquired/Placedin Service 2004 2003 Change (in thousands) One and Two Freedom Square Acquired $ 7,435 $ 3,004 $ 4,431 Times Square Tower Placed in service 7,067 7,067 1333 New Hampshire Avenue Acquired 4,287 1,139 3,148 One and Two Discovery Square Acquired 3,364 2,309 1,055 Waltham Weston Corporate Center Placed in service 2,549 2,152 397 1330 Connecticut Avenue Acquired 2,292 2,292 140 Kendrick Street Acquired 1,569 1,569 Shaws Supermarket Placed in service 542 354 188 New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two Placed in service 1,057 1,057 Total Additions $ 30,162 $ 8,958 $ 21,204 50 Table of Contents In September 2004, we commenced the redevelopment of our Capital Gallery property in Washington, D.C. which is classified as Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2004. In connection with the redevelopment project, we recognized an accelerated depreciation charge of approximately $2.6 million, which represents the net book value of the portion of the three story, low rise portion of the building which will be redeveloped. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $5.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $10.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. During the third quarter of 2004, we placed the development projects comprised of Times Square Tower and New Dominion Technology Park, Building Two into service and ceased capitalizing interest in accordance with our capitalization policy. Net Derivative Losses Net derivative losses for the Total Property Portfolio represent the adjustments to fair value and cash settlements of our derivative contract that are not effective for accounting purposes. The fair value of our derivative contract, which was $1.2 million at December 31, 2004, is included within our consolidated balance sheets. As a result of to the expiration of this derivative contract in February 2005, we will have no further earnings volatility on the remaining derivative contract. See Part II Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Joint Ventures The decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Total Property Portfolio is related to purchasing the remaining interests in 140 Kendrick Street, One and Two Freedom Square and One and Two Discovery Square. 140 Kendrick Street is included in the Total Property Portfolio as of March 24, 2004. One and Two Freedom Square are included in the Total Property Portfolio as of August 5, 2003. One and Two Discovery Square are included in the Total Property Portfolio as of April 1, 2003. The reclassification of these properties caused the overall income from unconsolidated joint ventures to decrease $3.8 million, which was offset by an increase in Same Property Joint Venture income of approximately $1.2 million. Included in our share of Same Property Joint Venture income is termination income of approximately $1.8 million, of which our share is approximately $1.0 million earned in the second quarter of 2004. Joint Ventures acquired during 2004 include 801 New Jersey Avenue and the Value Added Fund. Included in the Value Added Fund is approximately $0.2 million of initial organization costs which resulted in a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004. 51 Table of Contents Other The decrease in income from discontinued operations in the Total Property Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a result of properties sold or designated as held for sale during the end of 2003 and beginning of 2004 which are no longer included in our operations as of December 31, 2004. Below is a list of properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Year ended December 31, 2004 Year ended December 31, 2003 Sugarland Business Park Building One Sugarland Business Park Building One 204 Second Avenue 204 Second Avenue 560 Forbes Boulevard 560 Forbes Boulevard Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven 38 Cabot Boulevard 38 Cabot Boulevard The Arboretum The Arboretum 430 Rozzi Place 430 Rozzi Place Sugarland Business Park Building Two Sugarland Business Park Building Two 875 Third Avenue The Candler Building Gains on the sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2004 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Hilltop Office Center and a land parcel in Burlington, MA. Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily relate to the sale of 2300 N Street. These properties are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee equivalent to market, of these properties after the sales. Properties included in our gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 in the Total Portfolio are shown below: Year ended December 31, 2004 Date Disposed Year ended December 31, 2003 Date Disposed 430 Rozzi Place January 2004 The Candler Building January 2003 Sugarland Business Park Building Two February 2004 875 Third Avenue February 2003 Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven April 2004 The Arboretum April 2004 38 Cabot Boulevard May 2004 Sugarland Business Park Building One August 2004 204 Second Avenue September 2004 560 Forbes Boulevard December 2004 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2002 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 107 properties, including three hotels and three properties in which we have joint venture interests, acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2002 and owned by us through December 31, 2003. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effect of the other properties either placed in service or acquired after January 1, 2002 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2004. This table includes a reconciliation from Same Property Portfolio to Total Property Portfolio, detailing properties which were sold, acquired or placed into service for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. Our net property operating margins, which are defined as rental revenue less operating expenses exclusive of the three hotel properties for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, were approximately 69.5% and 69.1%, respectively. 52 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold PropertiesAcquired Properties PlacedIn Service Total Property Portfolio 2003 2002 Increase/ (Decrease) %Change 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 2003 2002 Increase/ (Decrease) %Change (dollars in thousands) Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 911,760 $ 908,337 $ 3,423 0.38 % $ 4,532 $ 48,169 $ 153,829 $ 33,886 $ 132,989 $ 103,052 $ 1,203,110 $ 1,093,444 $ 109,666 10.03 % Termination Income 6,136 6,805 (669 ) (9.84 %) 15 6,136 6,820 (684 ) (10.03 %) Total Rental Revenue 917,896 915,142 2,754 0.30 % 4,532 48,184 153,829 33,886 132,989 103,052 1,209,246 1,100,264 (1) 108,982 9.91 % Operating Expenses 325,535 318,076 7,549 2.35 % 1,222 12,300 38,272 8,384 32,280 22,980 397,309 361,740 (2) 35,569 9.84 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotels 592,361 597,066 (4,705 ) (0.79 %) 3,310 35,884 115,557 25,502 100,709 80,072 811,937 738,524 73,413 9.94 % Hotel Net Operating Income (3) 17,833 23,216 (5,383 ) (23.19 %) 17,833 23,216 (5,383 ) (23.19 %) Consolidated Net Operating Income (3) 610,194 620,282 (10,088 ) (1.63 %) 3,310 35,884 115,557 25,502 100,709 80,072 829,770 761,740 68,030 8.93 % Other Revenue: Development and Management Services 17,347 10,748 6,599 61.40 % Interest and other 3,033 5,504 (2,471 ) (44.90 %) Total Other Revenue 20,380 16,252 4,128 25.40 % Other Expenses: General and administrative 45,359 47,292 (1,933 ) (4.09 %) Interest 299,436 263,067 36,369 13.83 % Depreciation and amortization 153,693 145,819 7,874 5.40 % 518 4,813 26,120 5,202 28,159 22,329 208,490 178,163 30,327 17.03 % Net derivative losses 1,038 11,874 (10,836 ) (91.26 %) Losses from early extinguishments of debt 1,474 2,386 (912 ) (38.23 %) Loss on investment in securities 4,297 (4,297 ) (100.0 %) Total Other Expenses 153,693 145,819 7,874 5.40 % 518 4,813 26,120 5,202 28,159 22,329 555,797 507,079 48,718 9.61 % Income before minority interests 456,501 474,463 (17,962 ) (3.79 %) 2,792 31,071 89,437 20,300 72,550 57,743 294,353 270,913 23,440 8.66 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 1,901 3,111 (1,210 ) (38.90 %) 4,115 4,843 6,016 7,954 (1,938 ) (24.37 %) Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 4,170 5,465 (1,295 ) (23.70 %) 1,932 14,755 6,102 20,220 (14,118 ) (69.83 %) Minority interests in property partnerships 1,827 2,408 (581 ) (24.13 %) Minority interest in Operating Partnership (73,784 ) (72,900 ) (884 ) (1.22 %) Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 57,574 186,810 (129,236 ) (69.18 %) Gains on sales of land held for development, net of minority interest 3,633 (3,633 ) (100.00 %) Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 73,234 25,345 47,889 188.95 % Preferred dividend (3,412 ) 3,412 100.00 % Net Income available to common shareholders $ 365,322 $ 440,971 ($ 75,649 ) (17.16 %) (1) Excludes Hotel Revenue of $12,702 for the years ended December 31, 2002.

For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 71. 53 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase in rental revenue of $109.7 million in the Total Property Portfolio primarily relates to new leases signed and in place in connection with the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue in the third quarter of 2002, the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square as of April 1, 2003, the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Freedom Square as of August 5, 2003, as well as the purchase of 1333 New Hampshire Avenue as of October 8, 2003. These additions to the portfolio increased revenue by approximately $119.9 million, as described below: Revenue for the year ended Property Date Acquired 2003 2002 Change (in thousands) 399 Park Avenue September 25, 2002 $ 129,033 $ 33,886 $ 95,147 One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 9,541 9,541 One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 11,731 11,731 1333 New Hampshire Ave October 8, 2003 3,524 3,524 Total Additions $ 153,829 $ 33,886 $ 119,943 This increase was offset by a decrease of $43.6 million due to the sale of One and Two Independence Square and 2300 N Street during 2002 and 2003 as well as Hilltop Office Center during 2004, all of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of the properties. During 2002 we placed into service Five Times Square and other properties detailed below. These additions contributed approximately $29.9 million of revenue. Revenue for the year ended Property Date Placed inService 2003 2002 Change (in thousands) 5 Times Square 1st Quarter 2002 $ 74,247 $ 57,807 $ 16,440 111 Huntington Avenue 2nd Quarter 2002 49,161 40,917 8,244 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1st Quarter 2003 4,614 2,542 2,072 Shaws Supermarket 2nd Quarter 2003 2,379 2,379 Broad Run Business Park 4th Quarter 2002 1,768 1,073 695 ITT Educational Services 1st Quarter 2002 820 713 107 Total $ 132,989 $ 103,052 $ 29,937 The overall increase in the remaining Same Property Portfolio reflects an increase in straight line rents of approximately $5.6 million resulting from increased free rent periods on renewals during 2003 as well as an increase in operating expense reimbursements related to higher operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental revenue, including operating income, parking and other income, of approximately $2.2 million and a slight decrease in occupancy. Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was related to nineteen tenants across the portfolio that terminated their leases and made termination payments totaling approximately $6.1 million. This compared to termination income earned for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to twenty three tenants totaling $6.8 million. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased by $2.5 million in the Total Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2003. Of the total variance, $1.0 million is a result of interest earned on a note receivable related to the sale of real estate in September 2002. In addition, during 2002 there was a one time refund of approximately $1.3 million, which related to the resolution of a prior year tax matter. 54 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio increased by $35.6 million. The additions of 399 Park Avenue, 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, One and Two Discovery Square and One and Two Freedom Square increased operating expenses by approximately $29.9 million, as described below: Operating Expenses for the year ended Property Date Acquired 2003 2002 Change (in thousands) 399 Park Avenue September 25, 2002 $ 33,195 $ 8,384 $ 24,811 One and Two Discovery Square April 1, 2003 1,939 1,939 One and Two Freedom Square August 5, 2003 2,498 2,498 1333 New Hampshire Ave October 8, 2003 640 640 Total Additions $ 38,272 $ 8,384 $ 29,888 The increases were offset by a decrease of $11.1 million related to One and Two Independence Square and 2300 N Street which were sold during 2002 and 2003, as well as the sale of Hilltop Office Center during 2004, all of which have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management of the properties. In addition, the continued lease up of 111 Huntington Avenue, Five Times Square and the additional properties detailed below contributed approximately $9.3 million of operating expenses: Operating Expenses for the year ended Property Date Placed inService 2003 2002 Change (in thousands) 5 Times Square 1st Quarter 2002 $ 13,697 $ 8,774 $ 4,923 111 Huntington Avenue 2nd Quarter 2002 15,221 12,684 2,537 Waltham Weston Corporate Center 1st Quarter 2003 2,022 1,096 926 Shaws Supermarket 2nd Quarter 2003 208 208 Broad Run Business Park 4th Quarter 2002 370 131 239 ITT Educational Services 1st Quarter 2002 74 54 20 611 Gateway Boulevard 3rd Quarter 2003 688 241 447 Total $ 32,280 $ 22,980 $ 9,300 Property operating expenses in the Same Property Portfolio increased during the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to increases in real estate taxes of $6.7 million, or 5.70%, and increases in insurance of $1.4 million, or 13.33%. The increases in real estate taxes are due to higher property tax assessments and rate increases, specifically in New York, which represented $5.1 million of the increase. Increases in insurance premiums in the Same Property Portfolio and Total Portfolio are related to increases in premium rates on existing coverage as well as the increased cost to purchase coverage under the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. Other decreases were mainly due to an overall decrease in occupancy from 93.9% at December 31, 2002 to 92.1% at December 31, 2003. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for the hotel properties decreased by $5.4 million or approximately 23.2% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. These decreases were due to the continued downturn experienced in business travel and the tourism industry in the Boston market. 55 Table of Contents The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for the three hotel properties for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 Decrease Occupancy 77.3 % 80.7 % (4.2 %) Average daily rate $ 166.40 $ 181.13 (8.1 %) Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 128.78 $ 146.25 (11.9 %) Development and Management Services The increase in development and management services income of $6.6 million primarily resulted from the recognition of fees in 2003 on certain third party development projects, some of which began in 2002, and an overall increase in management fees due to the continuing involvement in properties sold during 2003. Development fees increased by $2.8 million on the 90 Church Street project in New York City related to the services provided to remediate damages resulting from the events of September 11, 2001. There was an overall increase of $1.1 million in development fees in Washington, D.C. on the National Institute of Health and 901 New York Avenue projects. During 2003, approximately $1.8 million was recognized as development fees on the construction of the residential building, The Belvidere in Boston, MA. The remaining increases relate to new management agreements entered into with the sale of 2300 N Street and One and Two Independence Square for the year ended December 31, 2003. Our third party revenue is project specific and highly dependent on our ability to secure third party development contracts. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses in the Total Property Portfolio decreased during the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2002 by $1.9 million or 4.09%. A decrease of $2.8 million is related to the write off of unrecoverable leasing commissions related to our termination of the lease with Arthur Andersen for 620,947 square feet at the Times Square Tower during the second quarter of 2002. In addition, an increase of $2.2 million is attributed to changes in the form of equity based compensation, as further described below. In 2003, we issued restricted stock and or LTIP units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP units over a five year term. Restricted stock and LTIP units are measured at fair market value on the date of grant based on the number of shares or units granted and the closing price of our Common Stock on the date of grant as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to Stock based compensation. Stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock was $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2003. Stock based compensation associated with $6.1 million of restricted stock that was granted in January 2003 will generally be expensed ratably as such restricted stock vests over a five year vesting period. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $9.7 million of restricted stock and LTIP units that were granted in January 2004 will also be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP units vest. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Portfolio increased as a result of our strategic decision to replace our variable rate debt with primarily unsecured fixed rate debt and a decrease in the amount of capitalized interest on development projects which was instead expensed. This was primarily due to placing into service and cessation of interest capitalization on Five Times Square, 111 Huntington Avenue, Two Freedom Square, Shaws 56 Table of Contents Supermarket and 611 Gateway Boulevard and the issuance of $1.5 billion of unsecured fixed rate senior notes (including $750 million issued in December 2002). Our total debt outstanding at December 31, 2003 was approximately $5.0 billion compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2002. December 31, 2003 2002 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 4,566,188 $ 3,890,196 Variable rate 438,532 1,257,024 Total $ 5,004,720 $ 5,147,220 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 91.24 % 75.58 % Variable rate 8.76 % 24.42 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.67 % 7.17 % Variable rate 2.87 % 3.04 % Total 6.33 % 6.03 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased $30.3 million. Approximately $26.7 million of the increase was a result of the acquisition of 399 Park Avenue, One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square and 1333 New Hampshire Avenue, as well as the properties placed in service after January 1, 2002. The increases were offset by decreases of $4.3 million related to properties that were sold during 2002 and 2003 that were not classified as discontinued operations.

These costs are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, 57 Table of Contents property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $5.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $19.2 million and $22.5 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Net Derivative Losses Net derivative losses for the Total Portfolio represent the mark to market and cash settlements of our derivative contracts, consisting of interest rate swaps, payments that were not effective for accounting purposes. The fair value of our derivative contract, which was $8.2 million at December 31, 2003, is included within our consolidated balance sheets. As a result of to the expiration of this derivative contract in February 2005, we will have no further earnings volatility on the remaining derivative contract. See Part II Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Joint Ventures The decrease in income from unconsolidated joint ventures in the Total Portfolio as well as the Same Property Portfolio is related to the purchase of the remaining interests in One and Two Discovery Square, One and Two Freedom Square and 140 Kendrick Street. One and Two Discovery Square are included in the Total Portfolio Revenue as of April 1, 2003. One and Two Freedom Square are included in the Total Portfolio Revenue as of August 5, 2003. 140 Kendrick Street is included in the Total Portfolio as of March 24, 2004. The reclassification of these properties caused the overall income from joint ventures to decrease for the year ended December 31, 2003. Other The decrease in income from discontinued operations in the Total Portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2003 was a result of properties sold or designated as held for sale during the end of 2002 and beginning of 2003 which are no longer included as of December 31, 2003. Below is a list of properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: Year ended December 31, 2003 Year ended December 31, 2002 Sugarland Business Park Building One Sugarland Business Park Building One 204 Second Avenue 204 Second Avenue 560 Forbes Boulevard 560 Forbes Boulevard Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven Decoverly Two, Three, Six and Seven 38 Cabot Boulevard 38 Cabot Boulevard The Arboretum The Arboretum 430 Rozzi Place 430 Rozzi Place Sugarland Business Park Building Two Sugarland Business Park Building Two 875 Third Avenue 875 Third Avenue The Candler Building The Candler Building Fullerton Square 7600 Boston Boulevard 7700 Boston Boulevard 2391 West Winton Avenue Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2003 related to the sale of 2300 N Street in the first quarter for a gain of $52.9 million. In the second and third quarter, there was a transfer of certain mortgage issuance costs that resulted in a gain of $4.8 million (net of minority interest share of $1.0 million.) Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to the sale of One and Two Independence Square and were not included in discontinued operations as we have continuing involvement through a third party management agreement after the sale. 58 Table of Contents Properties included in gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 in the Total Portfolio are shown below: Year ended December 31, 2003 Date Disposed Year ended December 31, 2002 Date Disposed The Candler Building January 2003 Fullerton Square March 2002 875 Third Avenue February 2003 7600 Boston Boulevard March 2002 7700 Boston Boulevard March 2002 2391 West Winton Avenue December 2002 The decrease in our preferred dividend of $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 was a result of the conversion of 2,000,000 shares of our preferred stock into common stock in July 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service requirements including the repayment or refinancing of $564 million of indebtedness that matures within the twelve month period, $279 million of which is due in 2005 and the remainder in the first quarter of 2006; fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund current development costs not covered under construction loans; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We believe that these needs will be satisfied using our current cash balance, cash flows generated by operations and provided by financing activities. Rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, and other income from operations are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes. Our failure to comply with financial covenants could adversely impact our ability to access additional financing to fund our operations including distributions, debt service payments and capital expenditures. Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments, property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long term secured and unsecured indebtedness; income from operations; joint ventures; 59 Table of Contents sales of real estate; issuances of additional common and Preferred units of the Operating Partnership and or our equity securities; and our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short term bridge facilities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs. Our line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities and meet short term development needs. We fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by BPLP until project completion or lease up thresholds are achieved. In 2003, we completed three offerings of unsecured investment grade senior notes and expect to utilize the bond market, asset backed mortgage financing and common and preferred equity as cost effective capital sources for other long term capital needs. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in
