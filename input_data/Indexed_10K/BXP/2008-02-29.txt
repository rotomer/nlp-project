Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on managements beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward looking statements. We caution you that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include, among others, the following: general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully; 40 Table of Contents risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and or availability of financing; risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period to period comparisons of financial results; risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8 K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on Form 8 K or otherwise. Overview We are a fully integrated self administered and self managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space generally and general economic factors. We also generate cash through the sale of assets, which may be either non core assets or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors. The impact of the current state of the economy, including rising unemployment and constrained capital, on our company is unknown. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure to down cycles and, based on our current occupancy and recent 41 Table of Contents leasing success, lack of available supply in our markets and limited lease rollover, we believe we are well positioned to withstand a slowing economy. The state of the debt capital markets is continuing to deteriorate with many lenders, including CMBS providers, out of the market and others such as banks and life insurance companies tightening their credit standards and cautiously allocating capital. We believe our current liquidity, including our cash balances and the availability under our $605 million line of credit, is sufficient to meet our foreseeable capital needs and helps to insulate us from the difficulties in the capital markets. In fact, we believe that, given our strong balance sheet and liquidity, we will have opportunities to capitalize on the current environment and we intend to seek acquisitions of high quality real estate at attractive returns. Although we intend to pursue such acquisitions, we continue to believe that the returns we can generate from developments will be greater than those we can expect from acquisitions. Since the beginning of 2005 we have completed over $4.3 billion of asset sales and have redeployed a significant amount of the proceeds into our development pipeline. We started approximately $1.7 billion of developments in 2007, including commencing construction on our approximately 1.0 million square foot office tower in New York City at 250 West 55th Street and on our 815,000 square foot mixed use Russia Wharf development in Boston. We entered 2008 with an active development program of approximately $2.1 billion, and although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years and we currently do not have any assets on the market. We believe our focus on new development will enhance our long term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in service in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Update on Recent Regulatory Initiatives On August 31, 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued proposed FASB Staff Position No. APB 14 a Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (the proposed FSP) that would require the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The proposed FSP, if issued as currently contemplated, would require that the initial debt proceeds from the sale of Boston Properties Limited Partnerships (BPLP) $862.5 million of 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 and $450.0 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt. The resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period during which the debt is expected to be outstanding (i.e., through the first optional redemption dates) as additional non cash interest expense. The proposed FSP would be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and it would be applied retrospectively to BPLPs outstanding exchangeable senior notes for all periods presented. Based on our current understanding of the application of the proposed FSP, this would result in an aggregate of approximately $18 million (net of incremental capitalized interest) of additional non cash interest expense for fiscal 2008. Excluding the impact of capitalized interest, the additional non cash interest expense would be approximately $20 million to $22 million, and this amount (before netting) will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the first optional redemption dates as the debt accretes to its par value over the same period. There can be no assurance that the proposed FSP will be issued in the form currently contemplated by the FASB, or at all, and therefore its ultimate impact on our interest expense may differ materially from the aforementioned estimate. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is 42 Table of Contents possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above and below market leases, origination costs, acquired in place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (2) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, (SFAS No. 144) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date. 43 Table of Contents SFAS No. 144 requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary. Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. 44 Table of Contents Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenants creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; debt to market capitalization; and liquidity; evaluate the depth and experience of the tenants management team; and assess the strength/growth of the tenants industry. As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenants credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we: require a security deposit; and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenants credit is below our acceptable parameters. We maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenants inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1 4 with a rating of 1 representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of 4 representing the lowest credit rating, recording a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in place tenant leases was approximately 7.4 years as of December 31, 2007. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and frequent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 45 Table of Contents 99 19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or Issue 99 19. Issue 99 19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with Issue 99 19. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees on a straight line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above and below market leases, origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 139, 131 and 121 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period to period financial data with respect to the Total 46 Table of Contents Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio) and the changes attributable to the properties included in Properties Acquired, Sold, Repositioned and Placed in Service. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), minority interest in Operating Partnership, losses from early extinguishments of debt, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a propertys results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 102 properties, including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2006 and owned through December 31, 2007, totaling approximately 25.5 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2006 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2007. Properties Placed In Service includes our 505 9th Street joint venture project. In connection with partially placing this property in service, we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. The Same Property Portfolio includes our Cambride Center Marriott hotel property, but does not include the Long Wharf Marriott hotel property, which was sold on March 23, 2007. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in service, repositioned or sold. 47 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold PropertiesAcquired PropertiesPlacedIn Service PropertiesRepositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2007 2006 Increase/(Decrease) %Change 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Increase/(Decrease) %Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,196,883 $ 1,142,388 $ 54,495 4.77 % $ 21,902 $ 124,828 $ 48,940 $ 8,244 $ 32,313 $ 24,117 $ 27,199 $ 20,402 $ 1,327,237 $ 1,319,979 $ 7,258 0.55 % Termination Income 6,882 6,999 (117 ) (1.67 )% 1,138 100 6,982 8,137 (1,155 ) (14.19 )% Total Rental Revenue 1,203,765 1,149,387 54,378 4.73 % 21,902 125,966 49,040 8,244 32,313 24,117 27,199 20,402 1,334,219 1,328,116 6,103 0.50 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 419,054 389,872 29,182 7.49 % 6,369 35,439 14,964 2,239 7,995 4,731 7,458 5,424 455,840 437,705 18,135 4.14 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 784,711 759,515 25,196 3.32 % 15,533 90,527 34,076 6,005 24,318 19,386 19,741 14,978 878,379 890,411 (12,032 ) (1.35 )% Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 10,046 8,048 1,998 24.83 % 10,046 8,048 1,998 24.83 % Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 794,757 767,563 27,194 3.54 % 15,533 90,527 34,076 6,005 24,318 19,386 19,741 14,978 888,425 898,459 (10,034 ) (1.12 )% Other Revenue: Development and Management Services 20,553 19,820 733 3.70 % Interest and Other 89,706 36,677 53,029 144.58 % Total Other Revenue 110,259 56,497 53,762 95.16 % Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 69,882 59,375 10,507 17.70 % Interest Expense 285,887 298,260 (12,373 ) (4.15 )% Depreciation and amortization 246,016 238,585 7,431 3.11 % 2,767 18,049 24,155 3,531 8,731 7,365 4,361 3,032 286,030 270,562 15,468 5.72 % Loss from early extinguishments of debt 3,417 32,143 (28,726 ) (89.37 )% Total Other Expenses 246,016 238,585 7,431 3.11 % 2,767 18,049 24,155 3,531 8,731 7,365 4,361 3,032 645,216 660,340 (15,124 ) (2.29 )% Income before minority interests $ 548,741 $ 528,978 $ 19,763 3.74 % $ 12,766 $ 72,478 $ 9,921 $ 2,474 $ 15,587 $ 12,021 $ 15,380 $ 11,946 $ 353,468 $ 294,616 $ 58,852 19.98 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures $ 5,799 $ 7,230 $ (1,431 ) (19.79 )% $ 15,125 $ 17,455 $ (496 ) $ (178 ) $ $ $ $ 20,428 24,507 (4,079 ) (16.64 )% Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ $ $ $ 6,206 $ 16,104 $ $ $ $ $ $ 6,206 16,104 (9,898 ) (61.46 )% Minority interest in property partnership (84 ) 2,013 (2,097 ) (104.17 )% Minority interest in Operating Partnership (64,916 ) (69,999 ) 5,083 7.26 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 789,238 606,394 182,844 30.15 % Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 220,350 220,350 100.0 % Net Income available to common shareholders $ 1,324,690 $ 873,635 $ 451,055 51.63 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 47. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $37,811 and $33,014, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $27,765 and $24,966, respectively, per the Consolidated Income Statement. 48 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of approximately $7.3 million in the Total Property Portfolio Rental Revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $54.5 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $102.9 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $40.7 million, Properties Placed In Service increased approximately $8.2 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. We incur certain tenant specific property costs for which we are reimbursed from our tenants. Starting in 2007, we have included these reimbursements in rental revenue and included the tenant specific operating cost within real estate operating expenses. This income and expense classification in 2007 results in a presented increase to comparable rental revenue and real estate operating expenses, however does not impact our consolidated net operating income. For the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the rental income and real estate operating expense gross up was approximately $8.9 million and $12.0 million, respectively. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $39.1 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $7.3 million in straight line rents. Approximately $18.8 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which correlates with the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $3.9 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In Service relates to partially placing in service our 505 9th Street development project in the fourth quarter of 2007, placing in service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. Rental revenue from Properties Placed In Service increased approximately $8.2 million, as detailed below: Date Placed In Service Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Seven Cambridge Center First Quarter, 2006 $ 22,138 $ 19,939 $ 2,199 12290 Sunrise Valley Second Quarter, 2006 6,338 4,178 2,160 505 9th Street Fourth Quarter, 2007 3,837 3,837 Total $ 32,313 $ 24,117 $ 8,196 The acquisition of 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive, 103 Fourth Avenue, Kingstowne Towne Center, the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park in 2007, and 303 Almaden Boulevard, 3200 Zanker Road and Four and Five Cambridge Center in 2006, increased revenue from Properties Acquired by approximately $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as detailed below: Date Acquired Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Four and Five Cambridge Center November 30, 2006 $ 18,605 $ 1,265 $ 17,340 Kingstowne Towne Center March 30, 2007 10,631 10,631 3200 Zanker Road August 10, 2006 10,520 3,839 6,681 303 Almaden Boulevard June 30, 2006 6,402 3,140 3,262 Mountain View Properties November 27, 2007 1,275 1,275 103 Fourth Avenue January 29, 2007 720 720 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive January, 2007 685 685 North First Business Park December 13, 2007 102 102 Total $48,940 $8,244 $40,696 49 Table of Contents Rental revenue from Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased approximately $6.8 million over the year ended December 31, 2006. Our Capital Gallery expansion project is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In April 2006, tenants began to take occupancy and we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in service in July 2006. The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in 2006. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property through agreements entered into at the time of sale. Rental Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $102.9 million, as detailed below: Date Sold Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Democracy Center August 7, 2007 $ 12,016 $ 17,825 $ (5,809 ) 5 Times Square February 15, 2007 9,886 74,795 (64,909 ) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006 32,208 (32,208 ) Total $ 21,902 $ 124,828 $ (102,926 ) Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was related to multiple tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, and we recognized termination income totaling approximately $7.0 million. This compared to termination income of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We expect to recognize approximately $6 million of termination income for the year 2008. Real Estate Operating Expenses The $18.1 million increase in property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $29.2 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $29.1 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $12.7 million, Properties Placed In Service increased approximately $3.3 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $2.0 million. Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $2.5 million, which represents an increase of approximately 3% over the prior year to date. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $10.7 million due to increased real estate tax assessments and repairs and maintenance increased approximately $8.4 million. The remaining $7.6 million increase in the Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is related to an increase in cleaning contracts and other general and administrative items. 50 Table of Contents The acquisition of 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive, 103 Fourth Avenue, Kingstowne Towne Center, the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park in 2007, and 303 Almaden Boulevard, 3200 Zanker Road and Four and Five Cambridge Center in 2006, increased operating expenses from Properties Acquired by approximately $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as detailed below: Date Acquired Real Estate Operating Expensefor the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Four and Five Cambridge Center November 30, 2006 $ 6,871 $ 519 $ 6,352 Kingstowne Towne Center March 30, 2007 2,591 2,591 303 Almaden Boulevard June 30, 2006 2,345 1,223 1,122 3200 Zanker Road August 10, 2006 1,837 497 1,340 103 Fourth Avenue January 29, 2007 606 606 Mountain View Properties November 27, 2007 412 412 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive January, 2007 256 256 North First Business Park December 13, 2007 46 46 Total $ 14,964 $ 2,239 $ 12,725 The increase in operating expenses from Properties Placed In Service relates to partially placing in service our 505 9th Street development project in the fourth quarter of 2007, placing in service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006.

Our Capital Gallery expansion project is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In April 2006, tenants began to take occupancy and during July 2006, we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in service. A decrease of approximately $29.1 million in the Total Property Portfolio operating expenses was due to the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in 2006, as detailed below: Date Sold Real Estate Operating Expensesfor the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Democracy Center August 7, 2007 $ 4,204 $ 6,144 $ (1,940 ) 5 Times Square February 15, 2007 2,165 14,988 (12,823 ) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006 14,307 (14,307 ) Total $ 6,369 $ 35,439 $ (29,070 ) We continue to review and monitor the impact of rising energy costs, as well as other factors, on our operating budgets for fiscal year 2008. Because some operating expenses are not recoverable from tenants, an increase in operating expenses due to one or more of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 51 Table of Contents Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property increased approximately $2.0 million, a 24.8% increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the operations of the Long Wharf Marriott was included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on March 23, 2007. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 PercentageChange Occupancy 80.0 % 75.1 % 6.5 % Average daily rate $ 217.23 $ 194.52 11.7 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 173.80 $ 146.15 18.9 % Development and Management Services Development and Management Services income increased approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. We have maintained management contracts following the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on June 6, 2006 which contributed to an increase of approximately $1.1 million in management fees. A decrease of approximately $0.4 million was attributed to reduced work order income. We expect third party fee income for the year 2008 to be between $19 million and $20 million, a slight increase due to leasing and management fees we are projecting to earn at 280 Park Avenue as well as fees generated from the additional investment in the Value Added Fund. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. In February 2007, our Operating Partnership issued $862.5 million of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes. On February 15, 2007, we completed the sale of our long term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City for approximately $1.23 billion in cash. On March 23, 2007, we completed the sale of the Long Wharf Marriott for approximately $225.6 million in cash. On April 5, 2007, we completed the sale of Newport Office Park for approximately $33.7 million in cash. On August 7, 2007, we completed the sale of Democracy Center for approximately $184.5 million in cash and on November 20, 2007, we completed the sale of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park Building E properties for an aggregate of approximately $125.4 million in cash. We paid our special dividend and regular dividend payments totaling $6.66 per share on January 30, 2008. Our current cash balance, after the dividends and our purchase of the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park, is approximately $750 million. As the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, short term investment returns have decreased significantly and therefore we anticipate interest income to be between approximately $22 million to $25 million for the year 2008. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. An overall increase of approximately $2.6 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as well as an increase in long term compensation expense of approximately $3.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized 52 Table of Contents additional expenses related to abandoned project costs of approximately $4.5 million. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses to be between $74 million and $75 million for the year 2008. A significant portion of the expected increase results from the inclusion of the 2008 OPP Awards described below, which adds approximately $4.9 million in 2008. On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These awards (the 2008 OPP Awards) are part of a new broad based long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (TRS) over a three year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been allocated to date and were granted on February 5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants. We expect that under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share Based Payment the 2008 OPP Awards will have an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five year plan period (although awards for retirement eligible employees will be amortized over a three year period). Because the 2008 OPP Awards requires a sustained price target to achieve the threshold stock price, unless the target has actually been met by the end of the applicable reporting period, we will exclude all contingently issueable shares from the diluted EPS calculation. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four or five year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after November 2006, vesting will occur in equal annual installments over a four year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to "stock based compensation." Stock based compensation associated with approximately $27.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $18.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four year vesting period. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five year vesting period. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease is due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, which decreased interest expense by $11.2 million, (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, 191 Spring Street, 101 Carnegie Center, Seven Cambridge Center, Embarcadero Center Three and Embarcadero Center Four, 504, 506, 508 and 510 Carnegie Center Properties, which decreased interest expense 53 Table of Contents by approximately $15.9 million, and (3) an increase in capitalized interest costs which results in a decrease of interest expense of approximately $18.5 million. These decreases were offset by (1) an increase of approximately $4.4 million related to interest paid on the $450 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership at a per annum interest rate of 3.75%, (2) an increase of approximately $26.2 million related to interest paid on the $862.5 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2007 by our Operating Partnership at an effective per annum interest rate of 3.438% and (3) an increase of approximately $4.3 million related to the acquisition of Kingstowne Towne Center on March 30, 2007 as well as the consolidation of our 505 9th joint venture property due to the involvement we now have because the property is operational. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt. At December 31, 2007, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at South of Market. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006: December 31, 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,369,243 $ 3,889,447 Variable rate 122,923 711,490 Total $ 5,492,166 $ 4,600,937 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 97.76 % 84.54 % Variable rate 2.24 % 15.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.58 % 6.19 % Variable rate 6.11 % 5.80 % Total 5.60 % 6.13 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $20.6 million related to the 2007 acquisitions compared with the 2006 activity, approximately $0.7 million related to partially placing in service 505 9th Street in the fourth quarter of 2007, approximately $1.3 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter of 2006, and approximately $0.7 million was due to the placing in service of our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 compared with 280 Park Avenue in 2006, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $15.3 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $11.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and 54 Table of Contents administrative expenses discussed above. We expect capitalized wages to increase proportionately with our increased development activity and increased wages into 2008. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $31.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Losses from early extinguishments of debt On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August 7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment.

Approximately $0.5 million of the increase related to tenant improvement construction management fees earned, the majority of which was in San Francisco. An increase in development income of approximately $0.4 million was due to the increasing development activity at our 505 9th Street joint venture project. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. During the second quarter of 2006, we issued $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On June 6, 2006, we completed the sale of 280 Park Avenue for net cash proceeds of approximately $875 million. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2006, including 280 Park Avenue and 265 Franklin Street. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. An overall increase of approximately $4.7 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 and approximately $1.5 million related to tax savings during 2005. These increases were offset by approximately $2.1 million of decreased accounting and legal related expenses, and other overall decreases aggregating approximately $0.2 million. Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees generally vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five year term (for awards granted prior to 2003, vesting is in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 through 2006, vesting occurs over a five year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted in 2007, vesting will occur in equal annual installments over a four year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and all subsequent LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock based compensation. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $11.4 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2005 and approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The majority of the decreases are due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street in the second quarter of 2005, and Embarcadero Center West Tower in October 2005, which collectively decreased interest expense by $20.4 million and (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, Montvale Center, 101 Carnegie Center, 191 Spring Street and 601 and 651 Gateway Boulevard, which decreased interest expense approximately $8.2 million. These decreases were offset by (1) increases of 62 Table of Contents approximately $8.6 million at Times Square Tower due to increasing interest rates (5.85% on December 31, 2006 and 4.87% on December 31, 2005) and the increased principal balance due to the refinancing of the mortgage loan in June 2005, (2) an increase of approximately $12.3 million related to interest paid on the $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership and (3) a net increase of approximately $1.2 million due to the interest imputed on the unpaid redemption price related to the redemption of the outside members equity interest at Citigroup Center to reflect the fair value of debt as well as the impact of placing Seven Cambridge Center into service prior to the repayment of debt. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt. At December 31, 2006, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at Times Square Tower, South of Market and our secured borrowings under our unsecured line of credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2006 compared with December 31, 2005: December 31, 2006 2005 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,889,447 $ 3,952,151 Variable rate 711,490 874,103 Total $ 4,600,937 $ 4,826,254 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 84.54 % 81.89 % Variable rate 15.46 % 18.11 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.19 % 6.61 % Variable rate 5.80 % 4.96 % Total 6.13 % 6.31 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $7.3 million due to the placing in service of our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006, approximately $6.8 million related to the acquisition of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 303 Almaden Boulevard on June 30, 2006, 3200 Zanker Road on August 10, 2006 and Four and Five Cambridge Center in November 2006, and approximately $1.4 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and Embarcadero Center West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $14.2 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other 63 Table of Contents project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $7.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Losses from early extinguishments of debt For the year ended December 31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In connection with the legal defeasance of the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries and the principal balance of the mortgage loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our Seven Cambridge Center property. The construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We repaid the construction and permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million comprised of a prepayment penalty and the write off of unamortized deferred finance costs. During 2006, we also repaid the mortgage loan collateralized by our Embarcadero Center Three property located in San Francisco, California totaling approximately $133.4 million, the mortgage loan collateralized by our 191 Spring Street property located in Lexington, Massachusetts totaling approximately $17.9 million, the mortgage loan collateralized by our Montvale Center property located in Gaithersburg, Maryland totaling approximately $6.6 million and the mortgage loan collateralized by our 101 Carnegie Center property located in Princeton, New Jersey totaling approximately $6.6 million. There were no significant prepayment penalties or write offs of unamortized deferred financing costs related to these repayments. In connection with the sales of 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in May 2005, we repaid the mortgage loans collateralized by the properties totaling approximately $188 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $11.0 million, consisting of prepayment fees of approximately $10.8 million and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. We also recognized a $1.9 million loss from early extinguishment of debt, which relates to the refinancing of our Times Square Tower mortgage loan and the modification on our Unsecured Line of Credit. Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures On September 15, 2006, a joint venture in which we had a 35% interest sold 265 Franklin Street located in Boston, Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $170.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $108.3 million, of which our share was approximately $37.9 million, after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of approximately $60.8 million and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs of approximately $0.9 million. The venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $51.4 million, of which our share was approximately $18.0 million, and a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million, of which our share was $0.1 million. Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run, Building E, Long Wharf Marriott and Newport Office Park were included as part of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest. Properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of the Orbital Science Campus, Broad Run, Building E, Long Wharf Marriott, Newport Office Park, 40 46 Harvard Street, the Residence Inn by Marriott and Old Federal Reserve. 64 Table of Contents Minority interest in property partnership Minority interest in property partnership consists of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption of the minority interest holders interest at Citigroup Center on May 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership will no longer reflect an allocation to the minority interest holder. Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 payable on January 30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2006. In connection with the special cash distribution declared in July 2005, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as converted basis in connection with their regular February 2006 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.1 million, which amount is reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2005. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minority interest in our Operating Partnerships income allocation related to an underlying increase in allocable income. Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest On June 6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue, a 1,179,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in midtown Manhattan, New York, for approximately $1.2 billion. Net proceeds totaled approximately $875 million after legal defeasance of indebtedness secured by the property (consisting of approximately $254.4 million of principal indebtedness and approximately $28.2 million of related defeasance costs) and the payment of transfer taxes, brokers fees and other customary closing costs. We recognized at closing a gain on sale of approximately $583.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $109.2 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. In January 2006, we recognized a $4.8 million gain (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.9 million) on the sale of a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts which had been accounted for previously as a financing transaction. During January 2006, the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes. Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio primarily relate to the sales of Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Street which are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties after the sales. In addition, the sale of Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland are included in gains on sales of real estate and other assets for the year ended December 31, 2005. Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. 65 Table of Contents Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Old Federal Reserve in April 2005, Residence Inn by Marriott and 40 46 Harvard Street, both which were sold in November 2005. Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. At December 31, 2005, we recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund current development costs not covered under construction loans; fund the costs associated with the settlement of our hedge agreements at maturity; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. On December 17, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $5.98 per common share that was paid on January 30, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2007. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2007, including 5 Times Square, Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run Business Park Building E, Worldgate Plaza and Newport Office Park. The Board of Directors did not make any change in our policy with respect to regular quarterly dividends. The payment of the regular quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and the special dividend of $5.98 per share resulted in a total payment of $6.66 per share paid on January 30, 2008. We believe that our liquidity needs during 2008, including approximately $451.0 million of estimated development costs, will be satisfied using our approximately $750 million of cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our line of credit (currently $582.9 million) and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We may also generate cash from asset sales. Base rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our unsecured line of credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. 66 Table of Contents We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes. Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments, possible property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); income from operations; income from joint ventures; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in BPLP; and our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short term bridge facilities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs. Our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by BPLP, our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease up thresholds are achieved. To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then current and anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in
