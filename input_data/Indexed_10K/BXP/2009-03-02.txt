Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on managements beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward looking statements. We caution you that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include, among others, the following: the impact of the current credit crisis and global economic slowdown, which is having and may continue to have a negative effect on the following, among other things: the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy and rental rates; the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms, our lenders, counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and institutions that hold our cash balances and short term investments, which may expose us to increased risks of default by these parties; our ability to obtain debt financing on attractive terms or at all, which may adversely impact our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt and our future interest expense; and the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis; general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully; the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); 45 Table of Contents risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and or availability of financing; risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period to period comparisons of financial results; risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks set forth above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8 K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8 K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward looking statements after the date of this report. Overview We are a fully integrated self administered and self managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, DC, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space generally and general economic factors. We also generate cash through the sale of assets, which may be either non core assets or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors. The impact of the current state of the economy, including rising unemployment, constrained capital and the deleveraging of the financial system, continues to have a dampening effect on the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy and rental rates. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply 46 Table of Contents constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure to down cycles, but if major tenants in our markets come under financial pressure and do not utilize all of their space it will likely lead to increased supply through subletting or tenant defaults and a corresponding reduction in market rental rates. We are also not immune from the impact of the credit crisis and global economic slowdown on our own tenants and our investments. During the third quarter of 2008, Lehman Brothers, Inc., our tenth largest tenant, filed for bankruptcy protection and we established a reserve for its related accrued straight line rent balance of $13.2 million. Lehman Brothers must continue to pay its rent while it occupies the space, but it may reject its lease at any time. There can be no assurance whether and for how long Lehman Brothers will continue to occupy this space. Lehman Brothers rent contributes approximately $43.0 million per year to our revenues. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized aggregate non cash impairment charges which represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. The joint ventures include the entities that own 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55th Street, the Value Added Fund and our Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. More generally, we remain concerned about the financial stress that our current and prospective tenants face. We believe that tenant defaults will continue and that, in general, demand for office space will decrease due to significant job losses in the financial and professional services industries and that market rents will be under pressure for the foreseeable future. In part as a result of these market conditions, on February 6, 2009, we announced our intention to suspend construction on our development at 250 West 55th Street in New York City because we were not able to conclude a lease transaction with a major law firm with which we had been negotiating over the last year. Agreement on financial terms had been reached with the firm within the last year, but recently the law firm informed us that it could not proceed on those terms thereby rendering the project economically infeasible in todays environment. The project, a one million square foot office building, was originally scheduled for completion in 2011. As a result of the decision to suspend construction at 250 West 55 th Street, we expect to reduce our capital commitments on the project through 2011 by approximately $450 million. After suspension of the 250 West 55th Street project, our development program will be approximately $1.4 billion and is 75% pre leased to tenants. As of December 31, 2008, we had invested approximately $483.2 million in our current active developments (i.e., excluding 250 West 55th Street) and, in addition to anticipated proceeds from existing construction loan facilities, we expect to make additional investments of approximately $822.9 million over the next four years. Recently we have witnessed a reduction in construction materials and labor pricing, which may reduce our total project costs, although there can be no assurance in this regard. As of December 31, 2008, we had $241.5 million in cash and $884.4 million in availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and anticipate funding the development projects through a combination of this existing liquidity supplemented by new construction loan facilities and or the incurrence of additional secured or unsecured debt. While we successfully utilized an accordion feature under our Unsecured Line of Credit to increase the lenders total commitment under the facility to $1.0 billion in July 2008, completed an offering of $747.5 million of exchangeable senior notes in August 2008 and completed a $375.0 million financing of Embarcadero Center Four in November 2008, many of the debt capital markets that real estate companies like us frequently access, such as the unsecured bond market and the convertible debt market, are not currently available to us on terms that we believe are economically attractive. In addition, other capital sources such as the traditional banks, pension funds and life insurance companies are lending fewer dollars, under stricter terms and at greater costs to the borrowers. Despite these challenges, we believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet align ourselves well with the lenders current investment selectivity and should enable us to access the credit markets even in the current difficult environment. Because capital may continue to be constrained, however, we are also evaluating the appropriate amount and form of distributions for 2009. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. 47 Table of Contents We believe the successful lease up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in service in 2009, 2010 and 2011. As with all aspects of our business, however, we continue to monitor the impact of the global economic slowdown and may further adjust our development plans accordingly. We do not anticipate undertaking any new development projects in the foreseeable future without significant pre leasing commitments from creditworthy tenants. Our focus on acquisition activity has moderated, but we continue to actively monitor the market and seek opportunities to selectively acquire high quality real estate at attractive returns. Finally, in recent years, we have been an active seller of real estate assets and, although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years. For descriptions of significant transactions that we entered into during 2008, see Item 1. Business Transactions During 2008. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above and below market leases, origination costs, acquired in place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (2) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of 48 Table of Contents lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, (SFAS No. 144) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. SFAS No. 144, requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We begin the capitalization of costs during the pre construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these 49 Table of Contents entities. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in the entitys governance, the size of our investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying values has occurred and such decline is other than temporary. The ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary. During December 2008, we recognized non cash impairment charges which represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. Unlike SFAS No. 144, potential impairments under APB No. 18 result from fair values derived based on discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques which are more sensitive to current market conditions. As a result, we recognized non cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55th Street and the Value Added Fund, respectively. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non cash impairment charges in accordance with APB No. 18), which represented our share of land and air rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre development costs. The combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. 50 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $5.4 million of rental revenue representing the adjustments of rents from above and below market leases in accordance with SFAS No. 141. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the impact of the straight line rent adjustment was approximately a $24.5 million increase in rental revenue. The straight line adjustment for the year included an approximately $21.0 million decrease due to the establishment of reserves for the full amount of the accrued straight line rent balances associated with our leases in New York City with Lehman Brothers, Inc. and the law firm of Heller Ehrman LLP. Amounts exclude SFAS No. 141 and straight line income from unconsolidated joint ventures, which is disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenants creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; revenue; cash flows; leverage: and liquidity; evaluate the depth and experience of the tenants management team; and assess the strength/growth of the tenants industry. As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenants credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we: require a security deposit; and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenants credit is below our acceptable parameters. We consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenants inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1 through 4. A rating of 1 represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded. A rating of 4 represents the lowest credit rating, in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. 51 Table of Contents If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in place tenant leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.2 years as of December 31, 2008. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99 19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or (Issue 99 19). Issue 99 19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with Issue 99 19. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above and below market leases, origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. 52 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivatives effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. We recognized net derivative losses of approximately $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 (See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 147, 139 and 131 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period to period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio) and the changes attributable to the properties included in Properties Acquired, Sold, Repositioned and Placed in Service. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus minority interest in Operating Partnership, losses from early extinguishments of debt, losses from investments in securities, net derivative losses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interests in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a propertys results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by 53 Table of Contents us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 115 properties, including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2007 and owned through December 31, 2008, totaling approximately 28.9 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2007 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2008. Properties Placed In Service includes our 505 9th Street joint venture project. In connection with partially placing this property in service, we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. The Same Property Portfolio includes our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property, but does not include the Long Wharf Marriott hotel property, which was sold on March 23, 2007. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in service, repositioned or sold. 54 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio PropertiesSold PropertiesAcquired PropertiesPlacedIn Service PropertiesRepositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2008 2007 Increase/(Decrease) %Change 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 Increase/(Decrease) %Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,326,099 $ 1,288,085 $ 38,014 2.95 % $ 90 $ 23,177 $ 20,137 $ 12,138 $ 43,283 $ 3,837 $ $ $ 1,389,609 $ 1,327,237 $ 62,372 4.70 % Termination Income 12,443 6,882 5,561 80.80 % 100 12,443 6,982 5,461 78.22 % Total Rental Revenue 1,338,542 1,294,967 43,575 3.36 % 90 23,177 20,137 12,238 43,283 3,837 1,402,052 1,334,219 67,833 5.08 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 471,040 444,364 26,676 6.00 % 46 6,781 6,406 3,499 10,538 1,196 488,030 455,840 32,190 7.06 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 867,502 850,603 16,899 1.99 % 44 16,396 13,731 8,739 32,745 2,641 914,022 878,379 35,643 4.06 % Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 9,362 10,046 (684 ) (6.80 )% 9,362 10,046 (684 ) (6.80 )% Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 876,864 860,649 16,215 1.88 % 44 16,396 13,731 8,739 32,745 2,641 923,384 888,425 34,959 3.93 % Other Revenue: Development and Management Services 30,518 20,553 9,965 48.48 % Interest and Other 18,958 89,706 (70,748 ) (78.87 )% Total Other Revenue 49,476 110,259 (60,783 ) (55.13 )% Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 72,365 69,882 2,483 3.55 % Interest Expense 271,972 285,887 (13,915 ) (4.87 )% Depreciation and amortization 284,452 274,268 10,184 3.71 % 2,767 10,527 8,357 9,168 638 304,147 286,030 18,117 6.33 % Losses from investments in securities 4,604 4,604 100.00 % Net derivative losses 17,021 17,021 100.00 % Loss from early extinguishments of debt 3,417 (3,417 ) (100.00 )% Total Other Expenses 284,452 274,268 10,184 3.71 % 2,767 10,527 8,357 9,168 638 670,109 645,216 24,893 3.86 % Income before minority interests $ 592,412 $ 586,381 $ 6,031 1.03 % $ 44 $ 13,629 $ 3,204 $ 382 $ 23,577 $ 2,003 $ $ $ 302,751 $ 353,468 $ (50,717 ) (14.35 )% Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures $ (33,794 ) $ 20,428 $ (54,222 ) (265.43 )% $ $ $ (148,224 ) $ $ $ $ $ (182,018 ) 20,428 (202,446 ) (991.02 )% Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 6,206 $ $ $ $ $ $ 6,206 (6,206 ) (100.00 )% Minority interests in property partnerships (1,997 ) (84 ) (1,913 ) (2,277.38 )% Minority interest in Operating Partnerships (22,006 ) (64,916 ) 42,910 66.10 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 28,502 789,238 (760,736 ) (96.39 )% Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 220,350 (220,350 ) (100.00 )% Net Income available to common shareholders $ 125,232 $ 1,324,690 $ (1,199,458 ) (90.55 )% (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 53. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $36,872 and $37,811, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $27,510 and $27,765, respectively, per the Consolidated Income Statement. 55 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of approximately $62.4 million in the Total Property Portfolio Rental Revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within four categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $38.0 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $23.1 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $8.0 million and Properties Placed In Service increased approximately $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately $49.2 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $30.9 million in straight line rents. An aggregate of $21.0 million of the decrease in straight line rent is due to the establishment of reserves for the full amount of the accrued straight line rent balances associated with our leases in New York City with Lehman Brothers, Inc. and the law firm of Heller Ehrman LLP. Approximately $17.3 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which relates to the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $2.4 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income. We expect the aggregate impact of straight line rents for fiscal 2009 to be between $28 million and $30 million. Lehman Brothers, Inc. contributes approximately $43.0 million per year to our rental revenue. In the event that Lehman Brothers, Inc. rejects its lease and vacates its space, we will lose this revenue until we are able to lease this space to a new tenant. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In Service relates to fully placing in service our 505 9th Street development project in the first quarter of 2008 and our 77 CityPoint and South of Market development projects during the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, we partially placed in service our One Preserve Parkway development project during the second quarter of 2008. Rental Revenue from Properties Placed In Service increased approximately $39.5 million, as detailed below: Property Date Placed In Service Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 2008 2007 Change (in thousands) 505 9th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 20,090 $ 3,837 $ 16,253 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 20,010 20,010 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 2,098 2,098 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2008 1,085 1,085 Total $ 43,283 $ 3,837 $ 39,446 The acquisitions of Kingstowne Towne Center, North First Business Park, 103 Fourth Avenue, 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive and Springfield Metro Center during 2007 and 635 Massachusetts Avenue during 2008, resulted in an increase of revenue from Properties Acquired.

These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property and our continued ownership interest in Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park.

This compared to termination income of $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Real Estate Operating Expenses The $32.2 million increase in property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within four categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $26.7 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $6.7 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $2.9 million and Properties Placed In Service increased approximately $9.3 million. Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $5.7 million, which represents an increase of approximately 7% over the prior year. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $14.2 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, which represents an increase of approximately 8%. The remaining increase of approximately $6.8 million is related to repairs and maintenance and other property related expenses. The acquisitions of Kingstowne Towne Center, North First Business Park, 103 Fourth Avenue, 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive and Springfield Metro Center during 2007, and 635 Massachusetts Avenue during 2008, increased operating expenses from Properties Acquired by approximately $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Real Estate Operating Expensefor the year ended December 31 2008 2007 Change Kingstowne Towne Center March 30, 2007 $ 3,808 $ 2,591 $ 1,217 North First Business Park December 13, 2007 1,138 46 1,092 103 Fourth Avenue January 29, 2007 759 606 153 635 Massachusetts Avenue September 26, 2008 274 274 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive January 18, 2007 239 167 72 Springfield Metro Center April 11, 2007 188 89 99 Total $ 6,406 $ 3,499 $ 2,907 57 Table of Contents The increase in operating expenses from Properties Placed In Service relates to fully placing in service our 505 9th Street development project in the first quarter of 2008 and our 77 CityPoint and South of Market development projects during the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, we partially placed in service our One Preserve Parkway development project during the second quarter of 2008.

Because some operating expenses are not recoverable from tenants, an increase in operating expenses due to one or more of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property decreased approximately $0.7 million, a 6.80% decrease for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the operations of the Long Wharf Marriott have been included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on March 23, 2007. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: 2008 2007 PercentageChange Occupancy 77.7 % 80.0 % (2.88 )% Average daily rate $ 217.70 $ 217.23 0.21 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 169.08 $ 173.80 (2.72 )% 58 Table of Contents Development and Management Services Development and Management Services income increased approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase is primarily attributed to $2 million of acquisition fees and approximately $3.8 million of ongoing management fees from our joint ventures that acquired the General Motors Building, 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower and 125 West 55th Street in New York City, as well as development fees of approximately $2.5 million for our 20 F Street third party development project. We expect third party fee income for fiscal 2009 to be between $28 million and $30 million, a modest decrease due to the completion of much of our joint venture development activity in 2008 and an expected reduction in tenant services income. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased by approximately $70.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of lower overall interest rates and decreased cash balances. The approximate average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $450.0 million and $1.7 billion, respectively. In addition, the average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 decreased by approximately 2.80%. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. The increase is primarily due to compensation expense associated with the 2008 OPP Awards offset by a loss in our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in abandoned project costs. We anticipate our general & administrative expense to be between $76 million and $78 million for fiscal 2009. Our decision to suspend development of 250 West 55th Street in New York City may result in additional potential costs related to our one existing signed lease, possible write offs of leasing commissions, arrangements in place with contractors and subcontractors for the project and other possible costs which we are currently evaluating. On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These 2008 OPP Awards are part of a new broad based long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (TRS) over a three year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. Assuming no changes in the aggregate annual per share dividend through February 2011, our common stock price would have to exceed $104.15 per share for recipients of 2008 OPP Awards to be eligible to earn any rewards. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been allocated to date and were granted on February 5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share Based Payment the 2008 OPP Awards have an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five year plan period (although awards for retirement eligible employees will be amortized over a three year period). Because the 2008 OPP Awards requires a sustained price target to achieve the threshold stock price, unless the target has 59 Table of Contents actually been met by the end of the applicable reporting period, we will exclude all contingently issueable shares from the diluted EPS calculation. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commencing in 2003, we began issuing restricted stock and or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four or five year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after November 2006, vesting occurs in equal annual installments over a four year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock based compensation. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $27.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $18.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four year vesting period. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five year vesting period. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007 as detailed below Transaction Interest Expensefor the year ended December 31, 2008 2007 Change (in thousands) Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgages(1) $ 18,682 $ 48,603 $ (29,921 ) Increase in capitalized interest costs (41,883 ) (31,036 ) (10,847 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other 191,433 198,357 (6,924 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ 168,232 $ 215,924 $ (47,692 ) Increases to interest expense due to: Refinancing of 599 Lexington Avenue and other new debt $ 57,738 $ 40,863 $ 16,875 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of exchangeable senior notes 39,440 26,231 13,209 Borrowings under the Unsecured Line of Credit 6,562 2,869 3,693 Total increases to interest expense $ 103,740 $ 69,963 $ 33,777 Total interest expense $ 271,972 $ 285,887 $ (13,915 ) (1) Excludes refinancing of 599 Lexington Avenue. On May 9, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14 1 Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (FSP No. APB 14 1). This pronouncement and the estimated effect that it will have on interest expense is discussed in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Newly Issued Accounting Standards. We expect interest expense to increase for fiscal 2009 due to the estimated impact of FSP No. APB 14 1 and the suspension of construction at 250 West 55th Street. We expect that our decision to suspend development of 250 West 55th Street in New York City will result in a decrease in capitalized interest and a corresponding incremental increase in interest expense of approximately $5 million to $9 million for fiscal 2009. 60 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loans at South of Market, Democracy Tower (formerly South of Market Phase II) and Wisconsin Place Office construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007: December 31, 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,886,424 $ 5,369,243 Variable rate 385,492 122,923 Total $ 6,271,916 $ 5,492,166 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 93.85 % 97.76 % Variable rate 6.15 % 2.24 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.36 % 5.58 % Variable rate 3.62 % 6.11 % Total 5.25 % 5.60 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Approximately $10.2 million related to an increase in the Same Property Portfolio and approximately $2.2 million related to acquisition activity. An increase of approximately $8.5 million was attributed to Properties Placed In Service. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $2.8 million due to the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 5 Times Square in February 2007. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $12.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $41.9 million and $31.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Due to the suspension of construction at 250 West 55th Street late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2009, we expect our 2009 capitalized interest will decrease by approximately $5 million to $9 million and our 2009 capitalized wages will decrease by a modest amount. Net Derivative Losses On September 9, 2008, we executed an interest rate lock agreement with lenders at an all in fixed rate, inclusive of the credit spread, of 6.10% per annum for an eight year, $375.0 million loan collateralized by our Four Embarcadero Center property located in San Francisco, California. Our interest rate hedging program contemplated a financing with a ten year term and, as a result, under SFAS No. 133, during the third quarter of 61 Table of Contents 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $6.6 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of our interest rate contracts. On November 13, 2008, we closed on the Four Embarcadero Center mortgage. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which amounts represent the effective portion of the applicable interest rate hedging contracts. Our interest rate hedging program also contemplated obtaining additional financing of at least $150.0 million by the end of 2008. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, we determined that we would be unable to complete the financing by the required date under our hedging program. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $7.2 million representing the ineffectiveness of our remaining interest rate hedging contracts. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we modified the estimated dates with respect to our anticipated financings under our interest rate hedging program. As a result, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $3.3 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. Losses from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. At December 31, 2008, investment in securities is comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund. The investment was previously included in Cash and Cash Equivalents. In December 2007, the fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors may elect in kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities mature or are liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we expect to retain this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment is subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund are now valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized losses of approximately $1.4 million and $0.3 million on our investment during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also maintain a deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow our officers to defer a portion of their current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals. Our obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we have balances of approximately $6.6 million and $8.3 million, respectively, into a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use. We recognized income (losses) of approximately $(3.2) million and $0.3 million on the investments in the account associated with our deferred compensation plan during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. In 2007, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August 7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment 62 Table of Contents fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.7 million consisting of the prepayment fee and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures For the year ended December 31, 2008, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $202.4 million compared to December 31, 2007. During December 2008, we recognized non cash impairment charges which represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of the Companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. As a result, we recognized non cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55th Street and the Value Added Fund, respectively. If the fair value of our investments deteriorate further, we could recognize additional impairment charges which may be material. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non cash impairment charges in accordance with APB No. 18), which represented our share of land and air rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre development costs. On June 9, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the General Motors Building for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion. On August 12, 2008, we completed the acquisitions of 540 Madison Avenue and Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $705.0 million. On August 13, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 125 West 55th Street located in New York City, New York for an aggregate price of $444.0 million. Each acquisition was completed through a joint venture with US Real Estate Opportunities I, L.P. and Meraas Capital LLC. We have a 60% interest in each venture and provide customary property management and leasing services for each venture. 63 Table of Contents The following table presents actual financial information for the joint ventures for the period ended December 31, 2008 for the General Motors Building and 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower and 125 West 55th Street, respectively.

We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale estimated to total $23.4 million has been deferred and will be recognized over the project construction period generally, based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2008 of approximately $8.5 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $1.4 million). On August 7, 2007, we sold Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for approximately $280.5 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $184.5 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of approximately $94.6 million and closing costs of approximately $1.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $168.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $29.9 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. As of August 31, 2008, we no longer provide management services for this building. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 is approximately $67.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we signed new qualifying leases for approximately 17,454 and 22,250 net rentable square feet of the remaining master lease obligation, resulting in the recognition of approximately $20.0 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $3.4 million) and $15.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $2.6 million) of additional gain on sale of real estate, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining master lease obligation totaled approximately $0.9 million. On February 15, 2007, we sold the long term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City and related credits, for approximately $1.28 billion in cash. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $1.23 billion, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $605.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $108.1 million).

The Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E properties are comprised of three Class A office properties aggregating approximately 337,000 net rentable square feet and an office/technical property totaling approximately 127,000 net rentable square feet, respectively. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $125.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $46.5 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $8.5 million). On April 5, 2007, we sold Newport Office Park, an approximately 172,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Quincy, Massachusetts, for approximately $37.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled 65 Table of Contents approximately $33.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $11.5 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $2.1 million.)

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 102 properties, including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2006 and owned through December 31, 2007, totaling approximately 25.5 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2006 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2007. Properties Placed In Service includes our 505 9th Street joint venture project. In connection with partially placing this property in service, we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. The Same Property Portfolio includes our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property, but does not include the Long Wharf Marriott hotel property, which was sold on March 23, 2007.

We have maintained management contracts following the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007, as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on June 6, 2006, which in the aggregate contributed to an increase of approximately $1.1 million in management fees. A decrease of approximately $0.4 million was attributed to reduced work order income. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. In February 2007, our Operating Partnership issued $862.5 million of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes. On February 15, 2007, we completed the sale of our long term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City for approximately $1.23 billion in cash. On March 23, 2007, we completed the sale of the Long Wharf Marriott for approximately $225.6 million in cash. On April 5, 2007, we completed the sale of Newport Office Park for approximately $33.7 million in cash. On August 7, 2007, we completed the sale of Democracy Center for approximately $184.5 million in cash and on November 20, 2007, we completed the sale of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park Building E properties for an aggregate of approximately $125.4 million in cash. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. An overall increase of approximately $2.6 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as well as an increase in long term compensation expense of approximately $3.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized additional expenses related to abandoned project costs of approximately $4.5 million. Commencing in 2003, we began issuing restricted stock and or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four or five year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after 71 Table of Contents November 2006, vesting occurs in equal annual installments over a four year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock based compensation. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $27.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $18.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four year vesting period. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five year vesting period. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease is due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, which decreased interest expense by $11.2 million, (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, 191 Spring Street, 101 Carnegie Center, Seven Cambridge Center, Embarcadero Center Three and Embarcadero Center Four, and our 504, 506, 508 and 510 Carnegie Center properties, which decreased interest expense by approximately $15.9 million, and (3) an increase in capitalized interest costs which results in a decrease of interest expense of approximately $18.5 million. These decreases were offset by (1) an increase of approximately $4.4 million related to interest paid on the $450 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership at a per annum interest rate of 3.75%, (2) an increase of approximately $26.2 million related to interest paid on the $862.5 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2007 by our Operating Partnership at an effective per annum interest rate of 3.438% and (3) an increase of approximately $4.3 million related to the acquisition of Kingstowne Towne Center on March 30, 2007 as well as the consolidation of our 505 9th joint venture property due to the involvement we now have because the property is operational. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt. At December 31, 2007, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at South of Market. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006: December 31, 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,369,243 $ 3,889,447 Variable rate 122,923 711,490 Total $ 5,492,166 $ 4,600,937 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 97.76 % 84.54 % Variable rate 2.24 % 15.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.58 % 6.19 % Variable rate 6.11 % 5.80 % Total 5.60 % 6.13 % 72 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $20.6 million related to the 2007 acquisitions compared with the 2006 activity, approximately $0.7 million related to partially placing in service 505 9th Street in the fourth quarter of 2007, approximately $1.3 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter of 2006, and approximately $0.7 million was due to the placing in service of Seven Cambridge Center in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 compared with 280 Park Avenue in 2006, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $15.3 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $11.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $31.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August 7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.7 million consisting of the prepayment fee and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. For the year ended December 31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In connection with the legal defeasance of the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries and the principal balance of the mortgage loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our Seven Cambridge Center property. The construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty 73 Table of Contents associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We repaid the construction and permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million comprised of a prepayment penalty and the write off of unamortized deferred finance costs. Income from unconsolidated joint ventures For the year ended December 31, 2007, income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $4.1 million. On June 1, 2007, our Value Added Fund sold Worldgate Plaza located in Herndon, Virginia for approximately $109.0 million. Worldgate Plaza is an office complex consisting of approximately 322,000 net rentable square feet. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $50.5 million, of which our share was approximately $20.3 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of $57.0 million. Our share of the gain, which is included as income from joint ventures, was approximately $15.5 million which amount reflects the achievement of certain return thresholds as provided for in the joint venture agreement. On October 1, 2007, our 505 9th Street joint venture project, a 323,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Washington, D.C was partially placed in service. In connection with partially placing this property in service, we consolidated this entity as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. On September 15, 2006, a joint venture in which we had a 35% interest sold 265 Franklin Street located in Boston, Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $170.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $108.3 million, of which our share was approximately $37.9 million, after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of approximately $60.8 million and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs of approximately $0.9 million. The venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $51.4 million, of which our share was approximately $18.0 million, and a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million, of which our share was $0.1 million. Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E, Newport Office Park and Long Wharf Marriott were included as part of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest. Minority interests in property partnerships Minority interests in property partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2007 consist of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns our Wisconsin Place Office Property as well as our 505 9th Street project. In connection with partially placing 505 9th Street in service, we consolidated this entity as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. For the year ended December 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership includes our outside equity interest in Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption of the minority interest holder at Citigroup Center on May 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership no longer reflects an allocation to the minority interest holder. Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007 payable on January 30, 2008, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as converted basis in connection with 74 Table of Contents their regular May 2008 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $8.7 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2007. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 and paid on January 30, 2007, we recognized an adjustment of approximately $3.1 million in 2007 to the special cash distribution accrual and allocation of earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units, as a result of conversions of Series Two Preferred Units. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minority interest in our Operating Partnerships income allocation related to an underlying increase in allocable income. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 payable on January 30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2006. Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest On August 7, 2007, we sold Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for approximately $280.5 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $184.5 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of approximately $94.6 million and closing costs of approximately $1.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $168.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $29.9 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. On February 15, 2007, we sold the long term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City and related credits, for approximately $1.28 billion in cash. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $1.23 billion, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $605.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $108.1 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. On June 6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue, a 1,179,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in midtown Manhattan, New York, for approximately $1.2 billion. Net proceeds totaled approximately $875 million after legal defeasance of indebtedness secured by the property (consisting of approximately $254.4 million of principal indebtedness and approximately $28.2 million of related defeasance costs) and the payment of transfer taxes, brokers fees and other customary closing costs. We recognized at closing a gain on sale of approximately $583.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $109.2 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. In January 2006, we recognized a $4.8 million gain (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.9 million) on the sale of a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts which had been accounted for previously as a financing transaction. During January 2006, the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sales of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E, Newport Office Park resulting in a gain of approximately $46.5 million and Long Wharf Marriott during 2007 resulting in a gain of approximately $162.4 million. 75 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund development costs; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); cash flow from operations; distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership; and our Unsecured Line of Credit or other short term bridge facilities. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be partially guaranteed by our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease up thresholds are achieved. Contractual rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our Unsecured Line of Credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs. Material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes. 76 Table of Contents The credit markets continue to be extremely constrained in the real estate sector, as lenders are primarily focusing on refinancing or restructuring existing loans. Lenders are taking relatively little underwriting risk, the amount of capital they are willing to commit has decreased and the underwriting standards that they are employing have become increasingly conservative. We have approximately $251 million of debt maturities in 2009. The largest is approximately $183 million where we have two one year extension options and expect to exercise the first extension option in 2009. The other two loans are with life insurance companies, at conservative loan to value ratios and we expect to refinance or replace them at maturity. In 2010, we have debt maturities totaling approximately $238 million and our unconsolidated joint ventures have debt maturities totaling approximately $670 million (of which our share is approximately $397 million). All of these loans are secured mortgages. The two largest maturities are loans on 125 West 55th Street and Two Grand Central Tower, and we anticipate a reduced loan amount as part of the refinancing of these assets. The remaining loans are moderately leveraged mortgages on stabilized properties where we expect to be able to refinance the existing loan amounts. We intend to be proactive requesting financing bids on these and other stable assets and anticipate completing additional financings during 2009. The remainder of our capital commitments over the next few years are to fund our development program. In total our remaining capital requirements, net of interest and anticipated fundings from existing construction loans, to complete our ongoing developments is $822.9 million, through the end of 2012. With our cash, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit, and the anticipated cash flow generated by the operating portfolio, we believe we have sufficient capacity to fund the entire program. In addition, we expect to arrange supplementary construction facilities on a number of these projects as we move through 2009 to create additional liquidity. For more details on properties under construction, see page 5. Finally, in recent years, we have been an active seller of real estate assets and, although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years. REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend Because capital may continue to be constrained, we are also evaluating the appropriate amount and form of payment of distributions for 2009. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. Our last four regular quarterly distributions (including distributions paid to third party OP unitholders) totaled an aggregate of approximately $385 million. Under the applicable REIT regulations, we can apply the fourth quarter 2008 dividend (which was declared on December 31, 2008 and paid on January 31, 2009), in whole or in part, to satisfy our 2009 minimum REIT distribution requirements. If we choose to apply the entire amount, we could reduce our required 2009 distributions by approximately $97 million. In addition, as a result of a temporary Revenue Procedure recently issued by the Internal Revenue Service, we are, like many other REITs, also evaluating the financial, legal and tax implications (on both stockholders and holders of partnership interests in BPLP) of issuing equity in lieu of a portion of our regular cash dividend. We continue to consider the advantages and disadvantages of reducing our cash distributions and or issuing equity in lieu of a portion of our cash distributions in light of the current state of the capital markets, our current stock price and other factors. Sales To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then current and anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. 77 Table of Contents On December 17, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $5.98 per common share that was paid on January 30, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2007. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2007, including 5 Times Square, Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run Business Park Building E, Worldgate Plaza and Newport Office Park. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Newly Issued Accounting Standards. We expect interest expense to increase for fiscal 2009 due to the estimated impact of FSP No. APB 14 1 and the suspension of construction at 250 West 55th Street. We expect that our decision to suspend development of 250 West 55th Street in New York City will result in a decrease in capitalized interest and a corresponding incremental increase in interest expense of approximately $5 million to $9 million for fiscal 2009. 60 Table of Contents At December 31, 2008, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loans at South of Market, Democracy Tower (formerly South of Market Phase II) and Wisconsin Place Office construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2008 compared with December 31, 2007: December 31, 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,886,424 $ 5,369,243 Variable rate 385,492 122,923 Total $ 6,271,916 $ 5,492,166 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 93.85 % 97.76 % Variable rate 6.15 % 2.24 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.36 % 5.58 % Variable rate 3.62 % 6.11 % Total 5.25 % 5.60 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007. Approximately $10.2 million related to an increase in the Same Property Portfolio and approximately $2.2 million related to acquisition activity. An increase of approximately $8.5 million was attributed to Properties Placed In Service. These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $2.8 million due to the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 5 Times Square in February 2007. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $12.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $41.9 million and $31.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Due to the suspension of construction at 250 West 55th Street late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2009, we expect our 2009 capitalized interest will decrease by approximately $5 million to $9 million and our 2009 capitalized wages will decrease by a modest amount. Net Derivative Losses On September 9, 2008, we executed an interest rate lock agreement with lenders at an all in fixed rate, inclusive of the credit spread, of 6.10% per annum for an eight year, $375.0 million loan collateralized by our Four Embarcadero Center property located in San Francisco, California. Our interest rate hedging program contemplated a financing with a ten year term and, as a result, under SFAS No. 133, during the third quarter of 61 Table of Contents 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $6.6 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of our interest rate contracts. On November 13, 2008, we closed on the Four Embarcadero Center mortgage. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which amounts represent the effective portion of the applicable interest rate hedging contracts. Our interest rate hedging program also contemplated obtaining additional financing of at least $150.0 million by the end of 2008. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, we determined that we would be unable to complete the financing by the required date under our hedging program. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $7.2 million representing the ineffectiveness of our remaining interest rate hedging contracts. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we modified the estimated dates with respect to our anticipated financings under our interest rate hedging program. As a result, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $3.3 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. Losses from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. At December 31, 2008, investment in securities is comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund. The investment was previously included in Cash and Cash Equivalents. In December 2007, the fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors may elect in kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities mature or are liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we expect to retain this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment is subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund are now valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized losses of approximately $1.4 million and $0.3 million on our investment during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also maintain a deferred compensation plan that is designed to allow our officers to defer a portion of their current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals. Our obligation under the plan is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we have balances of approximately $6.6 million and $8.3 million, respectively, into a separate account, which is not restricted as to its use. We recognized income (losses) of approximately $(3.2) million and $0.3 million on the investments in the account associated with our deferred compensation plan during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. In 2007, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August 7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment 62 Table of Contents fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.7 million consisting of the prepayment fee and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures For the year ended December 31, 2008, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $202.4 million compared to December 31, 2007. During December 2008, we recognized non cash impairment charges which represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of the Companys investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. As a result, we recognized non cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55th Street and the Value Added Fund, respectively. If the fair value of our investments deteriorate further, we could recognize additional impairment charges which may be material. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non cash impairment charges in accordance with APB No. 18), which represented our share of land and air rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre development costs. On June 9, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the General Motors Building for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion. On August 12, 2008, we completed the acquisitions of 540 Madison Avenue and Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $705.0 million. On August 13, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 125 West 55th Street located in New York City, New York for an aggregate price of $444.0 million. Each acquisition was completed through a joint venture with US Real Estate Opportunities I, L.P. and Meraas Capital LLC. We have a 60% interest in each venture and provide customary property management and leasing services for each venture. 63 Table of Contents The following table presents actual financial information for the joint ventures for the period ended December 31, 2008 for the General Motors Building and 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower and 125 West 55th Street, respectively.

On June 1, 2007, our Value Added Fund sold Worldgate Plaza located in Herndon, Virginia for approximately $109.0 million. Worldgate Plaza is an office complex consisting of approximately 322,000 net rentable square feet. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $50.5 million, of which our share was approximately $20.3 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of $57.0 million.

Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale estimated to total $23.4 million has been deferred and will be recognized over the project construction period generally, based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2008 of approximately $8.5 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $1.4 million). On August 7, 2007, we sold Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for approximately $280.5 million.

Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. As of August 31, 2008, we no longer provide management services for this building. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 is approximately $67.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we signed new qualifying leases for approximately 17,454 and 22,250 net rentable square feet of the remaining master lease obligation, resulting in the recognition of approximately $20.0 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $3.4 million) and $15.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $2.6 million) of additional gain on sale of real estate, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining master lease obligation totaled approximately $0.9 million. On February 15, 2007, we sold the long term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City and related credits, for approximately $1.28 billion in cash. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $1.23 billion, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $605.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $108.1 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations.

The Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E properties are comprised of three Class A office properties aggregating approximately 337,000 net rentable square feet and an office/technical property totaling approximately 127,000 net rentable square feet, respectively. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $125.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $46.5 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $8.5 million). On April 5, 2007, we sold Newport Office Park, an approximately 172,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Quincy, Massachusetts, for approximately $37.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled 65 Table of Contents approximately $33.7 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $11.5 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $2.1 million.)

The net gain on sale was approximately $162.4 million (net of minority interest of $28.6 million). Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 102 properties, including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2006 and owned through December 31, 2007, totaling approximately 25.5 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2006 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2007. Properties Placed In Service includes our 505 9th Street joint venture project. In connection with partially placing this property in service, we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. The Same Property Portfolio includes our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property, but does not include the Long Wharf Marriott hotel property, which was sold on March 23, 2007. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in service, repositioned or sold. 66 Table of Contents (dollars in thousands) Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold PropertiesAcquired PropertiesPlacedIn Service PropertiesRepositioned Total Property Portfolio 2007 2006 Increase/(Decrease) %Change 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Increase/(Decrease) %Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,196,883 $ 1,142,388 $ 54,495 4.77 % $ 21,902 $ 124,828 $ 48,940 $ 8,244 $ 32,313 $ 24,117 $ 27,199 $ 20,402 $ 1,327,237 $ 1,319,979 $ 7,258 0.55 % Termination Income 6,882 6,999 (117 ) (1.67 )% 1,138 100 6,982 8,137 (1,155 ) (14.19 )% Total Rental Revenue 1,203,765 1,149,387 54,378 4.73 % 21,902 125,966 49,040 8,244 32,313 24,117 27,199 20,402 1,334,219 1,328,116 6,103 0.50 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 419,054 389,872 29,182 7.49 % 6,369 35,439 14,964 2,239 7,995 4,731 7,458 5,424 455,840 437,705 18,135 4.14 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 784,711 759,515 25,196 3.32 % 15,533 90,527 34,076 6,005 24,318 19,386 19,741 14,978 878,379 890,411 (12,032 ) (1.35 )% Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 10,046 8,048 1,998 24.83 % 10,046 8,048 1,998 24.83 % Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 794,757 767,563 27,194 3.54 % 15,533 90,527 34,076 6,005 24,318 19,386 19,741 14,978 888,425 898,459 (10,034 ) (1.12 )% Other Revenue: Development and Management Services 20,553 19,820 733 3.70 % Interest and Other 89,706 36,677 53,029 144.58 % Total Other Revenue 110,259 56,497 53,762 95.16 % Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 69,882 59,375 10,507 17.70 % Interest Expense 285,887 298,260 (12,373 ) (4.15 )% Depreciation and amortization 246,016 238,585 7,431 3.11 % 2,767 18,049 24,155 3,531 8,731 7,365 4,361 3,032 286,030 270,562 15,468 5.72 % Loss from early extinguishments of debt 3,417 32,143 (28,726 ) (89.37 )% Total Other Expenses 246,016 238,585 7,431 3.11 % 2,767 18,049 24,155 3,531 8,731 7,365 4,361 3,032 645,216 660,340 (15,124 ) (2.29 )% Income before minority interests $ 548,741 $ 528,978 $ 19,763 3.74 % $ 12,766 $ 72,478 $ 9,921 $ 2,474 $ 15,587 $ 12,021 $ 15,380 $ 11,946 $ 353,468 $ 294,616 $ 58,852 19.98 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures $ 5,799 $ 7,230 $ (1,431 ) (19.79 )% $ 15,125 $ 17,455 $ (496 ) $ (178 ) $ $ $ $ 20,428 24,507 (4,079 ) (16.64 )% Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ $ $ $ 6,206 $ 16,104 $ $ $ $ $ $ 6,206 16,104 (9,898 ) (61.46 )% Minority interests in property partnerships (84 ) 2,013 (2,097 ) (104.17 )% Minority interest in Operating Partnership (64,916 ) (69,999 ) 5,083 7.26 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 789,238 606,394 182,844 30.15 % Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 220,350 220,350 100.0 % Net Income available to common shareholders $ 1,324,690 $ 873,635 $ 451,055 51.63 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 53.

Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately $39.1 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $7.3 million in straight line rents. Approximately $18.8 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which correlates with the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $3.9 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income.

A decrease of approximately $0.4 million was attributed to reduced work order income. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. In February 2007, our Operating Partnership issued $862.5 million of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes. On February 15, 2007, we completed the sale of our long term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City for approximately $1.23 billion in cash. On March 23, 2007, we completed the sale of the Long Wharf Marriott for approximately $225.6 million in cash. On April 5, 2007, we completed the sale of Newport Office Park for approximately $33.7 million in cash. On August 7, 2007, we completed the sale of Democracy Center for approximately $184.5 million in cash and on November 20, 2007, we completed the sale of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park Building E properties for an aggregate of approximately $125.4 million in cash. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. An overall increase of approximately $2.6 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as well as an increase in long term compensation expense of approximately $3.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized additional expenses related to abandoned project costs of approximately $4.5 million. Commencing in 2003, we began issuing restricted stock and or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four or five year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after 71 Table of Contents November 2006, vesting occurs in equal annual installments over a four year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock based compensation. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $27.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $18.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four year vesting period. Stock based compensation associated with approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five year vesting period. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease is due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, which decreased interest expense by $11.2 million, (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, 191 Spring Street, 101 Carnegie Center, Seven Cambridge Center, Embarcadero Center Three and Embarcadero Center Four, and our 504, 506, 508 and 510 Carnegie Center properties, which decreased interest expense by approximately $15.9 million, and (3) an increase in capitalized interest costs which results in a decrease of interest expense of approximately $18.5 million. These decreases were offset by (1) an increase of approximately $4.4 million related to interest paid on the $450 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership at a per annum interest rate of 3.75%, (2) an increase of approximately $26.2 million related to interest paid on the $862.5 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2007 by our Operating Partnership at an effective per annum interest rate of 3.438% and (3) an increase of approximately $4.3 million related to the acquisition of Kingstowne Towne Center on March 30, 2007 as well as the consolidation of our 505 9th joint venture property due to the involvement we now have because the property is operational. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt. At December 31, 2007, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at South of Market. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006: December 31, 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,369,243 $ 3,889,447 Variable rate 122,923 711,490 Total $ 5,492,166 $ 4,600,937 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 97.76 % 84.54 % Variable rate 2.24 % 15.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.58 % 6.19 % Variable rate 6.11 % 5.80 % Total 5.60 % 6.13 % 72 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $20.6 million related to the 2007 acquisitions compared with the 2006 activity, approximately $0.7 million related to partially placing in service 505 9th Street in the fourth quarter of 2007, approximately $1.3 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter of 2006, and approximately $0.7 million was due to the placing in service of Seven Cambridge Center in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 compared with 280 Park Avenue in 2006, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $15.3 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $11.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $31.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. In conjunction with the sale of Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland on August 7, 2007, we repaid the mortgage financing collateralized by the property totaling approximately $94.6 million. We paid a prepayment fee of approximately $2.6 million associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $2.7 million consisting of the prepayment fee and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. For the year ended December 31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In connection with the legal defeasance of the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries and the principal balance of the mortgage loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our Seven Cambridge Center property. The construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty 73 Table of Contents associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We repaid the construction and permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million comprised of a prepayment penalty and the write off of unamortized deferred finance costs. Income from unconsolidated joint ventures For the year ended December 31, 2007, income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately $4.1 million. On June 1, 2007, our Value Added Fund sold Worldgate Plaza located in Herndon, Virginia for approximately $109.0 million. Worldgate Plaza is an office complex consisting of approximately 322,000 net rentable square feet. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $50.5 million, of which our share was approximately $20.3 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of $57.0 million. Our share of the gain, which is included as income from joint ventures, was approximately $15.5 million which amount reflects the achievement of certain return thresholds as provided for in the joint venture agreement. On October 1, 2007, our 505 9th Street joint venture project, a 323,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in Washington, D.C was partially placed in service. In connection with partially placing this property in service, we consolidated this entity as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. On September 15, 2006, a joint venture in which we had a 35% interest sold 265 Franklin Street located in Boston, Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $170.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $108.3 million, of which our share was approximately $37.9 million, after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of approximately $60.8 million and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs of approximately $0.9 million. The venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $51.4 million, of which our share was approximately $18.0 million, and a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million, of which our share was $0.1 million. Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E, Newport Office Park and Long Wharf Marriott were included as part of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest. Minority interests in property partnerships Minority interests in property partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2007 consist of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns our Wisconsin Place Office Property as well as our 505 9th Street project. In connection with partially placing 505 9th Street in service, we consolidated this entity as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. For the year ended December 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership includes our outside equity interest in Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption of the minority interest holder at Citigroup Center on May 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership no longer reflects an allocation to the minority interest holder. Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007 payable on January 30, 2008, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as converted basis in connection with 74 Table of Contents their regular May 2008 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $8.7 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2007. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 and paid on January 30, 2007, we recognized an adjustment of approximately $3.1 million in 2007 to the special cash distribution accrual and allocation of earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units, as a result of conversions of Series Two Preferred Units. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minority interest in our Operating Partnerships income allocation related to an underlying increase in allocable income. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 payable on January 30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnerships partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2006. Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest On August 7, 2007, we sold Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for approximately $280.5 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $184.5 million, after the repayment of the mortgage indebtedness of approximately $94.6 million and closing costs of approximately $1.4 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $168.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $29.9 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. On February 15, 2007, we sold the long term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City and related credits, for approximately $1.28 billion in cash. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $1.23 billion, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $605.4 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $108.1 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. On June 6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue, a 1,179,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in midtown Manhattan, New York, for approximately $1.2 billion. Net proceeds totaled approximately $875 million after legal defeasance of indebtedness secured by the property (consisting of approximately $254.4 million of principal indebtedness and approximately $28.2 million of related defeasance costs) and the payment of transfer taxes, brokers fees and other customary closing costs. We recognized at closing a gain on sale of approximately $583.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $109.2 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. In January 2006, we recognized a $4.8 million gain (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.9 million) on the sale of a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts which had been accounted for previously as a financing transaction. During January 2006, the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes. Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sales of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park, Building E, Newport Office Park resulting in a gain of approximately $46.5 million and Long Wharf Marriott during 2007 resulting in a gain of approximately $162.4 million. 75 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund development costs; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); cash flow from operations; distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership; and our Unsecured Line of Credit or other short term bridge facilities. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be partially guaranteed by our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease up thresholds are achieved. Contractual rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our Unsecured Line of Credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs. Material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes. 76 Table of Contents The credit markets continue to be extremely constrained in the real estate sector, as lenders are primarily focusing on refinancing or restructuring existing loans. Lenders are taking relatively little underwriting risk, the amount of capital they are willing to commit has decreased and the underwriting standards that they are employing have become increasingly conservative. We have approximately $251 million of debt maturities in 2009. The largest is approximately $183 million where we have two one year extension options and expect to exercise the first extension option in 2009. The other two loans are with life insurance companies, at conservative loan to value ratios and we expect to refinance or replace them at maturity. In 2010, we have debt maturities totaling approximately $238 million and our unconsolidated joint ventures have debt maturities totaling approximately $670 million (of which our share is approximately $397 million). All of these loans are secured mortgages. The two largest maturities are loans on 125 West 55th Street and Two Grand Central Tower, and we anticipate a reduced loan amount as part of the refinancing of these assets. The remaining loans are moderately leveraged mortgages on stabilized properties where we expect to be able to refinance the existing loan amounts. We intend to be proactive requesting financing bids on these and other stable assets and anticipate completing additional financings during 2009. The remainder of our capital commitments over the next few years are to fund our development program. In total our remaining capital requirements, net of interest and anticipated fundings from existing construction loans, to complete our ongoing developments is $822.9 million, through the end of 2012. With our cash, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit, and the anticipated cash flow generated by the operating portfolio, we believe we have sufficient capacity to fund the entire program. In addition, we expect to arrange supplementary construction facilities on a number of these projects as we move through 2009 to create additional liquidity. For more details on properties under construction, see page 5. Finally, in recent years, we have been an active seller of real estate assets and, although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years. REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend Because capital may continue to be constrained, we are also evaluating the appropriate amount and form of payment of distributions for 2009. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. Our last four regular quarterly distributions (including distributions paid to third party OP unitholders) totaled an aggregate of approximately $385 million. Under the applicable REIT regulations, we can apply the fourth quarter 2008 dividend (which was declared on December 31, 2008 and paid on January 31, 2009), in whole or in part, to satisfy our 2009 minimum REIT distribution requirements. If we choose to apply the entire amount, we could reduce our required 2009 distributions by approximately $97 million. In addition, as a result of a temporary Revenue Procedure recently issued by the Internal Revenue Service, we are, like many other REITs, also evaluating the financial, legal and tax implications (on both stockholders and holders of partnership interests in BPLP) of issuing equity in lieu of a portion of our regular cash dividend. We continue to consider the advantages and disadvantages of reducing our cash distributions and or issuing equity in lieu of a portion of our cash distributions in light of the current state of the capital markets, our current stock price and other factors. Sales To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then current and anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. 77 Table of Contents On December 17, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $5.98 per common share that was paid on January 30, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2007. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2007, including 5 Times Square, Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run Business Park Building E, Worldgate Plaza and Newport Office Park. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in
