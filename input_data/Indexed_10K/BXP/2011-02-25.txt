Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on managements beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward looking statements. We caution you that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include, among others, the following: the continuing impact of high unemployment and constrained credit, which is having and may continue to have a negative effect on the following, among other things: the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy, tenant space utilization, and rental rates; the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms, our lenders, counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and institutions that hold our cash balances and short term investments, which may expose us to increased risks of default by these parties; and the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis; general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully; the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); 48 Table of Contents risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and or availability of financing; risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period to period comparisons of financial results; risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks set forth above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8 K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8 K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward looking statements after the date of this report. Overview We are a fully integrated self administered and self managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, DC, San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements and other landlord concessions, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors. From time to time, we also generate cash through the sale of assets. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and enhance revenues as market conditions improve. While the high rate 49 Table of Contents of unemployment continues to negatively impact the fundamentals of our business in many of our markets, we believe that rental rates in all of our markets have stabilized and we are seeing gradual improvement in select submarkets. To be successful in the current leasing environment, we believe all aspects of the tenant landlord relationship must be considered. In this regard, we believe that our understanding of tenants short and long term space needs in the local markets, our relationships with local brokers, our reputation as a premier owner and operator of Class A office properties, our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards provide us with a competitive advantage in an increasingly fragmented office market. Additionally, the premier locations and high caliber of our assets are resulting in increased leasing activity as we are seeing a flight to quality by office tenants. In 2010 we signed leases for more than 6.5 million square feet of space, which exceeds by approximately 2.2 million square feet our annual average over the past five years, and we are seeing improvements in market economics in New York City and other isolated submarkets. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that general office market conditions are dependent on the impact of a recovery in the labor markets, and we are therefore not predicting significant rental rate growth or markedly fewer landlord concessions in the near term. As of December 31, 2010, leases representing approximately 6.9% of the space at our properties expire during 2011. While rental rates in our markets appear to have stabilized, as leases expire, assuming no change in current market rental rates, we expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on any new leases will generally be less than the rates currently being paid, thereby generally resulting in less revenue from the same space. For example, we estimate that the average rent currently paid by our office tenants for leases that expire during 2011 is approximately 3% greater than current market rates for comparable space. Because the individual labor and industry markets may recover at different paces, we may see varying degrees of strength or softness in our core markets. We expect tenants in our markets to continue to take advantage of the ability to upgrade to high quality space like ours, particularly those who value our operational expertise and financial stability when making their leasing decisions. Current market conditions, characterized by overleveraged real estate assets and property owners with insufficient capital resources, have provided opportunities for well capitalized companies and seasoned operators, such as us, to acquire high quality assets. Over the past six months, we acquired three Class A office properties that we had been monitoring and evaluating for some time, which are 510 Madison Avenue in New York City, the John Hancock Tower in Boston and Bay Colony Corporate Center in Waltham, Massachusetts. Each of these properties was for sale because of the aggressive capital structures used to develop or purchase them during the last economic cycle when high leverage debt capital was readily available. We believe these acquisitions present attractive opportunities for long term value creation through the use of our operational, managerial and financial strength. The acquisition of the approximately 1,700,000 square foot iconic John Hancock Tower will strengthen our foothold in Bostons Back Bay office market. In addition, Bay Colony Corporate Center, an approximately 1,000,000 square foot, four building office park that has undergone four ownership changes over the past few years, has experienced deteriorating occupancy and has recently received minimal capital investment. These factors combined with its strong location and historical reputation as one of the premier suburban Boston office addresses present an attractive repositioning and leasing opportunity for a developer and manager such as us. Finally, 510 Madison Avenue, an approximately 347,000 square foot office building that is under development, had been largely ignored by the leasing community due to its uncertain ownership status. Our initial leasing activity has been stronger than expected and we continue to generate positive interest in the building. We believe other acquisition opportunities like those discussed above will continue to present themselves in 2011. However, potential buyers have also become more aggressive about expectations for a recovery as evidenced by the high level of interest we are seeing in marketed assets. The combination of relatively low interest rates and the abundance of capital seeking high quality assets may have a dampening effect on return expectations. While our management team is actively seeking opportunities, we will maintain our disciplined investment strategy, which focuses on high quality assets in supply constrained markets that have historically 50 Table of Contents provided long term value creation. As we seek to deploy capital in 2011, we also expect to actively market some selected assets for sale. We structured the acquisition of the John Hancock Tower as a reverse like kind exchange, which is intended to provide us the flexibility to sell certain assets and retain capital for future investments or the reduction of debt. We are currently evaluating market interest in a sale of all or a significant interest in our Carnegie Center portfolio and may identify other assets for potential sale in 2011. Given the recent low interest rate environment and the opportunity to further enhance our capital position and elongate our debt maturity schedule, we have also been active in the capital markets. Since January 1, 2010, five of our joint ventures have refinanced approximately $714 million in secured financings. In April 2010, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2020 that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $694 million, and in November 2010, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $837 million. We used the proceeds of the November offering to reduce a significant portion of our near term debt maturities. Specifically, we redeemed $700 million of our Operating Partnerships 6.25% senior notes due 2013 and we repurchased $50 million of our Operating Partnerships 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 that the holders may require our Operating Partnership to repurchase in February 2012. Our remaining liquidity, including available cash as of February 18, 2011 of approximately $327 million and full availability under our Operating Partnerships $1.0 billion line of credit, is expected to provide sufficient capacity to fund the completion of our development pipeline and provide capital for future investments. We believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital. We believe the successful lease up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in service through 2012. We are working towards the commencement of two new developments and two redevelopments in the Washington, DC market in 2011. We have also had discussions with potential tenants for our 250 West 55th Street development project in New York City. Although these discussions are in the preliminary stages and we have not yet made a decision to commence construction, we are encouraged that the market in midtown Manhattan has recovered to the point that these discussions are taking place. For descriptions of significant transactions that we entered into during 2010, see Item 1. Business Transactions During 2010. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above and below market leases, leasing and assumed 51 Table of Contents financing origination costs, acquired in place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities, and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings as if vacant. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (2) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such criteria are present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. ASC 360 requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to expense costs that an acquirer incurs to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, 52 Table of Contents property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by guidance in ASC 835 20 Capitalization of Interest and ASC 970 Real Estate General (formerly known as SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects). The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We begin the capitalization of costs during the pre construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed, (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction, or (3) if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest, our representation in the entitys governance, the size of our investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. We may account for cash distributions in excess of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when we are not the general partner in a limited partnership and when we have neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair value below the carrying values have occurred and such decline is other than temporary. The ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value below the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary. To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different 53 Table of Contents than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. We will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partners interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale. The combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases. We recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded approximately $2.4 million of rental revenue representing the adjustments of rents from above and below market leases. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the impact of the straight line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately $85.1 million. These amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from above and below market leases and straight line income from unconsolidated joint ventures, which are disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenants creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; revenue; cash flows; leverage: and liquidity; evaluate the depth and experience of the tenants management team; and assess the strength/growth of the tenants industry. As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenants credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we: require a security deposit; and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenants credit is below our acceptable parameters. We consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenants inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. 54 Table of Contents Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1 through 4. A rating of 1 represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded. A rating of 4 represents the lowest credit rating, in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies and company financial statements are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space utilization (i.e., expansion/downsize/sublease activity); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. If our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in place tenant leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.1 years as of December 31, 2010. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in ASC 605 45 Principal Agent Considerations (ASC 605 45) (formerly known as Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99 19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or (Issue 99 19)). ASC 605 45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. We receive management and development fees from third parties. Property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 360 20 Real Estate Sales (ASC 360 20) (formerly known as SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate). The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in ASC 360 20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives. We allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above and below market leases, origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an 55 Table of Contents assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivatives effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. We account for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings. We account for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 146, 146 and 147 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period to period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio) and the changes attributable to the properties included in Properties Acquired, Sold, Repositioned and Placed in Service. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus income attributable to noncontrolling interests, losses from early extinguishments of debt, (losses) gains from investments in securities, net derivative losses, loss (gain) from suspension of development, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, acquisition costs and general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate, income (loss) 56 Table of Contents from unconsolidated joint ventures, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. NOI excludes certain components from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. in order to provide results that are more closely related to our properties results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. For a reconciliation of NOI to net income attributable to Boston Properties Inc., see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 134 properties, including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2009 and owned through December 31, 2010, totaling approximately 34.8 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2009 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2010. There were no properties that were sold or repositioned after January 1, 2009. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 with respect to the properties which were acquired and placed in service. 57 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio PropertiesAcquiredPortfolio PropertiesPlacedIn ServicePortfolio Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) %Change 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) %Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,420,325 $ 1,423,459 $ (3,134 ) (0.22 )% $ 857 $ $ 46,426 $ 15,058 $ 1,467,608 $ 1,438,517 $ 29,091 2.02 % Termination Income 9,165 14,410 (5,245 ) (36.40 )% 9,165 14,410 (5,245 ) (36.40 )% Total Rental Revenue 1,429,490 1,437,869 (8,379 ) (0.58 )% 857 46,426 15,058 1,476,773 1,452,927 23,846 1.64 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 491,598 497,720 (6,122 ) (1.23 )% 358 9,738 4,079 501,694 501,799 (105 ) (0.02 )% Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 937,892 940,149 (2,257 ) (0.24 )% 499 36,688 10,979 975,079 951,128 23,951 2.52 % Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 7,647 6,419 1,228 19.13 % 7,647 6,419 1,228 19.13 % Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 945,539 946,568 (1,029 ) (0.11 )% 499 36,688 10,979 982,726 957,547 25,179 2.63 % Other Revenue: Development and management services 41,231 34,878 6,353 18.21 % Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 79,658 75,447 4,211 5.58 % Acquisition costs 2,614 2,614 100.00 % Loss (gain) from suspension of development (7,200 ) 27,766 (34,966 ) (125.93 )% Depreciation and amortization 327,221 317,933 9,288 2.92 % 394 10,756 3,748 338,371 321,681 16,690 5.19 % Total Other Expenses 327,221 317,933 9,288 2.92 % 394 10,756 3,748 413,443 424,894 (11,451 ) (2.70 )% Operating Income 618,318 628,635 (10,317 ) (1.64 )% 105 25,932 7,231 610,514 567,531 42,983 7.57 % Other Income: Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 36,774 12,058 24,716 204.98 % Interest and other income 7,332 4,059 3,273 80.64 % Gains from investments in securities 935 2,434 (1,499 ) (61.59 )% Other Expenses: Interest expense 378,079 322,833 55,246 17.11 % Losses from early extinguishments of debt 89,883 510 89,373 17524.12 % Income from continuing operations 187,593 262,739 (75,146 ) (28.60 )% Gains on sales of real estate 2,734 11,760 (9,026 ) (76.75 )% Net income 190,327 274,499 (84,172 ) (30.66 )% Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests: Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships (3,464 ) (2,778 ) (686 ) (24.69 )% Noncontrolling interestredeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership (3,343 ) (3,594 ) 251 6.98 % Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership (24,099 ) (35,534 ) 11,435 32.18 % Noncontrolling interest in gains on sales of real estate common units of the Operating Partnership (349 ) (1,579 ) 1,230 77.90 % Net Income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 159,072 $ 231,014 $ (71,942 ) (31.14 )% (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 56. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $32,800 and $30,385, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $25,153 and $23,966, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 58 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Rental Revenue Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio decreased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Included in Same Property Portfolio rental revenue are decreases in (1) contractual rental revenue of approximately $10.9 million, (2) recoveries from tenants of approximately $23.9 million and (3) parking and other income of approximately $1.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by an approximately $33.6 million increase in straight line rent. The decrease in contractual rental revenue and increase in straight line rents are primarily due to (1) new leases at 399 Park Avenue and 601 Lexington Avenue in New York City and (2) a major law firm lease (approximately 480,000 square feet) in Boston being in free rent periods. The free rent periods for the new leases in New York City ranged from six to twelve months, while the law firms lease in Boston had twelve months of free rent, and these periods expired during 2010 or will expire during 2011. Generally, under each of our leases, we are entitled to recover from the tenant increases in specific operating expenses associated with the leased property above the amount incurred for these operating expenses in the first year of the lease. The decrease in recoveries from tenants is primarily due to the terminations by tenants in New York City and a large lease expiration in Boston. Although the majority of the space was re leased, the new leases are in their first year during which, generally, no tenant recoveries are earned. Termination Income Termination income decreased by approximately $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to twenty three tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $9.2 million, which included (1) approximately $1.6 million from a small retail tenant in New York City, (2) approximately $4.1 million of negotiated termination income from our Reston, Virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and to provide space early to a new tenant, (3) approximately $1.3 million from a tenant at 599 Lexington Avenue in New York City to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and (4) approximately $2.2 million spread across nineteen tenant terminations. Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to sixteen tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $14.4 million, which included (1) approximately $7.5 million of termination income related to a termination agreement with a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue and (2) approximately $3.6 million was non cash income consisting of the estimated value of furniture and fixtures that two tenants transferred to us in connection with the terminations of their leases. Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio decreased approximately $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Included in Same Property Portfolio real estate operating expenses is a decrease in property general and administrative expenses of approximately $3.5 million, of which approximately $1.3 million is related to the write off in 2009 of a leasing commission associated with a tenant that did not take occupancy that did not recur in 2010. In addition, we had overall savings in repairs and maintenance and other property related expenses of approximately $2.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The savings in operating expenses were partially offset by an increase of approximately $1.0 million in insurance expense. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The increase consisted of (1) an approximately 59 Table of Contents $11.7 million increase in the Washington, DC region that was primarily due to accelerated depreciation associated with the future redevelopment of two of our buildings, (2) an increase in depreciation of approximately $3.9 million related to our properties in the Boston region, a portion of which was related to the amortization of tenant improvements costs and (3) an aggregate increase in the other regions of approximately $1.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an approximately $7.4 million decrease due to accelerated depreciation related to a lease termination in New York City that occurred during the second quarter of 2009. Properties Acquired Portfolio On December 29, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the John Hancock Tower and Garage in Boston, Massachusetts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $930.0 million. The John Hancock Tower is a 62 story, approximately 1,700,000 rentable square foot office tower located in the heart of Bostons Back Bay neighborhood. The garage is an eight level, 2,013 space parking facility. Refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the John Hancock Tower and Garage increased our revenue, real estate operating expenses and depreciation by approximately $0.9 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Properties Placed In Service Portfolio At December 31, 2010, we had five properties totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet that were placed in service between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010. Rental Revenue Rental revenue from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $31.4 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (in thousands) One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 $ 5,309 $ 1,516 $ 3,793 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 14,318 7,753 6,565 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 12,224 4,738 7,486 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 4,529 1,051 3,478 Weston Corporate Center Second Quarter, 2010 10,046 10,046 Total $ 46,426 $ 15,058 $ 31,368 60 Table of Contents Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $5.7 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Real Estate Operating Expensesfor the year ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (in thousands) One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 $ 1,519 $ 1,257 $ 262 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 3,453 1,777 1,676 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 2,224 751 1,473 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 1,397 294 1,103 Weston Corporate Center Second Quarter, 2010 1,145 1,145 Total $ 9,738 $ 4,079 $ 5,659 Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased by approximately $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Other Operating Income and Expense Items Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property increased approximately $1.2 million, a 19% increase for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009. We expect our hotel net operating income for fiscal 2011 to be between $8.0 million and $8.5 million. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 PercentageChange Occupancy 77.9 % 75.1 % 3.7 % Average daily rate $ 197.29 $ 185.29 6.5 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 153.65 $ 139.19 10.4 % Development and Management Services Development and management services income increased approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Management fees increased by approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue in New York City. Following the satisfaction of the master lease agreement, the buyer terminated the property management and leasing agreement entered into at the time of the sale, resulting in the recognition of non cash deferred management fees totaling approximately $12.2 million. Development fees decreased by approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to the completion of our 20 F Street third party development project in the first quarter of 2010. We expect third party fee income for fiscal 2011 to be between $20 million and $25 million. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses increased approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to (1) approximately $4.0 million of accelerated 61 Table of Contents expense of the remaining stock based compensation granted between 2006 and 2009 to Edward H. Linde, our late Chief Executive Officer, as a result of his passing on January 10, 2010, (2) an increase of approximately $1.3 million of other payroll related expense and (3) an approximately $0.6 million increase in other non compensatory general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $1.7 million in the value of our deferred compensation plan. We expect general and administrative expense for fiscal 2011 to be between $80 million and $83 million, which includes an approximately $4.3 million charge related to the conclusion of the three year measurement period on February 5, 2011 for the 2008 Outperformance Plan Awards (the 2008 OPP Awards). The 2008 OPP Awards were not earned, and therefore the program was terminated, which resulted in the acceleration of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense during the first quarter of 2011. Refer to Notes 15, 17 and 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 20, 2011, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved outperformance awards under our 1997 Plan to certain officers. These awards (the 2011 OPP Awards) are part of a broad based, long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team with the potential to earn equity awards subject to our outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure. 2011 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (TRS) over a three year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2011 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2014, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $93.38 for the five trading days prior to and including February 1, 2011. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2011 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $40.0 million. We expect that in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation the 2011 OPP Awards will have an aggregate value of approximately $7.8 million, which amount will be amortized into earnings over the five year plan period under the graded vesting method. We expect to expense approximately $2.1 million in fiscal 2011 associated with the amortization related to the 2011 OPP Awards. Refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $11.6 million and $11.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expense discussed above. Acquisition Costs Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to expense costs that an acquirer incurs to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million of acquisition costs associated with our acquisitions of 510 Madison Avenue in New York City and the John Hancock Tower & Garage in Boston, respectively. In addition for the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $0.2 million of acquisition costs associated with our acquisition of Bay Colony Corporate Center in Waltham, Massachusetts. Loss (Gain) from Suspension of Development On February 6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 1,000,000 square foot project at 250 West 55th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a loss of approximately $27.8 million related to the suspension of development, which amount included a $20.0 million contractual amount due pursuant to a lease agreement. On January 19, 2010, we paid $12.8 million related to the termination of such lease. As a result, we recognized approximately $7.2 million of other income during the year ended December 31, 2010. 62 Table of Contents Other Income and Expense Items Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009, income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $24.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009 we incurred non cash impairment losses on the Value Added Fund, which were not present during the year ended December 31, 2010, and therefore our share of the Value Added Funds net income increased by approximately $14.9 million. In June 2009 and December 2009, we recognized non cash impairment charges on our investment in the Value Added Fund of approximately $7.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. These charges represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying value of our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture. In accordance with guidance in ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (formerly known as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18)) a loss of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. If the fair value of our investments deteriorate further, we could recognize additional impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations. In addition, during December 2009, our Value Added Fund recognized a non cash impairment charge in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360 (formerly known as SFAS No. 144) related to our One and Two Circle Star Way properties in San Carlos, California totaling approximately $24.6 million, of which our share was approximately $4.2 million, which amount reflects the reduction in our basis of approximately $2.0 million from previous impairment losses. The Value Added Fund was in discussions with the lender to modify the loan and as a result believed that the carrying value of the properties was not recoverable. Accordingly, the Value Added Fund recognized the non cash impairment charge to reduce the net book value of the properties to their estimated fair market value at December 31, 2009. On October 21, 2010, our Value Added Fund conveyed the fee simple title to its One and Two Circle Star Way properties and paid $3.8 million to the lender in satisfaction of its outstanding obligations under the existing mortgage loan and guarantee. In addition, (1) our share of the General Motors Buildings net income increased by approximately $6.7 million, which was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense related to two major tenant lease expirations, and (2) our share of the 125 West 55th Streets net income increased by approximately $2.9 million, which was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense associated with the refinancing of the propertys mortgage loan. The remaining increase of approximately $0.2 million related to the other unconsolidated joint venture properties. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of increased average cash balances offset by the net effect of lower overall interest rates. The average cash balances for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were approximately $1.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. Gains from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2009, investment in securities was comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund and investments in an account associated with our deferred compensation plan. In December 2007, the unregistered money market fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors could elect in kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund were previously valued at less than their 63 Table of Contents $1.00 par value, we recognized gains of approximately $0.2 million on our investment during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we no longer had investments in this unregistered money market fund. The remainder of the gains from investments in securities for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. Under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officers current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. In order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gains or losses from investments in securities. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 we recognized gains of approximately $0.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased by approximately $0.8 million and $2.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as a result of increases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 as detailed below: Component Change in interestexpense for theyear endedDecember 31, 2010andDecember 31, 2009 (in thousands) Increases to interest expense due to: Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.875% senior notes due 2019 on October 9, 2009 $ 31,786 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.625% senior notes due 2020 on April 19, 2010 27,702 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $850 million in aggregate principal of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 on November 18, 2010 4,345 Decrease in capitalized interest costs 7,835 New mortgage / properties placed in service financings 1,983 Total increases to interest expense $ 73,651 Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgage financings $ (8,562 ) Repurchases by our Operating Partnership of $236.3 million in aggregate principal of 2.875% exchangeable senior notes (5,507 ) Repurchases by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 6.25% senior notes due 2013 (2,190 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other (excluding senior notes) (2,146 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ (18,405 ) Total change in interest expense $ 55,246 The following properties are included in the repayment of mortgage financings line item: Reservoir Place, Eight Cambridge Center, Ten Cambridge Center, 1301 New York Avenue, 202, 206 & 214 Carnegie Center, South of Market, 10 and 20 Burlington Mall Road, 91 Hartwell Avenue and 1330 Connecticut Avenue. The 64 Table of Contents following properties are included in the new mortgages/properties placed in service financings line item: Reservoir Place, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Place Office, 510 Madison Avenue and John Hancock Tower. As properties are placed in service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $41.0 million and $48.8 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. We are evaluating refinancing alternatives on our $457 million mortgage loan on 601 Lexington Avenue and we believe we could raise approximately $700 million to $750 million through a new secured mortgage loan. Assuming such a refinancing, we anticipate our interest expense to be between approximately $410 million to $420 million for fiscal 2011. This amount reflects the impact of approximately $30 million to $35 million of capitalized interest. The actual amount of our net interest expense for fiscal 2011 will be impacted by, among other things, any additional indebtedness we incur, any pre payments or repurchases of existing indebtedness, fluctuations in interest rates and any changes in our development activity. At December 31, 2010, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at Atlantic Wharf, our Unsecured Line of Credit, our secured financing at Reservoir Place and our cash secured financing at 510 Madison Avenue. For a summary of our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 refer to the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources Capitalization Debt Financing within Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On December 12, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed the redemption of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013. The redemption price was determined in accordance with the applicable indenture and was approximately $793.1 million. The redemption price included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 110.75% of the principal amount being redeemed. In addition, on November 29, 2010, we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury issue used in determining the redemption price on notional amounts aggregating $700.0 million. On December 9, 2010, we cash settled the treasury lock agreements and paid approximately $2.1 million. As a result of the payment of the redemption premium, the settlement of the treasury locks and the write off of deferred financing costs, we recognized an aggregate loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $79.3 million. Following the partial redemption, there is an aggregate of $225.0 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Operating Partnership repurchased approximately $236.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, which the holders may require our Operating Partnership to repurchase in February 2012, for approximately $236.6 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate allocated liability and equity value of approximately $225.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. There remains an aggregate of approximately $626.2 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we used available cash to repay approximately $501.2 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.3 million, wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we used available cash to repay approximately $98.4 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling 65 Table of Contents approximately $0.5 million, wrote off approximately $42,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $32,000 related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. Gains on Sales of Real Estate On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale was deferred and has been recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $11.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed construction of the project and recognized the remaining gain on sale totaling approximately $1.8 million. We have recognized a cumulative gain on sale of approximately $23.4 million. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 was approximately $67.3 million. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement, resulting in the recognition of the remaining deferred gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $1.0 million. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. On December 23, 2010, we acquired the outside members 33.3% equity interest in our consolidated joint venture entity that owns the Wisconsin Place Office property located in Chevy Chase, Maryland for cash of approximately $25.5 million. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810. The difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the outside members equity interest, totaling approximately $19.1 million, reduced additional paid in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership decreased by approximately $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in allocable income. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 126 properties, including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2008 and owned through December 31, 2009, totaling approximately 30.1 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2008 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2009. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in service, repositioned or sold. 66 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio PropertiesSoldPortfolio PropertiesAcquiredPortfolio PropertiesPlacedIn ServicePortfolio PropertiesRepositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Increase/(Decrease) %Change 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Increase/(Decrease) %Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,358,000 $ 1,344,408 $ 13,592 1.01 % $ $ 90 $ 7,244 $ 1,828 $ 73,273 $ 43,283 $ $ $ 1,438,517 $ 1,389,609 $ 48,908 3.52 % Termination Income 14,410 12,443 1,967 15.81 % 14,410 12,443 1,967 15.81 % Total Rental Revenue 1,372,410 1,356,851 15,559 1.15 % 90 7,244 1,828 73,273 43,283 1,452,927 1,402,052 50,875 3.63 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 479,983 477,172 2,811 0.59 % 46 1,274 274 20,542 10,538 501,799 488,030 13,769 2.82 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 892,427 879,679 12,748 1.45 % 44 5,970 1,554 52,731 32,745 951,128 914,022 37,106 4.06 % Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 6,419 9,362 (2,943 ) (31.44 )% 6,419 9,362 (2,943 ) (31.44 )% Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 898,846 889,041 9,805 1.10 % 44 5,970 1,554 52,731 32,745 957,547 923,384 34,163 3.70 % Other Revenue: Development and management services 34,878 30,518 4,360 14.29 % Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 75,447 72,365 3,082 4.26 % Loss from suspension of development 27,766 27,766 100.00 % Depreciation and amortization 299,175 293,604 5,571 1.90 % 4,813 1,375 17,693 9,168 321,681 304,147 17,534 5.76 % Total Other Expenses 299,175 293,604 5,571 1.90 % 4,813 1,375 17,693 9,168 424,894 376,512 48,382 12.85 % Operating Income 599,671 595,437 4,234 7.11 % 44 1,157 179 35,038 23,577 567,531 577,390 (9,859 ) (1.71 )% Other Income: Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures 12,058 (182,018 ) 194,076 106.62 % Interest and other 4,059 18,958 (14,899 ) (78.59 )% Gains (losses) from investments in securities 2,434 (4,604 ) 7,038 152.87 % Other Expenses: Interest expense 322,833 295,322 27,511 9.32 % Losses from early extinguishments of debt 510 510 100.00 % Net derivative loss 17,021 (17,021 ) (100.00 )% Income from continuing operations 262,739 97,383 165,356 169.80 % Gains on sales of real estate 11,760 33,340 (21,580 ) (64.73 )% Net income 274,499 130,723 143,776 109.99 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests: Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships (2,778 ) (1,997 ) (781 ) (39.11 )% Noncontrolling interestredeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership (3,594 ) (4,226 ) 632 14.96 % Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership (35,534 ) (14,392 ) (21,142 ) (146.90 )% Noncontrolling interest in gains on sales of real estate common units of the Operating Partnership (1,579 ) (4,838 ) 3,259 67.36 % Net Income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 231,014 $ 105,270 $ 125,744 119.45 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 56. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $30,385 and $36,872, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $23,966 and $27,510, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 67 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Rental Revenue Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately $2.0 million and an increase of approximately $24.3 million in straight line rents. The increase in straight line rent is primarily the result of us establishing in the third quarter of 2008 a $21.0 million reserve, which was reflected as a direct reduction of straight line rent, for the full amount of the accrued straight line rent balances associated with our leases in New York City with Lehman Brothers, Inc. and the law firm of Heller Ehrman LLP. The increases in contractual rental revenue and straight line rent were offset by an approximately $10.4 million decrease in recoveries from tenants in 2009. Generally, under each of our leases, we are entitled to recover from the tenant increases in specific operating expenses associated with the leased property above the amount incurred for these operating expenses in the first year of the lease. The decrease in recoveries from tenants is primarily due to the terminations by tenants in New York City, which resulted in lesser tenant recoveries due to decreased occupancy and, to the extent space was re leased, leases are in their first year during which, generally, no tenant recoveries are earned. We also had an approximately $2.3 million decrease in parking and other income. Termination Income We recognized termination income totaling approximately $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was related to sixteen tenants across the Same Property Portfolio that terminated their leases. Approximately $7.5 million of termination income for 2009 related to a termination agreement with a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue. Approximately $3.6 million is non cash income consisting of the estimated value of furniture and fixtures that two tenants transferred to us in connection with the terminations of their leases. Termination income totaling approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 was related to multiple tenants across the Same Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, including $7.5 million of termination income related to a termination agreement with Heller Ehrman LLP. Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Included in Same Property Portfolio real estate operating expenses is an increase in real estate taxes of approximately $18.0 million, or 9%, which was predominately due to an increase in real estate taxes in the central business districts in Boston and New York City. This was offset by overall decreases in utilities expense of approximately $7.9 million, or 9%, and other property related expenses of approximately $7.3 million of which approximately $3.0 million relates to repairs and maintenance. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was predominately due to accelerated amortization related to tenant terminations in New York City. Properties Sold Portfolio Revenue and real estate operating expenses from the Properties Sold Portfolio decreased by approximately $0.1 million and $46,000, respectively due to the transfer of Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park to the Value Added Fund on January 7, 2008. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for the properties and our continued ownership interest through the Value Added Fund. 68 Table of Contents Properties Acquired Portfolio The acquisition of 635 Massachusetts Avenue on September 26, 2008 increased rental revenue, real estate operating expenses, and depreciation by approximately $5.4 million, $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Properties Placed In Service Portfolio At December 31, 2009, we had seven properties totaling approximately 2.0 million square feet that were placed in service between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009. Rental revenue from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $30.0 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Rental Revenue for theyear ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change (in thousands) 505 9th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 21,974 $ 20,090 $ 1,884 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 27,280 20,010 7,270 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 8,961 2,098 6,863 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 1,516 1,085 431 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 7,753 7,753 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 4,738 4,738 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 1,051 1,051 Total $ 73,273 $ 43,283 $ 29,990 Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $10.0 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Real Estate Operating Expensesfor the year ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change (in thousands) 505 9th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 6,929 $ 5,672 $ 1,257 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 7,057 3,466 3,591 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 2,477 883 1,594 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 1,257 517 740 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 1,777 1,777 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 751 751 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 294 294 Total $ 20,542 $ 10,538 $ 10,004 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased by approximately $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Other Operating Income and Expense Items Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property decreased approximately $2.9 million, a 31.4% decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008. 69 Table of Contents The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: 2009 2008 PercentageChange Occupancy 75.1 % 77.7 % (3.3 )% Average daily rate $ 185.29 $ 217.70 (14.9 )% Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 139.19 $ 169.08 (17.7 )% Development and Management Services Development and management services income increased approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Development fees increased by approximately $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to development fees of approximately $6.1 million for our 20 F Street and 1111 North Capitol Street third party development projects. This increase was offset by a decrease in other development fees of approximately $1.5 million, of which approximately $0.5 million is related to the completion and placing in service of our Annapolis Junction joint venture development project. Management fees decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to the net effect of an approximately $1.0 million increase in management fee income offset by a decrease of approximately $1.2 million in service income of which approximately $1.0 million is attributable to a decrease in work orders and overtime usage of HVAC in New York City. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was the net result of an approximately $8.5 million increase in payroll expense, offset by a decrease in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and a decrease of approximately $2.3 million related to abandoned projects in 2008. Approximately $5.6 million of the payroll expenses increase was related to an increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and approximately $3.1 million was related to the amortization associated with restricted stock equity awards. On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These 2008 OPP Awards were part of a broad based long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilized TRS over a three year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards were eligible to share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards could earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, was subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although only OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million were granted. Under guidance included in ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation (formerly known as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share Based Payment) the 2008 OPP Awards had an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which was generally being amortized into earnings over the five year plan period (although awards for retirement eligible employees will be amortized over a three year period). Because the 2008 OPP Units required us to outperform absolute and relative return thresholds, unless such thresholds were met by the end of the applicable reporting period, we excluded the 2008 OPP Units from the diluted EPS calculation. The 2008 OPP Awards were not earned, and therefore the program was terminated, which resulted in the acceleration of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense during the first quarter of 2011. See Notes 15, 17 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 70 Table of Contents Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $11.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expense discussed above. Loss from Suspension of Development On February 6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 1,000,000 square foot project at 250 West 55th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a loss of approximately $27.8 million related to the suspension of development, which amount included a $20.0 million contractual amount due pursuant to a lease agreement. On January 19, 2010, we paid $12.8 million related to the termination of such lease. As a result, we recognized approximately $7.2 million of other income during the year ended December 31, 2010. Between April 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009, we recognized approximately $1.1 million of additional costs associated with the suspension of development. Other Income and Expense Items Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures During December 2008, we recognized non cash impairment charges which represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with guidance in ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (ASC 323) (formerly known as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18)), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. As a result, we recognized non cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55th Street and the Value Added Fund, respectively. In addition, in June 2009 and December 2009, we recognized additional non cash impairment charges on our investment in the Value Added Fund of approximately $7.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. If the fair value of our investments deteriorates further, we could recognize additional impairment charges which may be material. In addition, during December 2009, our Value Added Fund recognized a non cash impairment charge in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360 (formerly known as SFAS No. 144) related to our One and Two Circle Star Way properties in San Carlos, California totaling approximately $24.6 million, of which our share was approximately $4.2 million, which amount reflects the reduction in our basis of approximately $2.0 million from previous impairment losses. The Value Added Fund was in discussions with the lender to modify the loan and as a result believed that the carrying value of the properties was not recoverable. Accordingly, the Value Added Fund recognized the non cash impairment charge to reduce the net book value of the properties to their estimated fair market value at December 31, 2009. On October 21, 2010, our Value Added Fund conveyed the fee simple title to its One and Two Circle Star Way properties and paid $3.8 million to the lender in satisfaction of its outstanding obligations under the existing mortgage loan and guarantee. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a 71 Table of Contents charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non cash impairment charges in accordance with guidance in ASC 323), which represented our share of land and air rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre development costs. On June 9, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the General Motors Building for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion. On August 12, 2008, we completed the acquisitions of 540 Madison Avenue and Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $705.0 million. On August 13, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 125 West 55th Street located in New York City, New York for an aggregate price of $444.0 million. Each acquisition was completed through a joint venture with US Real Estate Opportunities I, L.P. and Meraas Capital LLC. We have a 60% interest in each venture and provide customary property management and leasing services for each venture. These acquisitions increased our income from unconsolidated joint ventures by approximately $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased approximately $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower overall interest rates. The average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were approximately $602.6 million and $447.1 million, respectively. However, the average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 decreased by approximately 1.70%. Gains (Losses) from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, investment in securities is comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund and investments in an account associated with our deferred compensation plan. In December 2007, the unregistered money market fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors could elect in kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund were valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $0.2 million and ($1.4) million on our investment during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we no longer had investments in this unregistered money market fund. The remainder of the gains (losses) from investments in securities in 2009 and 2008 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. Under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officers current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. In order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gain (loss) from investments in securities. During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, we recognized gains (losses) of $2.2 million and $(3.2) million on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by $2.4 million and $(3.2) million during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a result of increases and decreases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan. 72 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 as detailed below Component Change in interestexpense for theyear endedDecember 31, 2009andDecember 31, 2008 (in thousands) Increases to interest expense due to: New mortgages / properties placed in service $ 22,664 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $747.5 million in aggregate principal of 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due 2014 on August 19, 2008 (excluding the ASC 470 20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14 1) interest expense) 17,736 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.875% senior notes due 2019 on October 9, 2009 9,376 ASC 470 20 interest expense 10,888 Total increases to interest expense $ 60,664 Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgages $ (22,308 ) Increase in capitalized interest costs (2,530 ) Reduction in borrowings under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit (4,852 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other (excluding senior notes and exchangeable senior notes) (3,463 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ (33,153 ) Total change in interest expense $ 27,511 The following properties are included in the repayment of mortgages line item: Reston Corporate Center, Prudential Center, One and Two Embarcadero Center, Bedford Business Park, Reservoir Place, Ten Cambridge Center and 1301 New York Avenue. The following properties are included in the new mortgages/properties placed in service line item: Four Embarcadero Center, South of Market, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Office and Reservoir Place. As properties are placed in service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $48.8 million and $46.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. At December 31, 2009, our variable rate debt consisted of construction loans at our South of Market, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Place Office and Atlantic Wharf construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit and our secured financing at Reservoir Place. 73 Table of Contents The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008: December 31, 2009 2008 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 6,326,350 $ 5,707,392 Variable rate 393,421 385,492 Total $ 6,719,771 $ 6,092,884 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 94.15 % 93.67 % Variable rate 5.85 % 6.33 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.12 % 6.15 % Variable rate 1.98 % 3.62 % Total 5.87 % 5.99 % Coupon/Stated weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.43 % 5.43 % Variable rate 1.75 % 3.07 % Total 5.21 % 5.28 % Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt During the year ended December 31, 2009, we used available cash to repay approximately $98.4 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.5 million, wrote off approximately $42,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $32,000 related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. Net Derivative Losses On September 9, 2008, we executed an interest rate lock agreement with lenders at an all in fixed rate, inclusive of the credit spread, of 6.10% per annum for an eight year, $375.0 million loan collateralized by our Four Embarcadero Center property located in San Francisco, California. Our interest rate hedging program contemplated a financing with a ten year term and, as a result, under guidance included in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, (formerly known as SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities), during the third quarter of 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $6.6 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of our interest rate contracts. On November 13, 2008, we closed on the Four Embarcadero Center mortgage. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which amounts represent the effective portion of the applicable interest rate hedging contracts. Our interest rate hedging program also contemplated obtaining additional financing of at least $150.0 million by the end of 2008. In accordance with guidance included in ASC 815 (formerly known as SFAS No. 133) as amended and interpreted, we determined that we would be unable to complete the financing by the 74 Table of Contents required date under our hedging program. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $7.2 million representing the ineffectiveness of our remaining interest rate hedging contracts. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we modified the estimated dates with respect to our anticipated financings under our interest rate hedging program. As a result, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $3.3 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. Gains on Sales of Real Estate Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the sale of 280 Park Avenue in New York City in 2006, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 is approximately $67.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we signed new qualifying leases for approximately 17,454 net rentable square feet of the remaining master lease obligation, resulting in the recognition of approximately $23.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we signed no new qualifying leases and our remaining master lease obligation totaled approximately $0.9 million. On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale estimated to total $23.4 million was deferred and is being recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 of approximately $11.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership increased by approximately $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in allocable income. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund development costs; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 75 Table of Contents We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); cash flow from operations; distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership; and our Unsecured Line of Credit or other short term bridge facilities. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs. We generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be guaranteed. However, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the projects size and duration and our access to cost effective capital at the given time.

(8) Project costs includes residential and retail components and is subject to a ground lease expiring in 2068. 76 Table of Contents Contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances and draws on our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to enable us to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses. We believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs. Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund dividends and distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes. Given the recent low interest rate environment and the opportunity to further enhance our capital position and elongate our debt maturity schedule, we have also been active in the capital markets. Since January 1, 2010, five of our joint ventures have refinanced approximately $714 million in secured financings. In April 2010, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2020 that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $694 million, and in November 2010, we completed a public offering of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $837 million. We used the proceeds of the November offering to reduce a significant portion of our near term debt maturities. Specifically, we redeemed $700 million of our 6.25% senior notes due 2013 and we repurchased $50 million of our 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 that the holders may require us to repurchase in February 2012. Our remaining liquidity as of February 18, 2011, including available cash of approximately $327 million and full availability under our Operating Partnerships $1.0 billion line of credit, is expected to provide sufficient capacity to fund the completion of our development pipeline and provide capital for future investments. Our most significant capital commitments in 2011 are to fund our development program and repay or refinance expiring debt. We believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital. In 2010, our Operating Partnership exercised its option to extend the maturity date under its $1.0 billion Unsecured Line of Credit to August 3, 2011 and we are currently in discussions on a longer term renewal. We are evaluating refinancing alternatives on our $457 million mortgage loan on 601 Lexington Avenue and we believe we could raise approximately $700 million to $750 million through a new secured mortgage loan. Our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio has three loans maturing in 2011, Mountain View Research Park, Annapolis Junction and Mountain View Technology Park which have balances of approximately $112 million, $43 million and $24 million, respectively (of which our share is $44 million, $22 million and $9 million, respectively). In addition to our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and property specific debt, as of February 18, 2011, our Operating Partnership also had approximately $4.8 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (including approximately $1.8 billion of exchangeable senior notes). All of this debt either matures or is subject to repurchase at the holders option between 2012 and 2021. We are focused on our near and medium term debt maturities and, to date, our Operating Partnership has repurchased approximately $236.3 million of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, which the holders may require us to repurchase in 2012, for approximately $236.6 million, and have redeemed $700 million of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013 for approximately $793.1 million, which included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase unsecured senior notes and unsecured 77 Table of Contents exchangeable senior notes for cash in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or both. We will evaluate any such potential transactions in light of then existing market conditions, taking into account the trading prices of the notes, our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. During the first quarter of 2011 through February 25, 2011, we issued 2,304,994 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $219.0 million. These shares were issued under our $400 million at the market equity offering program. We intend to use the net proceeds from these issuances for general business purposes, which may include investment opportunities and debt reduction. Future potential sales under the program will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, our capital needs and our determinations as to the appropriate sources of funding for our activities. In total, our remaining capital requirements, net of anticipated and potential funding from existing construction loans, to complete our ongoing developments and Weston Corporate Center is approximately $87.8 million, through late 2012. We are working towards the commencement of two new developments and two redevelopments in the Washington, DC market in 2011. With available cash, access to our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and the anticipated cash flow generated by the operating portfolio, we believe we have sufficient capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements and pursue attractive investment opportunities. REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend As a REIT we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. With a view toward increasing our equity over time and preserving additional capital, we reduced our quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2009 to $0.50 per common share. Based on our current expectation for taxable income for 2011, and absent any unanticipated circumstances, we expect that our quarterly dividend will be approximately $0.50 per common share. There can be no assurance that the actual dividends declared by our Board of Directors will not differ materially. Sales We structured the acquisition of the John Hancock Tower as a reverse like kind exchange, which is intended to provide us the flexibility to sell certain assets within 180 days of the closing, defer any taxable gain and thereby retain capital for future investments or the reduction of debt. We are currently evaluating market interest in a sale of all or a significant interest in our Carnegie Center portfolio and may identify other assets for potential sale in 2011. To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On December 12, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed the redemption of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013. The redemption price was determined in accordance with the applicable indenture and was approximately $793.1 million. The redemption price included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 110.75% of the principal amount being redeemed. In addition, on November 29, 2010, we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury issue used in determining the redemption price on notional amounts aggregating $700.0 million. On December 9, 2010, we cash settled the treasury lock agreements and paid approximately $2.1 million. As a result of the payment of the redemption premium, the settlement of the treasury locks and the write off of deferred financing costs, we recognized an aggregate loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $79.3 million. Following the partial redemption, there is an aggregate of $225.0 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Operating Partnership repurchased approximately $236.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, which the holders may require our Operating Partnership to repurchase in February 2012, for approximately $236.6 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate allocated liability and equity value of approximately $225.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. There remains an aggregate of approximately $626.2 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we used available cash to repay approximately $501.2 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.3 million, wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we used available cash to repay approximately $98.4 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling 65 Table of Contents approximately $0.5 million, wrote off approximately $42,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $32,000 related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. Gains on Sales of Real Estate On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale was deferred and has been recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $11.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed construction of the project and recognized the remaining gain on sale totaling approximately $1.8 million. We have recognized a cumulative gain on sale of approximately $23.4 million. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 was approximately $67.3 million. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement, resulting in the recognition of the remaining deferred gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $1.0 million. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. On December 23, 2010, we acquired the outside members 33.3% equity interest in our consolidated joint venture entity that owns the Wisconsin Place Office property located in Chevy Chase, Maryland for cash of approximately $25.5 million. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810. The difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the outside members equity interest, totaling approximately $19.1 million, reduced additional paid in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership decreased by approximately $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in allocable income. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 126 properties, including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2008 and owned through December 31, 2009, totaling approximately 30.1 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2008 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2009. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in service, repositioned or sold. 66 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio PropertiesSoldPortfolio PropertiesAcquiredPortfolio PropertiesPlacedIn ServicePortfolio PropertiesRepositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Increase/(Decrease) %Change 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 2009 2008 Increase/(Decrease) %Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,358,000 $ 1,344,408 $ 13,592 1.01 % $ $ 90 $ 7,244 $ 1,828 $ 73,273 $ 43,283 $ $ $ 1,438,517 $ 1,389,609 $ 48,908 3.52 % Termination Income 14,410 12,443 1,967 15.81 % 14,410 12,443 1,967 15.81 % Total Rental Revenue 1,372,410 1,356,851 15,559 1.15 % 90 7,244 1,828 73,273 43,283 1,452,927 1,402,052 50,875 3.63 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 479,983 477,172 2,811 0.59 % 46 1,274 274 20,542 10,538 501,799 488,030 13,769 2.82 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 892,427 879,679 12,748 1.45 % 44 5,970 1,554 52,731 32,745 951,128 914,022 37,106 4.06 % Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 6,419 9,362 (2,943 ) (31.44 )% 6,419 9,362 (2,943 ) (31.44 )% Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 898,846 889,041 9,805 1.10 % 44 5,970 1,554 52,731 32,745 957,547 923,384 34,163 3.70 % Other Revenue: Development and management services 34,878 30,518 4,360 14.29 % Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 75,447 72,365 3,082 4.26 % Loss from suspension of development 27,766 27,766 100.00 % Depreciation and amortization 299,175 293,604 5,571 1.90 % 4,813 1,375 17,693 9,168 321,681 304,147 17,534 5.76 % Total Other Expenses 299,175 293,604 5,571 1.90 % 4,813 1,375 17,693 9,168 424,894 376,512 48,382 12.85 % Operating Income 599,671 595,437 4,234 7.11 % 44 1,157 179 35,038 23,577 567,531 577,390 (9,859 ) (1.71 )% Other Income: Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures 12,058 (182,018 ) 194,076 106.62 % Interest and other 4,059 18,958 (14,899 ) (78.59 )% Gains (losses) from investments in securities 2,434 (4,604 ) 7,038 152.87 % Other Expenses: Interest expense 322,833 295,322 27,511 9.32 % Losses from early extinguishments of debt 510 510 100.00 % Net derivative loss 17,021 (17,021 ) (100.00 )% Income from continuing operations 262,739 97,383 165,356 169.80 % Gains on sales of real estate 11,760 33,340 (21,580 ) (64.73 )% Net income 274,499 130,723 143,776 109.99 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests: Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships (2,778 ) (1,997 ) (781 ) (39.11 )% Noncontrolling interestredeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership (3,594 ) (4,226 ) 632 14.96 % Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership (35,534 ) (14,392 ) (21,142 ) (146.90 )% Noncontrolling interest in gains on sales of real estate common units of the Operating Partnership (1,579 ) (4,838 ) 3,259 67.36 % Net Income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 231,014 $ 105,270 $ 125,744 119.45 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 56. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $30,385 and $36,872, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $23,966 and $27,510, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 67 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Rental Revenue Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately $2.0 million and an increase of approximately $24.3 million in straight line rents. The increase in straight line rent is primarily the result of us establishing in the third quarter of 2008 a $21.0 million reserve, which was reflected as a direct reduction of straight line rent, for the full amount of the accrued straight line rent balances associated with our leases in New York City with Lehman Brothers, Inc. and the law firm of Heller Ehrman LLP. The increases in contractual rental revenue and straight line rent were offset by an approximately $10.4 million decrease in recoveries from tenants in 2009. Generally, under each of our leases, we are entitled to recover from the tenant increases in specific operating expenses associated with the leased property above the amount incurred for these operating expenses in the first year of the lease. The decrease in recoveries from tenants is primarily due to the terminations by tenants in New York City, which resulted in lesser tenant recoveries due to decreased occupancy and, to the extent space was re leased, leases are in their first year during which, generally, no tenant recoveries are earned. We also had an approximately $2.3 million decrease in parking and other income. Termination Income We recognized termination income totaling approximately $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which was related to sixteen tenants across the Same Property Portfolio that terminated their leases. Approximately $7.5 million of termination income for 2009 related to a termination agreement with a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue. Approximately $3.6 million is non cash income consisting of the estimated value of furniture and fixtures that two tenants transferred to us in connection with the terminations of their leases. Termination income totaling approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 was related to multiple tenants across the Same Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, including $7.5 million of termination income related to a termination agreement with Heller Ehrman LLP. Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Included in Same Property Portfolio real estate operating expenses is an increase in real estate taxes of approximately $18.0 million, or 9%, which was predominately due to an increase in real estate taxes in the central business districts in Boston and New York City. This was offset by overall decreases in utilities expense of approximately $7.9 million, or 9%, and other property related expenses of approximately $7.3 million of which approximately $3.0 million relates to repairs and maintenance. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was predominately due to accelerated amortization related to tenant terminations in New York City. Properties Sold Portfolio Revenue and real estate operating expenses from the Properties Sold Portfolio decreased by approximately $0.1 million and $46,000, respectively due to the transfer of Mountain View Research Park and Mountain View Technology Park to the Value Added Fund on January 7, 2008. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for the properties and our continued ownership interest through the Value Added Fund. 68 Table of Contents Properties Acquired Portfolio The acquisition of 635 Massachusetts Avenue on September 26, 2008 increased rental revenue, real estate operating expenses, and depreciation by approximately $5.4 million, $1.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Properties Placed In Service Portfolio At December 31, 2009, we had seven properties totaling approximately 2.0 million square feet that were placed in service between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2009. Rental revenue from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $30.0 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Rental Revenue for theyear ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change (in thousands) 505 9th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 21,974 $ 20,090 $ 1,884 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 27,280 20,010 7,270 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 8,961 2,098 6,863 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 1,516 1,085 431 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 7,753 7,753 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 4,738 4,738 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 1,051 1,051 Total $ 73,273 $ 43,283 $ 29,990 Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $10.0 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Real Estate Operating Expensesfor the year ended December 31, 2009 2008 Change (in thousands) 505 9th Street First Quarter, 2008 $ 6,929 $ 5,672 $ 1,257 South of Market Fourth Quarter, 2008 7,057 3,466 3,591 77 CityPoint Fourth Quarter, 2008 2,477 883 1,594 One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 1,257 517 740 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 1,777 1,777 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 751 751 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 294 294 Total $ 20,542 $ 10,538 $ 10,004 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased by approximately $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Other Operating Income and Expense Items Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property decreased approximately $2.9 million, a 31.4% decrease for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008. 69 Table of Contents The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008: 2009 2008 PercentageChange Occupancy 75.1 % 77.7 % (3.3 )% Average daily rate $ 185.29 $ 217.70 (14.9 )% Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 139.19 $ 169.08 (17.7 )% Development and Management Services Development and management services income increased approximately $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Development fees increased by approximately $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to development fees of approximately $6.1 million for our 20 F Street and 1111 North Capitol Street third party development projects. This increase was offset by a decrease in other development fees of approximately $1.5 million, of which approximately $0.5 million is related to the completion and placing in service of our Annapolis Junction joint venture development project. Management fees decreased by approximately $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 due to the net effect of an approximately $1.0 million increase in management fee income offset by a decrease of approximately $1.2 million in service income of which approximately $1.0 million is attributable to a decrease in work orders and overtime usage of HVAC in New York City. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was the net result of an approximately $8.5 million increase in payroll expense, offset by a decrease in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.8 million and $1.3 million, respectively, and a decrease of approximately $2.3 million related to abandoned projects in 2008. Approximately $5.6 million of the payroll expenses increase was related to an increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan and approximately $3.1 million was related to the amortization associated with restricted stock equity awards. On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These 2008 OPP Awards were part of a broad based long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilized TRS over a three year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards were eligible to share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards could earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, was subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although only OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million were granted. Under guidance included in ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation (formerly known as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share Based Payment) the 2008 OPP Awards had an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which was generally being amortized into earnings over the five year plan period (although awards for retirement eligible employees will be amortized over a three year period). Because the 2008 OPP Units required us to outperform absolute and relative return thresholds, unless such thresholds were met by the end of the applicable reporting period, we excluded the 2008 OPP Units from the diluted EPS calculation. The 2008 OPP Awards were not earned, and therefore the program was terminated, which resulted in the acceleration of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense during the first quarter of 2011. See Notes 15, 17 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 70 Table of Contents Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $11.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expense discussed above. Loss from Suspension of Development On February 6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 1,000,000 square foot project at 250 West 55th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a loss of approximately $27.8 million related to the suspension of development, which amount included a $20.0 million contractual amount due pursuant to a lease agreement. On January 19, 2010, we paid $12.8 million related to the termination of such lease. As a result, we recognized approximately $7.2 million of other income during the year ended December 31, 2010. Between April 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009, we recognized approximately $1.1 million of additional costs associated with the suspension of development. Other Income and Expense Items Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures During December 2008, we recognized non cash impairment charges which represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In accordance with guidance in ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (ASC 323) (formerly known as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18)), a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. As a result, we recognized non cash impairment charges of approximately $31.9 million, $74.3 million, $45.1 million and $13.8 million on our investments in 540 Madison Avenue, Two Grand Central Tower, 125 West 55th Street and the Value Added Fund, respectively. In addition, in June 2009 and December 2009, we recognized additional non cash impairment charges on our investment in the Value Added Fund of approximately $7.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. If the fair value of our investments deteriorates further, we could recognize additional impairment charges which may be material. In addition, during December 2009, our Value Added Fund recognized a non cash impairment charge in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360 (formerly known as SFAS No. 144) related to our One and Two Circle Star Way properties in San Carlos, California totaling approximately $24.6 million, of which our share was approximately $4.2 million, which amount reflects the reduction in our basis of approximately $2.0 million from previous impairment losses. The Value Added Fund was in discussions with the lender to modify the loan and as a result believed that the carrying value of the properties was not recoverable. Accordingly, the Value Added Fund recognized the non cash impairment charge to reduce the net book value of the properties to their estimated fair market value at December 31, 2009. On October 21, 2010, our Value Added Fund conveyed the fee simple title to its One and Two Circle Star Way properties and paid $3.8 million to the lender in satisfaction of its outstanding obligations under the existing mortgage loan and guarantee. During December 2008, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% interest suspended development activity on its Eighth Avenue and 46th Street project located in New York City. The proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air rights, including contracts to acquire land parcels and air rights, on which the joint venture was to construct a Class A office property. As a result, we recognized a 71 Table of Contents charge totaling approximately $23.2 million (including $2.9 million of non cash impairment charges in accordance with guidance in ASC 323), which represented our share of land and air rights impairment losses, forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre development costs. On June 9, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the General Motors Building for a purchase price of approximately $2.8 billion. On August 12, 2008, we completed the acquisitions of 540 Madison Avenue and Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $705.0 million. On August 13, 2008, we completed the acquisition of 125 West 55th Street located in New York City, New York for an aggregate price of $444.0 million. Each acquisition was completed through a joint venture with US Real Estate Opportunities I, L.P. and Meraas Capital LLC. We have a 60% interest in each venture and provide customary property management and leasing services for each venture. These acquisitions increased our income from unconsolidated joint ventures by approximately $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased approximately $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of lower overall interest rates. The average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were approximately $602.6 million and $447.1 million, respectively. However, the average interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 decreased by approximately 1.70%. Gains (Losses) from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, investment in securities is comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund and investments in an account associated with our deferred compensation plan. In December 2007, the unregistered money market fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors could elect in kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund were valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $0.2 million and ($1.4) million on our investment during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, we no longer had investments in this unregistered money market fund. The remainder of the gains (losses) from investments in securities in 2009 and 2008 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. Under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officers current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. In order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gain (loss) from investments in securities. During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, we recognized gains (losses) of $2.2 million and $(3.2) million on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by $2.4 million and $(3.2) million during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as a result of increases and decreases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan. 72 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 as detailed below Component Change in interestexpense for theyear endedDecember 31, 2009andDecember 31, 2008 (in thousands) Increases to interest expense due to: New mortgages / properties placed in service $ 22,664 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $747.5 million in aggregate principal of 3.625% exchangeable senior notes due 2014 on August 19, 2008 (excluding the ASC 470 20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14 1) interest expense) 17,736 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.875% senior notes due 2019 on October 9, 2009 9,376 ASC 470 20 interest expense 10,888 Total increases to interest expense $ 60,664 Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgages $ (22,308 ) Increase in capitalized interest costs (2,530 ) Reduction in borrowings under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit (4,852 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other (excluding senior notes and exchangeable senior notes) (3,463 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ (33,153 ) Total change in interest expense $ 27,511 The following properties are included in the repayment of mortgages line item: Reston Corporate Center, Prudential Center, One and Two Embarcadero Center, Bedford Business Park, Reservoir Place, Ten Cambridge Center and 1301 New York Avenue. The following properties are included in the new mortgages/properties placed in service line item: Four Embarcadero Center, South of Market, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Office and Reservoir Place. As properties are placed in service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $48.8 million and $46.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. At December 31, 2009, our variable rate debt consisted of construction loans at our South of Market, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Place Office and Atlantic Wharf construction projects, as well as our borrowings under our Unsecured Line of Credit and our secured financing at Reservoir Place. 73 Table of Contents The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2009 compared with December 31, 2008: December 31, 2009 2008 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 6,326,350 $ 5,707,392 Variable rate 393,421 385,492 Total $ 6,719,771 $ 6,092,884 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 94.15 % 93.67 % Variable rate 5.85 % 6.33 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.12 % 6.15 % Variable rate 1.98 % 3.62 % Total 5.87 % 5.99 % Coupon/Stated weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.43 % 5.43 % Variable rate 1.75 % 3.07 % Total 5.21 % 5.28 % Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt During the year ended December 31, 2009, we used available cash to repay approximately $98.4 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.5 million, wrote off approximately $42,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $32,000 related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. Net Derivative Losses On September 9, 2008, we executed an interest rate lock agreement with lenders at an all in fixed rate, inclusive of the credit spread, of 6.10% per annum for an eight year, $375.0 million loan collateralized by our Four Embarcadero Center property located in San Francisco, California. Our interest rate hedging program contemplated a financing with a ten year term and, as a result, under guidance included in ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, (formerly known as SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities), during the third quarter of 2008 we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $6.6 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of our interest rate contracts. On November 13, 2008, we closed on the Four Embarcadero Center mortgage. Under our interest rate hedging program, we will reclassify into earnings over the eight year term of the loan as an increase in interest expense approximately $26.4 million (approximately $3.3 million per year) of the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, which amounts represent the effective portion of the applicable interest rate hedging contracts. Our interest rate hedging program also contemplated obtaining additional financing of at least $150.0 million by the end of 2008. In accordance with guidance included in ASC 815 (formerly known as SFAS No. 133) as amended and interpreted, we determined that we would be unable to complete the financing by the 74 Table of Contents required date under our hedging program. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $7.2 million representing the ineffectiveness of our remaining interest rate hedging contracts. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we modified the estimated dates with respect to our anticipated financings under our interest rate hedging program. As a result, we recognized a net derivative loss of approximately $3.3 million representing the partial ineffectiveness of the interest rate contracts. Gains on Sales of Real Estate Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the sale of 280 Park Avenue in New York City in 2006, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 is approximately $67.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we signed new qualifying leases for approximately 17,454 net rentable square feet of the remaining master lease obligation, resulting in the recognition of approximately $23.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we signed no new qualifying leases and our remaining master lease obligation totaled approximately $0.9 million. On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale estimated to total $23.4 million was deferred and is being recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 of approximately $11.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership increased by approximately $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in allocable income. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund development costs; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 75 Table of Contents We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); cash flow from operations; distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership; and our Unsecured Line of Credit or other short term bridge facilities. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs. We generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be guaranteed. However, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the projects size and duration and our access to cost effective capital at the given time.

(3) On October 1, 2010, we modified the construction facility by releasing from collateral the residential component and ground floor retail included in the Russia Building and reducing the loan commitment from $215.0 million to $192.5 million. We have not drawn any amounts under this facility but we reserve the right to do so in the future. (4) Project includes 17,000 square feet of retail space. (5) Project includes 20,000 square feet of retail space and is subject to a ground lease which expires in 2068. (6) Acquired September 24, 2010; base building is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2011. Estimated future equity requirements include approximately $13 million of capitalized interest. (7) Project costs includes residential and retail components. Estimated total investment is net of $12.0 million of anticipated net proceeds from the sale of Federal historic tax credits. (8) Project costs includes residential and retail components and is subject to a ground lease expiring in 2068. 76 Table of Contents Contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances and draws on our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to enable us to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses. We believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs. Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund dividends and distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes. Given the recent low interest rate environment and the opportunity to further enhance our capital position and elongate our debt maturity schedule, we have also been active in the capital markets. Since January 1, 2010, five of our joint ventures have refinanced approximately $714 million in secured financings. In April 2010, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2020 that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $694 million, and in November 2010, we completed a public offering of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 that raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $837 million. We used the proceeds of the November offering to reduce a significant portion of our near term debt maturities. Specifically, we redeemed $700 million of our 6.25% senior notes due 2013 and we repurchased $50 million of our 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 that the holders may require us to repurchase in February 2012. Our remaining liquidity as of February 18, 2011, including available cash of approximately $327 million and full availability under our Operating Partnerships $1.0 billion line of credit, is expected to provide sufficient capacity to fund the completion of our development pipeline and provide capital for future investments. Our most significant capital commitments in 2011 are to fund our development program and repay or refinance expiring debt. We believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital. In 2010, our Operating Partnership exercised its option to extend the maturity date under its $1.0 billion Unsecured Line of Credit to August 3, 2011 and we are currently in discussions on a longer term renewal. We are evaluating refinancing alternatives on our $457 million mortgage loan on 601 Lexington Avenue and we believe we could raise approximately $700 million to $750 million through a new secured mortgage loan. Our unconsolidated joint venture portfolio has three loans maturing in 2011, Mountain View Research Park, Annapolis Junction and Mountain View Technology Park which have balances of approximately $112 million, $43 million and $24 million, respectively (of which our share is $44 million, $22 million and $9 million, respectively). In addition to our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and property specific debt, as of February 18, 2011, our Operating Partnership also had approximately $4.8 billion of unsecured senior notes outstanding (including approximately $1.8 billion of exchangeable senior notes). All of this debt either matures or is subject to repurchase at the holders option between 2012 and 2021. We are focused on our near and medium term debt maturities and, to date, our Operating Partnership has repurchased approximately $236.3 million of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, which the holders may require us to repurchase in 2012, for approximately $236.6 million, and have redeemed $700 million of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013 for approximately $793.1 million, which included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase unsecured senior notes and unsecured 77 Table of Contents exchangeable senior notes for cash in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or both. We will evaluate any such potential transactions in light of then existing market conditions, taking into account the trading prices of the notes, our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital. During the first quarter of 2011 through February 25, 2011, we issued 2,304,994 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $219.0 million. These shares were issued under our $400 million at the market equity offering program. We intend to use the net proceeds from these issuances for general business purposes, which may include investment opportunities and debt reduction. Future potential sales under the program will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, our capital needs and our determinations as to the appropriate sources of funding for our activities. In total, our remaining capital requirements, net of anticipated and potential funding from existing construction loans, to complete our ongoing developments and Weston Corporate Center is approximately $87.8 million, through late 2012. We are working towards the commencement of two new developments and two redevelopments in the Washington, DC market in 2011. With available cash, access to our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and the anticipated cash flow generated by the operating portfolio, we believe we have sufficient capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements and pursue attractive investment opportunities. REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend As a REIT we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. With a view toward increasing our equity over time and preserving additional capital, we reduced our quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2009 to $0.50 per common share. Based on our current expectation for taxable income for 2011, and absent any unanticipated circumstances, we expect that our quarterly dividend will be approximately $0.50 per common share. There can be no assurance that the actual dividends declared by our Board of Directors will not differ materially. Sales We structured the acquisition of the John Hancock Tower as a reverse like kind exchange, which is intended to provide us the flexibility to sell certain assets within 180 days of the closing, defer any taxable gain and thereby retain capital for future investments or the reduction of debt. We are currently evaluating market interest in a sale of all or a significant interest in our Carnegie Center portfolio and may identify other assets for potential sale in 2011. To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales.
