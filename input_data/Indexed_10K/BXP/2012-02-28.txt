Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on managements beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward looking statements. We caution you that, while forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements include, among others, the following: the continuing impact of high unemployment and other macroeconomic trends, which is having and may continue to have a negative effect on the following, among other things: the fundamentals of our business, including overall market occupancy, tenant space utilization and rental rates; the financial condition of our tenants, many of which are financial, legal and other professional firms, our lenders, counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and institutions that hold our cash balances and short term investments, which may expose us to increased risks of default by these parties; and the value of our real estate assets, which may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or obtain or maintain debt financing secured by our properties or on an unsecured basis; general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully; the ability of our joint venture partners to satisfy their obligations; risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the impact of higher interest rates on the cost and or availability of financing; 48 Table of Contents risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period to period comparisons of financial results; risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks set forth above are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8 K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8 K or otherwise, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update any forward looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, future events, or otherwise, and you should not rely upon these forward looking statements after the date of this report. Overview We are a fully integrated self administered and self managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets Boston, New York, Princeton, San Francisco and Washington, DC. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements and other landlord concessions, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space and general economic factors. From time to time, we also generate cash through the sale of assets. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure in down cycles and enhance revenues as market conditions improve. To be successful in the current leasing environment, we believe all aspects of the tenant landlord relationship must be considered. In this regard, we believe that our understanding of tenants short and long term space needs in the local markets, our relationships with local brokers, our reputation as a premier owner and operator of Class A office properties, our financial strength and our ability to maintain high building standards provide us with a competitive advantage 49 Table of Contents in an increasingly fragmented office market. We expect tenants in our markets to continue to take advantage of the ability to upgrade to high quality space like ours, particularly those who value our operational expertise and financial stability when making their leasing decisions. Leasing trends continue to improve in Cambridge, Massachusetts and the Central Business District and suburban submarkets of San Francisco, which suggests that there are sectors of the economy that are growing despite the uncertain and challenging macroeconomic issues. These submarkets are experiencing stronger leasing velocity, additional space demand, increasing rental rates and or lower transaction concessions. In the midtown Manhattan market activity is stable, although velocity slowed during the second half of 2011. Given our current occupancy in that market of approximately 98%, our leasing in the near term will be generated from smaller spaces where there is good activity. In Washington, DC, the leasing activity in the public sector market has been adversely impacted by the federal budgetary uncertainty and the reductions in discretionary spending programs, and the activity in the private sector market has also been moderate. Overall, during 2011, leases for approximately 5,581,000 square feet of space commenced revenue recognition, including leases for approximately 4,301,000 square feet of second generation space and leases for approximately 1,280,000 square feet of first generation space, stemming mostly from completion of development projects. These second generation leases had an average lease term of approximately 80 months and included an average of approximately 97 days of free rent and total transaction costs, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, of approximately $30.05 per square foot. Transaction costs were relatively low compared to recent historical standards due to a high percentage of leases signed at suburban properties where tenant concessions and brokerage commissions tend to be lower than Central Business District costs. The starting gross rents for the approximately 3,358,000 square feet of second generation leases that had been occupied within the prior 12 months decreased on average by approximately 1.07% compared to the ending gross rents from the previous leases for this space. Lease terms are highly dependent on location (i.e., whether the property is in a Central Business District or suburban location), whether the lease is a renewal or with a new tenant, and the length of the lease term. As of December 31, 2011, leases representing approximately 6.1% of the space at our properties expire through December 31, 2012. While rental rates in our markets have stabilized and have begun to increase in select submarkets, as leases expire in 2012, assuming no further change in current market rental rates, we expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on new leases will generally be slightly greater than the rates currently being paid, thereby generally resulting in more revenue from the same space. We believe the successful lease up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in service through 2015. In 2011, we partially or fully placed in service Atlantic Wharf, The Lofts at Atlantic Wharf, 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, the Residences on The Avenue and 510 Madison Avenue. In addition, during 2011, we commenced or resumed the development and redevelopment of approximately $1.8 billion of projects, including approximately $1.05 billion on our planned 989,000 square foot office tower at 250 West 55th Street in midtown Manhattan that is currently 19% pre leased. We also continue to actively explore acquisition opportunities. During 2011, we acquired two assets, one in Waltham, Massachusetts and one in Mountain View, California, for a total investment of approximately $256 million. We believe acquisition opportunities will continue to present themselves; however, the combination of relatively low interest rates and the abundance of capital seeking high quality assets may have a dampening effect on return expectations. While we are primarily focused on opportunities in our existing markets, we are open to investments in new markets both in the United States and possibly outside the United States. We are primarily interested in investing in markets that share common traits with our existing core markets, namely 24 hour world class cities with highly educated work forces, high barriers to entry and a diverse and strong international tenant base, and in which we would expect to establish an operating platform over time. While our management team is actively seeking opportunities, they intend to carefully evaluate the risks inherent in 50 Table of Contents investing in any new markets and maintain our disciplined investment strategy, which focuses on high quality assets in supply constrained markets that have historically provided long term value creation. In addition, we believe that our strong cash balance, availability under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and access to both secured and unsecured debt at attractive rates provide us with ample capital to pursue acquisition opportunities. These same market conditions that make it challenging to acquire assets at attractive yields also provide us with the opportunity to sell assets. On October 25, 2011, we sold our Two Grand Central Tower joint venture asset (of which our share was 60%), located in New York City, for $401.0 million and may consider the sale of other assets in our portfolio. For descriptions of significant transactions that we completed during 2011, see Item 1. Business Transactions During 2011. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above and below market leases, leasing and assumed financing origination costs, acquired in place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities, and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings as if vacant. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and (2) managements estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenants lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during 51 Table of Contents hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such criteria are present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. ASC 360 requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the propertys net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets and the asset is written down to the lower of carrying value or fair market value. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to expense costs that an acquirer incurs to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins, and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by guidance in ASC 835 20 Capitalization of Interest and ASC 970 Real Estate General (formerly known as SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects). The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre construction costs necessary to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We begin the capitalization of costs during the pre construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed, (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction, or (3) if activities necessary for the development of the property have been suspended. 52 Table of Contents Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures We consolidate variable interest entities in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is defined by the entity having both of the following characteristics: (1) the power to direct the activities that, when taken together, most significantly impact the variable interest entitys performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the variable interest entity that would be significant to the variable interest entity. Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because it exercises significant influence over, but does not control, these entities. Our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of the our ownership interest, our representation in the entitys governance, the size of our investment (including loans), estimates of future cash flows, our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture, if applicable. Our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint ventures distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. We may account for cash distributions in excess of our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture as income when we are not the general partner in a limited partnership and when we have neither the requirement nor the intent to provide financial support to the joint venture. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair value below the carrying values have occurred and such decline is other than temporary. The ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value below the carrying value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary. To the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture, our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture. To the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level, the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture. We will recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures, relating solely to the outside partners interest, to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale. The combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases. We recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded approximately $10.8 million of rental revenue representing the adjustments of rents from above and below market leases. For the year ended 53 Table of Contents December 31, 2011, the impact of the straight line rent adjustment increased rental revenue by approximately $77.0 million. These amounts exclude the adjustment of rents from above and below market leases and straight line income from unconsolidated joint ventures, which are disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenants creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; revenue; cash flows; leverage: and liquidity; evaluate the depth and experience of the tenants management team; and assess the strength/growth of the tenants industry. As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenants credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we: require a security deposit; and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenants credit is below our acceptable parameters. We consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenants inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1 through 4. A rating of 1 represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded. A rating of 4 represents the lowest credit rating, in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies and company financial statements are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space utilization (i.e., expansion/downsize/sublease activity); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. 54 Table of Contents If our estimates of collectability differ from the cash received, then the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in place tenant leases, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 6.8 years as of December 31, 2011. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with guidance in ASC 605 45 Principal Agent Considerations (ASC 605 45) (formerly known as Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 99 19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or (Issue 99 19)). ASC 605 45 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. We receive management and development fees from third parties. Property management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions included in ASC 360 20 Real Estate Sales (ASC 360 20) (formerly known as SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate). The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in ASC 360 20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives. We allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above and below market leases, origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. 55 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges. These judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivatives effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income and equity. We account for the effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative in other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassify the effective portion to earnings over the term that the hedged transaction affects earnings. We account for the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative directly in earnings. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 153, 146 and 146 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period to period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio) and the changes attributable to the properties included in the Acquired, Placed in Service, Sold or Development or Redevelopment Portfolios. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service, acquired or in development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus income attributable to noncontrolling interests, losses from early extinguishments of debt, losses (gains) from investments in securities, suspension of development, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, acquisition costs and general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. NOI excludes certain components from net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. in order to provide results that are more closely related to our properties results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life 56 Table of Contents estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. For a reconciliation of NOI to net income attributable to Boston Properties Inc., see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2010 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 128 properties totaling approximately 30.4 million net rentable square feet of space, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures and structured parking. The Same Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2010 and owned and in service through December 31, 2011. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service, acquired or in development or redevelopment after January 1, 2010 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2011. There were no consolidated properties that were sold after January 1, 2010. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 with respect to the properties which were placed in service, acquired or in development or redevelopment. 57 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio PropertiesAcquiredPortfolio PropertiesPlacedIn ServicePortfolio Properties inDevelopmentorRedevelopmentPortfolio Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Increase/(Decrease) %Change 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 Increase/(Decrease) %Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,454,380 $ 1,445,676 $ 8,704 0.60 % $ 128,885 $ 857 $ 85,893 $ 10,046 $ 5,540 $ 11,029 $ 1,674,698 $ 1,467,608 $ 207,090 14.11 % Termination Income 14,293 9,165 5,128 55.95 % (20 ) 2,591 16,864 9,165 7,699 84.00 % Total Rental Revenue 1,468,673 1,454,841 13,832 0.95 % 128,865 857 85,893 10,046 8,131 11,029 1,691,562 1,476,773 214,789 14.54 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 500,813 495,828 4,985 1.01 % 57,857 358 33,358 1,145 1,949 4,363 593,977 501,694 92,283 18.39 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 967,860 959,013 8,847 0.92 % 71,008 499 52,535 8,901 6,182 6,666 1,097,585 975,079 122,506 12.56 % Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 8,401 7,647 754 9.86 % 8,401 7,647 754 9.86 % Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 976,261 966,660 9,601 0.99 % 71,008 499 52,535 8,901 6,182 6,666 1,105,986 982,726 123,260 12.54 % Other Revenue: Development and management services 33,435 41,231 (7,796 ) (18.91 )% Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 81,442 79,658 1,784 2.24 % Acquisition costs 155 2,614 (2,459 ) (94.07 )% Suspension of development (7,200 ) 7,200 100.00 % Depreciation and amortization 334,943 326,196 8,747 2.68 % 62,182 394 22,900 2,038 19,159 9,743 439,184 338,371 100,813 29.79 % Total Other Expenses 334,943 326,196 8,747 2.68 % 62,182 394 22,900 2,038 19,159 9,743 520,781 413,443 107,338 25.96 % Operating Income 641,318 640,464 854 0.13 % 8,826 105 29,635 6,863 (12,977 ) (3,077 ) 618,640 610,514 8,126 1.33 % Other Income: Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 85,896 36,774 49,122 133.58 % Interest and other 5,358 7,332 (1,974 ) (26.92 )% Gains (losses) from investments in securities (443 ) 935 (1,378 ) (147.38 )% Other Expenses: Interest expense 394,131 378,079 16,052 4.25 % Losses from early extinguishments of debt 1,494 89,883 (88,389 ) (98.34 )% Income from continuing operations 313,826 187,593 126,233 67.29 % Gains on sales of real estate 2,734 (2,734 ) (100.00 )% Net income 313,826 190,327 123,499 64.89 % Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests: Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships (1,558 ) (3,464 ) 1,906 55.02 % Noncontrolling interestredeemable preferred units of the Operating Partnership (3,339 ) (3,343 ) 4 0.12 % Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership (36,250 ) (24,099 ) (12,151 ) (50.42 %) Noncontrolling interest in gains on sales of real estate common units of the Operating Partnership (349 ) 349 100.00 % Net Income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. $ 272,679 $ 159,072 $ 113,607 71.42 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 56. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $34,529 and $32,800, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $26,128 and $25,153, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 58 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Rental Revenue Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily the result of an increase of approximately $1.4 million in rental revenue from our leases, coupled with increases in parking and other revenue and other recoveries of approximately $3.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The increase in rental revenue from our leases of approximately $1.4 million is the result of our average revenue increasing by approximately $0.42 per square foot, contributing approximately $11.7 million, offset by an approximately $10.3 million decrease due to a decline in occupancy from 92.3% to 91.6%. We expect rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio to decline for 2012 as a result of the expiration of leases at Embarcadero Center Four in San Francisco and Gateway Center in South San Francisco, the expiration of an approximately 207,000 square foot lease at 111 Huntington Avenue in Boston in October 2011 and the expiration of an approximately 145,000 square foot lease at 399 Park Avenue in New York City in mid 2012. Although we have re leased a portion of the Embarcadero Center Four and 399 Park Avenue space and we have re leased the entire 111 Huntington Avenue space, there will be an interruption in revenue in 2012. In addition, we have a large tenant vacating approximately 700,000 square feet of space, in Reston, Virginia, of which we will be redeveloping approximately 523,000 square feet for the Defense Intelligence Agency at 12300 and 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive. We have begun the redevelopment of the first phase of the two building redevelopment and removed the first building from service, and therefore also removed it from the Same Property Portfolio, in July 2011. The second building, 12300 Sunrise Valley Drive, will be similarly removed from service in the first quarter of 2012. The third building, 12290 Sunrise Valley Drive, is currently leased until the second quarter 2012 and we do not expect to receive any income from this building following expiration of the lease through the end of 2012. With an approximately 307,000 square foot lease commencing at 111 Huntington Avenue in January 2012 and the leasing activity we are currently experiencing in San Francisco and Boston, we expect our occupancy to then begin improving during 2012. However, the impact on the Same Property Portfolio net operating income from the foregoing vacancies and transactions is expected to result in a decrease of approximately 1.5% to 3% from 2011 to 2012. Termination Income Termination income increased by approximately $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2011 related to sixteen tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $14.3 million, which included approximately $1.8 million of termination income related to a default by a 30,000 square foot law firm tenant in one of our New York City properties and approximately $10.5 million related to us entering into lease amendments we signed on July 1, 2011 with the existing tenant at our three building complex in Reston, Virginia, which will be redeveloped as the headquarters for the Defense Intelligence Agency. Under the agreements, the existing tenant will terminate early its leases for approximately 523,000 square feet at the complex and be responsible for certain payments to us aggregating approximately $14.8 million. One of the buildings has already been taken out of service and therefore the operating results of that property, including any termination income received, is shown under the Properties in Development or Redevelopment Portfolio. We anticipate recognizing the remaining approximately $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2012. Once 12300 Sunrise Valley Drive is placed in redevelopment, it will no longer be considered part of the Same Property Portfolio and any operating results will be shown under the Properties in Development or Redevelopment Portfolio. Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to twenty three tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $9.2 million, which included (1) approximately $1.6 million from a small retail tenant in New York City, (2) approximately $4.1 million of negotiated termination income from our Reston, Virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and to provide space early to a new tenant, (3) approximately $1.3 million from a tenant at 599 Lexington Avenue in New York City to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and (4) approximately $2.2 million spread across nineteen tenant terminations. 59 Table of Contents Real Estate Operating Expenses Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $5.0 million, or 1% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 due to a net increase in general property operating expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily the result of the acceleration of depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2011 totaling approximately $13.7 million in anticipation of the planned redevelopment of our 12300 Sunrise Valley Drive property located in Reston, Virginia, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation of approximately $3.7 million at a building outside San Francisco, CA that had a significant lease expiration and therefore no longer has depreciation and amortization related to that tenant and a decrease in depreciation of approximately $1.8 million resulting from the acceleration of depreciation expense in 2010 related to our decision in 2010 to reclassify three in service properties to land held for future development that did not recur in 2011. These three properties totaled approximately 131,000 square feet, are currently planned for redevelopment and are no longer held available for lease. Properties Acquired Portfolio On December 29, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the John Hancock Tower and Garage in Boston, Massachusetts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $930.0 million. The John Hancock Tower is a 62 story, approximately 1,700,000 rentable square foot office tower located in the heart of Bostons Back Bay neighborhood. The garage is an eight level, 2,013 space parking facility. On February 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Bay Colony Corporate Center in Waltham, Massachusetts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $185.0 million. Bay Colony Corporate Center is an approximately 985,000 net rentable square foot, four building Class A office park situated on a 58 acre site in Waltham, Massachusetts. On November 22, 2011, we acquired 2440 West El Camino Real located in Mountain View, California for a purchase price of approximately $71.1 million. 2440 West El Camino Real is an approximately 140,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property. Rental Revenue Rental revenue from our Properties Acquired Portfolio increased approximately $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (in thousands) John Hancock Tower and Garage December 29, 2010 $ 109,002 $ 857 $ 108,145 Bay Colony Corporate Center February 1, 2011 19,067 19,067 2440 West El Camino Real November 22, 2011 816 816 Total $ 128,885 $ 857 $ 128,028 60 Table of Contents Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from our Properties Acquired Portfolio increased approximately $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, as detailed below: Property Date Acquired Real Estate Operating Expensesfor the year ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (in thousands) John Hancock Tower and Garage December 29, 2010 $ 45,544 $ 358 $ 45,186 Bay Colony Corporate Center February 1, 2011 12,008 12,008 2440 West El Camino Real November 22, 2011 305 305 Total $ 57,857 $ 358 $ 57,499 Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for our Properties Acquired Portfolio increased by approximately $61.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the depreciation expense associated with our properties that were acquired after December 31, 2010, as well as the additional depreciation expense incurred for the year ended December 31, 2011 associated with John Hancock Tower and Garage that was acquired on December 29, 2010 and, as a result, was not recognizing depreciation expense for the full year ended December 31, 2010. Properties Placed In Service Portfolio We had six properties totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet that were placed in service or partially place in service between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011. Rental Revenue Rental revenue from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $76.0 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (in thousands) Weston Corporate Center Second Quarter, 2010 $ 17,575 $ 10,046 $ 7,529 510 Madison Avenue Second Quarter, 2011 7,270 7,270 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue Third Quarter, 2011 17,656 17,656 Residences on The Avenue Residential Third Quarter, 2011 5,632 5,632 The Lofts at Atlantic Wharf Residential Third Quarter, 2011 985 985 Atlantic Wharf Office Fourth Quarter, 2011 36,775 36,775 Total $ 85,893 $ 10,046 $ 75,847 61 Table of Contents Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $32.2 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Real Estate Operating Expensesfor the year ended December 31, 2011 2010 Change (in thousands) Weston Corporate Center Second Quarter, 2010 $ 2,754 $ 1,145 1,609 510 Madison Avenue Second Quarter, 2011 2,995 2,995 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue Third Quarter, 2011 11,326 11,326 Residences on The Avenue Residential Third Quarter, 2011 4,958 4,958 The Lofts at Atlantic Wharf Residential Third Quarter, 2011 521 521 Atlantic Wharf Office Fourth Quarter, 2011 10,804 10,804 Total $ 33,358 $ 1,145 $ 32,213 Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased by approximately $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 as a result of the depreciation expense associated with our properties that were placed in service or partially placed in service after December 31, 2010 as well as the additional depreciation expense incurred for the year ended December 31, 2011 associated with Weston Corporate Center that was placed in service in the second quarter of 2010 and, as a result, was not recognizing depreciation expense for the full year ended December 31, 2010. Properties in Development or Redevelopment Portfolio At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Properties in Development or Redevelopment Portfolio consisted primarily of our 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive property located in Reston, Virginia and our 250 West 55th Street development project located in New York City. On February 6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 989,000 square foot office project at 250 West 55th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized approximately $0.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of additional costs associated with the suspension and ongoing maintenance of the development project. On May 24, 2011, we signed a lease with the law firm of Morrison & Foerster LLP for approximately 184,000 square feet at 250 West 55th Street and construction of the project has resumed. As a result of our decision to resume development, in May 2011 we began interest capitalization and are no longer expensing costs associated with this project. On July 1, 2011, we entered into lease amendments with the existing tenant at our three building complex in Reston, Virginia, which will be redeveloped as the headquarters for the Defense Intelligence Agency. Under the agreements, the tenant will terminate early its leases for approximately 523,000 square feet at the complex and be responsible for certain payments to us aggregating approximately $14.8 million, of which we recognized approximately $2.6 million related to our 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive property, which is the building that has been taken out of service. Although this building has been taken out of service, the remainder of the termination income that we will receive from the building that is still in service will be reflected under the Same Store Portfolio. On July 5, 2011, we commenced the redevelopment of the 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive property at the complex, which is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, this building had revenue, excluding termination income, of approximately $5.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively, and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 of approximately $1.0 62 Table of Contents million and $2.0 million, respectively. In addition, the increase in depreciation is the result of the acceleration of depreciation expense during the year ended December 31, 2011 totaling approximately $9.4 million in anticipation of the redevelopment of this building. Other Operating Income and Expense Items Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property increased approximately $0.8 million, a 10% increase for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. We expect our hotel net operating income for fiscal 2012 to be between $8.5 million and $9.5 million. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 PercentageChange Occupancy 78.2 % 77.9 % 0.4 % Average daily rate $ 210.45 $ 197.29 6.7 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 164.15 $ 153.65 6.8 % Development and Management Services Development and management services income decreased approximately $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in management fee income of approximately $12.1 million partially offset by an approximately $4.3 million increase in development income. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue in New York City. Following the satisfaction of the master lease agreement, the buyer terminated the property management and leasing agreement entered into at the time of the sale, resulting in the recognition of non cash deferred management fees totaling approximately $12.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in development fees is due to an increase in development fees related to 75 Ames Street in Cambridge, MA and George Washington University Science and Engineering Hall in Washington, DC, offset by a decrease in development fees as a result of our completion of the 20 F Street third party development project. We expect fee income for fiscal 2012 to be between $25 million and $30 million. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses increased approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 which was primarily due to expensing approximately $1.6 million of transaction pursuit costs coupled with an increase in other general and administrative expenses and professional fees of approximately $1.7 million and $0.7 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense of approximately $2.2 million. The decrease in compensation expense is primarily due to the accelerated expense during the first quarter of 2010 of the remaining stock based compensation granted between 2006 and 2009 to Edward H. Linde, our late Chief Executive Officer, as a result of his passing on January 10, 2010 totaling approximately $5.8 million and an approximately $1.0 million decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan, offset by the acceleration of the remaining unrecognized compensation expense totaling approximately $4.3 million associated with the termination of the 2008 OPP Awards during the first quarter of 2011. We expect general and administrative expense for fiscal 2012 to be between $85 million and $87 million, which includes an approximately $4.5 million charge related to the resignation of Mr. Norville. On February 13, 2012, E. Mitchell Norville announced that he will resign as our Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer effective on February 29, 2012. See Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 25, 2012, our Compensation Committee approved outperformance awards under our 1997 Stock Option and Incentive Plan to our officers and employees. These awards (the 2012 OPP Awards) are part of a broad based, long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team with the 63 Table of Contents potential to earn equity awards subject to us outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure. Recipients of 2012 OPP Awards will share in a maximum outperformance pool of $40.0 million if the total return to shareholders, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from February 7, 2012 to February 6, 2015. Earned awards are generally subject to two years of time based vesting after the performance measurement date. We expect that under ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation the 2012 OPP Awards will have an aggregate value of approximately $7.7 million, which amount will be amortized into earnings over the five year plan period under the graded vesting method and has been reflected in the 2012 guidance. See Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were approximately $11.0 million and $11.6 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expense discussed above. Acquisition Costs Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to expense costs that an acquirer incurs to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred approximately $0.2 million of acquisition costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million of acquisition costs associated with our acquisitions of 510 Madison Avenue in New York City and the John Hancock Tower and Garage in Boston, respectively. In addition for the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $0.2 million of acquisition costs associated with our acquisition of Bay Colony Corporate Center in Waltham, Massachusetts. Suspension of Development On February 6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 1,000,000 square foot project at 250 West 55th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a loss of approximately $27.8 million related to the suspension of development, which amount included a $20.0 million contractual amount due pursuant to a lease agreement. On January 19, 2010, we paid $12.8 million related to the termination of such lease. As a result, we recognized approximately $7.2 million of other income during the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Income and Expense Items Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures For the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $49.1 million. This increase was primarily due to the following (1) our share of Two Grand Central Towers net income increased by approximately $40.2 million, which was primarily due to the sale of the property, (2) our share of the General Motors Buildings net income increased by approximately $6.0 million, which was primarily due to a decrease in deprecation expense related to tenant expirations and (3) our share of the Value Added Funds net income increased by approximately $0.9 million due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of the conveyance of fee simple title to its One and Two Circle Star Way properties on October 21, 2010. On October 25, 2011, an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 60% interest completed the sale of Two Grand Central Tower located in New York City for approximately $401.0 million, including the assumption by the buyer of approximately $176.6 million of mortgage indebtedness. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $210.0 million, of which our share was approximately $126.0 million, after the payment of 64 Table of Contents transaction costs of approximately $14.4 million. Two Grand Central Tower is an approximately 650,000 net rentable square foot Class A office tower. The unconsolidated joint ventures carrying value of the net assets of the property aggregated approximately $427.1 million. As a result, pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360 Property, Plant and Equipment (ASC 360) (formerly known as SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets), the unconsolidated joint venture recognized a non cash impairment loss and loss on sale of real estate aggregating approximately $40.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, which is equal to the difference between (1) the sale price less cost to sell and (2) the carrying value of the net assets of the property. Separately, in 2008 we had recognized an impairment loss on our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture totaling approximately $74.3 million under the provisions of ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (ASC 323) (formerly known as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18)). As a result, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $46.2 million, which is included within income from unconsolidated joint ventures on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For 2012, we expect the cash contributions from our operating and placed in service unconsolidated joint ventures to increase, but we will realize a decrease of approximately $16 million (our share) of above and below market lease income under ASC 805 Business Combinations due to the expiration of certain leases, which will adversely impact our income from unconsolidated joint ventures. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income decreased approximately $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. Interest income decreased approximately $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 as the result of a decrease in the average cash balance and lower overall interest rates. The average cash balances for the year ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 were approximately $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. On June 6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue in New York City. In connection with the sale, in lieu of a closing adjustment in favor of the buyer for certain unfunded tenant improvements, we retained the obligation to pay for the improvements, subject to the tenant initiating the request for reimbursement. The total amount of unfunded tenant improvements at closing was approximately $1.0 million and has yet to be requested by the tenants. During the year ended December 31, 2011, a tenants lease expired for which we had unfunded tenant improvement liabilities of approximately $0.8 million, resulting in the recognition of other income in that amount. Gains (Losses) from Investments in Securities Gains (losses) from investments in securities for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. Under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officers current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. In order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gains or losses from investments in securities. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 we recognized gains (losses) of approximately $(0.4) million and $0.9 million, respectively, on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately $(0.3) million and $0.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan. 65 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 as detailed below: Component Change in interestexpense for theyear endedDecember 31, 2011andDecember 31, 2010 (in thousands) Increases to interest expense due to: Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.625% senior notes due 2020 on April 19, 2010 $ 11,697 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $850 million in aggregate principal of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 on November 18, 2010 31,210 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $850 million in aggregate principal of 3.700% senior notes due 2018 on November 10, 2011 4,491 New mortgage / properties placed in service financings 54,199 Interest on our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit 1,844 Interest associated with the increased interest rate related to Montvale Center being in default 1,055 Total increases to interest expense $ 104,496 Decreases to interest expense due to: Repurchases by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 6.25% senior notes due 2013 $ (41,797 ) Repurchases by our Operating Partnership of $286.3 million in aggregate principal of 2.875% exchangeable senior notes (2,734 ) Repayment of mortgage financings (33,998 ) Increase in capitalized interest costs (7,197 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other (excluding senior notes) (2,718 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ (88,444 ) Total change in interest expense $ 16,052 The following properties are included in the repayment of mortgage financings line item: Eight Cambridge Center, 202, 206 & 214 Carnegie Center, South of Market, Democracy Tower, 10 and 20 Burlington Mall Road, 91 Hartwell Avenue, 1330 Connecticut Avenue, Wisconsin Place Office, 601 Lexington Avenue and Reservoir Place. The following properties are included in the new mortgages/properties placed in service financings line item: John Hancock Tower, Bay Colony Corporate Center, 510 Madison Avenue, Atlantic Wharf and 601 Lexington Avenue. As properties are placed in service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. Included within the interest on our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit line item is the interest expense associated with our borrowing that had been secured by 601 Lexington Avenue. For information on the Montvale Center mortgage loan see Notes 6 and 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $48.2 million and $41.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. We anticipate net interest expense for 2012 will be between $390 million to $395 million. This estimate reflects the impact of (1) $40 million to $45 million of capitalized interest, (2) our Operating Partnerships 66 Table of Contents offering in November 2011 of $850.0 million of 3.700% senior notes due 2018, (3) the redemption/repurchase in February 2012 of our Operating Partnerships 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 (See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and (4) the expected repayment of approximately $209 million of secured financings during the first quarter of 2012, and assumes that we will not incur any additional indebtedness, make any pre payments or repurchases of existing indebtedness, and that there will not be any fluctuations in interest rates or any changes in our development activity. The actual amount of our interest expense for fiscal 2012 will be impacted by, among other things, any additional indebtedness we incur, any pre payments or repurchases of existing indebtedness, fluctuations in interest rates and any changes in our development activity. At December 31, 2011, our variable rate debt consisted of our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit. For a summary of our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 refer to the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources Capitalization Debt Financing within Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On November 9, 2011, our Operating Partnership repurchased $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 for approximately $50.2 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate carrying value of approximately $49.6 million at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.6 million. On November 9, 2011, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our Reservoir Place property located in Waltham, Massachusetts totaling $50.0 million. The mortgage financing bore interest at a variable rate equal to Eurodollar plus 2.20% per annum and was scheduled to mature on July 30, 2014. There was no prepayment penalty. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. On November 16, 2011, we terminated the construction loan facility collateralized by our Atlantic Wharf property totaling $192.5 million. The construction loan facility bore interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum and was scheduled to mature on April 21, 2012 with two, one year extension options, subject to certain conditions. We did not draw any amounts under the facility. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.4 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. On December 12, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed the redemption of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013. The redemption price was determined in accordance with the applicable indenture and was approximately $793.1 million. The redemption price included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 110.75% of the principal amount being redeemed. In addition, on November 29, 2010, we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury issue used in determining the redemption price on notional amounts aggregating $700.0 million. On December 9, 2010, we cash settled the treasury lock agreements and paid approximately $2.1 million. As a result of the payment of the redemption premium, the settlement of the treasury locks and the write off of deferred financing costs, we recognized an aggregate loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $79.3 million. Following the partial redemption, there is an aggregate of $225.0 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Operating Partnership repurchased approximately $236.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 for approximately $236.6 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate allocated liability and equity value of approximately $225.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we used available cash to repay approximately $501.2 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling 67 Table of Contents approximately $0.3 million, wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. For a discussion of the redemption/repurchase in February 2012 of the approximately $576.2 million aggregate principal amount of our Operating Partnerships 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, please see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains on Sales of Real Estate On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale was deferred and has been recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed construction of the project and recognized the remaining gain on sale totaling approximately $1.8 million. We have recognized a cumulative gain on sale of approximately $23.4 million. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 was approximately $67.3 million. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement, resulting in the recognition of the remaining deferred gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $1.0 million. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships decreased by approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consisted of the outside owners equity interest in the income from our 505 9th Street property. For the year ended December 31, 2010, noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. On December 23, 2010, we acquired the outside members 33.3% equity interest in our consolidated joint venture entity that owns the Wisconsin Place Office property located in Chevy Chase, Maryland for cash of approximately $25.5 million. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810. The difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the outside members equity interest, totaling approximately $19.1 million, reduced additional paid in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership increased by approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 due to an increase in allocable income partially offset by a decrease in the noncontrolling interests ownership percentage. 68 Table of Contents Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 126 properties totaling approximately 29.9 million net rentable square feet of space, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures and structured parking.

Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $32,800 and $30,385, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $25,153 and $23,966, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 70 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Rental Revenue Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio decreased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $2.1 million in rental revenue from our leases and a decrease in parking and other income of $1.9 million, coupled with an increase in other recoveries of approximately $0.9 million. The decrease in rental revenue from our leases of approximately $2.1 million was the result of our average revenue increasing by approximately $0.11 per square foot, contributing approximately $3.1 million, offset by an approximately $5.2 million decrease due to a decline in occupancy from 93.0% to 92.4%. Generally, under each of our leases, we are entitled to recover from the tenant increases in specific operating expenses associated with the leased property above the amount incurred for these operating expenses in the first year of the lease. The decrease in recoveries from tenants is primarily due to the terminations by tenants in New York City and a large lease expiration in Boston. Although the majority of the space was re leased, the new leases are in their first year during which, generally, no tenant recoveries are earned. Termination Income Termination income decreased by approximately $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to twenty three tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $9.2 million, which included (1) approximately $1.6 million from a small retail tenant in New York City, (2) approximately $4.1 million of negotiated termination income from our Reston, Virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and to provide space early to a new tenant, (3) approximately $1.3 million from a tenant at 599 Lexington Avenue in New York City to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and (4) approximately $2.2 million spread across nineteen tenant terminations. Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to sixteen tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $14.4 million, which included (1) approximately $7.5 million of termination income related to a termination agreement with a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue and (2) approximately $3.6 million was non cash income consisting of the estimated value of furniture and fixtures that two tenants transferred to us in connection with the terminations of their leases. Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio decreased approximately $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Included in Same Property Portfolio real estate operating expenses is a decrease in property general and administrative expenses of approximately $3.5 million, of which approximately $1.3 million is related to the write off in 2009 of a leasing commission associated with a tenant that did not take occupancy that did not recur in 2010. In addition, we had overall savings in repairs and maintenance and other property related expenses of approximately $2.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The savings in operating expenses were partially offset by an increase of approximately $1.0 million in insurance expense. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The increase consisted of (1) an approximately $11.7 million increase in the Washington, DC region that was primarily due to accelerated depreciation 71 Table of Contents associated with the future redevelopment of two of our buildings, (2) an increase in depreciation of approximately $3.9 million related to our properties in the Boston region, a portion of which was related to the amortization of tenant improvements costs and (3) an aggregate increase in the other regions of approximately $1.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an approximately $7.4 million decrease due to accelerated depreciation related to a lease termination in New York City that occurred during the second quarter of 2009. Properties Acquired Portfolio On December 29, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the John Hancock Tower and Garage in Boston, Massachusetts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $930.0 million. The John Hancock Tower is a 62 story, approximately 1,700,000 rentable square foot office tower located in the heart of Bostons Back Bay neighborhood. The garage is an eight level, 2,013 space parking facility. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the John Hancock Tower and Garage increased our revenue, real estate operating expenses and depreciation by approximately $0.9 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Properties Placed In Service Portfolio We had five properties totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet that were placed in service between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010. Rental Revenue Rental revenue from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $31.4 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Rental Revenue for theyear ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (in thousands) One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 $ 5,309 $ 1,516 $ 3,793 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 14,318 7,753 6,565 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 12,224 4,738 7,486 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 4,529 1,051 3,478 Weston Corporate Center Second Quarter, 2010 10,046 10,046 Total $ 46,426 $ 15,058 $ 31,368 Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $5.7 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Real Estate Operating Expensesfor the year ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (in thousands) One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 $ 1,519 $ 1,257 $ 262 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 3,453 1,777 1,676 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 2,224 751 1,473 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 1,397 294 1,103 Weston Corporate Center Second Quarter, 2010 1,145 1,145 Total $ 9,738 $ 4,079 $ 5,659 72 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased by approximately $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Other Operating Income and Expense Items Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property increased approximately $1.2 million, a 19% increase for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 PercentageChange Occupancy 77.9 % 75.1 % 3.7 % Average daily rate $ 197.29 $ 185.29 6.5 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 153.65 $ 139.19 10.4 % Development and Management Services Development and management services income increased approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Management fees increased by approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue in New York City. Following the satisfaction of the master lease agreement, the buyer terminated the property management and leasing agreement entered into at the time of the sale, resulting in the recognition of non cash deferred management fees totaling approximately $12.2 million. Development fees decreased by approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to the completion of our 20 F Street third party development project in the first quarter of 2010. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses increased approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to (1) approximately $4.0 million of accelerated expense of the remaining stock based compensation granted between 2006 and 2009 to Edward H. Linde, our late Chief Executive Officer, as a result of his passing on January 10, 2010, (2) an increase of approximately $1.3 million of other payroll related expense and (3) an approximately $0.6 million increase in other non compensatory general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $1.7 million in the value of our deferred compensation plan. On January 20, 2011, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved outperformance awards under our 1997 Plan to certain officers. These awards (the 2011 OPP Awards) are part of a broad based, long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team with the potential to earn equity awards subject to our outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure. 2011 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (TRS) over a three year measurement period as the performance metric and generally include two years of time based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2011 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2014, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $93.38 for the five trading days prior 73 Table of Contents to and including February 1, 2011. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2011 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $40.0 million. We expect that in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation, as of the grant date, the 2011 OPP Awards had an aggregate value of approximately $7.8 million, which amount is being amortized into earnings over the five year plan period under the graded vesting method. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $11.6 million and $11.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expense discussed above. Acquisition Costs Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to expense costs that an acquirer incurs to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million of acquisition costs associated with our acquisitions of 510 Madison Avenue in New York City and the John Hancock Tower and Garage in Boston, respectively. In addition for the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $0.2 million of acquisition costs associated with our acquisition of Bay Colony Corporate Center in Waltham, Massachusetts. Suspension of Development On February 6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 1,000,000 square foot project at 250 West 55th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a loss of approximately $27.8 million related to the suspension of development, which amount included a $20.0 million contractual amount due pursuant to a lease agreement. On January 19, 2010, we paid $12.8 million related to the termination of such lease. As a result, we recognized approximately $7.2 million of other income during the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Income and Expense Items Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009, income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $24.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009 we incurred non cash impairment losses on the Value Added Fund, which were not present during the year ended December 31, 2010, and therefore our share of the Value Added Funds net income increased by approximately $14.9 million. In June 2009 and December 2009, we recognized non cash impairment charges on our investment in the Value Added Fund of approximately $7.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. These charges represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying value of our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture. In accordance with guidance in ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (formerly known as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18)) a loss of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. If the fair value of our investments deteriorate further, we could recognize additional impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations. In addition, during December 2009, our Value Added Fund recognized a non cash impairment charge in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360 (formerly known as SFAS No. 144) related to our One and Two Circle Star Way properties in San Carlos, California totaling approximately $24.6 million, of which our share was approximately $4.2 million, which 74 Table of Contents amount reflects the reduction in our basis of approximately $2.0 million from previous impairment losses. The Value Added Fund was in discussions with the lender to modify the loan and as a result believed that the carrying value of the properties was not recoverable. Accordingly, the Value Added Fund recognized the non cash impairment charge to reduce the net book value of the properties to their estimated fair market value at December 31, 2009. On October 21, 2010, our Value Added Fund conveyed the fee simple title to its One and Two Circle Star Way properties and paid $3.8 million to the lender in satisfaction of its outstanding obligations under the existing mortgage loan and guarantee. In addition, (1) our share of the General Motors Buildings net income increased by approximately $6.7 million, which was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense related to two major tenant lease expirations, and (2) our share of the 125 West 55th Streets net income increased by approximately $2.9 million, which was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense associated with the refinancing of the propertys mortgage loan. The remaining increase of approximately $0.2 million related to the other unconsolidated joint venture properties. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of increased average cash balances offset by the net effect of lower overall interest rates. The average cash balances for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were approximately $1.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. Gains from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2009, investment in securities was comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund and investments in an account associated with our deferred compensation plan. In December 2007, the unregistered money market fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors could elect in kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund were previously valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized gains of approximately $0.2 million on our investment during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we no longer had investments in this unregistered money market fund. The remainder of the gains from investments in securities for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. Under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officers current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. In order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gains or losses from investments in securities. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 we recognized gains of approximately $0.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased by approximately $0.8 million and $2.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as a result of increases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan. 75 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 as detailed below: Component Change in interestexpense for theyear endedDecember 31, 2010andDecember 31, 2009 (in thousands) Increases to interest expense due to: Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.875% senior notes due 2019 on October 9, 2009 $ 31,786 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.625% senior notes due 2020 on April 19, 2010 27,702 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $850 million in aggregate principal of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 on November 18, 2010 4,345 Decrease in capitalized interest costs 7,835 New mortgage / properties placed in service financings 1,983 Total increases to interest expense $ 73,651 Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgage financings $ (8,562 ) Repurchases by our Operating Partnership of $236.3 million in aggregate principal of 2.875% exchangeable senior notes (5,507 ) Repurchases by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 6.25% senior notes due 2013 (2,190 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other (excluding senior notes) (2,146 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ (18,405 ) Total change in interest expense $ 55,246 The following properties are included in the repayment of mortgage financings line item: Reservoir Place, Eight Cambridge Center, Ten Cambridge Center, 1301 New York Avenue, 202, 206 & 214 Carnegie Center, South of Market, 10 and 20 Burlington Mall Road, 91 Hartwell Avenue and 1330 Connecticut Avenue. The following properties are included in the new mortgages/properties placed in service financings line item: Reservoir Place, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Place Office, 510 Madison Avenue and John Hancock Tower. As properties are placed in service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $41.0 million and $48.8 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. At December 31, 2010, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at Atlantic Wharf, our Unsecured Line of Credit, our secured financing at Reservoir Place and our cash secured financing at 510 Madison Avenue. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On December 12, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed the redemption of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013. The redemption price was determined in accordance with 76 Table of Contents the applicable indenture and was approximately $793.1 million. The redemption price included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 110.75% of the principal amount being redeemed. In addition, on November 29, 2010, we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury issue used in determining the redemption price on notional amounts aggregating $700.0 million. On December 9, 2010, we cash settled the treasury lock agreements and paid approximately $2.1 million. As a result of the payment of the redemption premium, the settlement of the treasury locks and the write off of deferred financing costs, we recognized an aggregate loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $79.3 million. Following the partial redemption, there is an aggregate of $225.0 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Operating Partnership repurchased approximately $236.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 for approximately $236.6 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate allocated liability and equity value of approximately $225.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we used available cash to repay approximately $501.2 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.3 million, wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we used available cash to repay approximately $98.4 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.5 million, wrote off approximately $42,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $32,000 related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. Gains on Sales of Real Estate On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale was deferred and has been recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $11.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed construction of the project and recognized the remaining gain on sale totaling approximately $1.8 million. We have recognized a cumulative gain on sale of approximately $23.4 million. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 was approximately $67.3 million. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement, resulting in the recognition of the remaining deferred gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $1.0 million. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. 77 Table of Contents On December 23, 2010, we acquired the outside members 33.3% equity interest in our consolidated joint venture entity that owns the Wisconsin Place Office property located in Chevy Chase, Maryland for cash of approximately $25.5 million. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810. The difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the outside members equity interest, totaling approximately $19.1 million, reduced additional paid in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership decreased by approximately $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in allocable income. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund development costs; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); cash flow from operations; distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership; and our Unsecured Line of Credit or other short term bridge facilities. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs. We generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be guaranteed. However, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the projects size and duration and our access to other sources of cost effective capital at the given time. 78 Table of Contents The following table presents information on properties under construction as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Construction Properties EstimatedStabilizationDate Location # ofBuildings Squarefeet Investmentto Date(1) EstimatedTotalInvestment(1) PercentageLeased(2) Office 510 Madison Avenue Third Quarter, 2013 New York, NY 1 347,000 $ 355,262 $ 375,000 45 % Annapolis Junction Lot Six (50% ownership)(3) Third Quarter, 2013 Annapolis, MD 1 120,000 9,215 14,000 0 % 12310 Sunrise Valley(4) First Quarter, 2012 Reston, VA 1 267,531 53,780 67,000 100 % 500 North Capitol (30% ownership)(3)(5) Fourth Quarter, 2013 Washington, DC 1 232,000 17,733 36,540 74 % Seventeen Cambridge Center Third Quarter, 2013 Cambridge, MA 1 190,329 23,976 86,300 100 % 250 West 55th Street(6) Fourth Quarter, 2015 New York, NY 1 989,000 532,606 1,050,000 19 % Total Office Properties under Construction 6 2,145,860 $ 992,572 $ 1,628,840 45 % Residential Reston Town Center Residential Fourth Quarter, 2015 Reston, VA 1 420,000 $ 25,041 $ 137,250 N/A Total Properties under Construction 7 2,565,860 $ 1,017,613 $ 1,766,090 45 % (1) Represents our share.

(4) We commenced redevelopment of 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive on July 5, 2011 and expect it to be available for occupancy during the first quarter of 2012. Project cost includes the incremental costs related to redevelopment and excludes original investment in the asset. (5) Project cost includes original investment in the joint venture. (6) Investment to Date excludes approximately $24.8 million of costs that were expensed in prior periods in connection with the suspension of development activities. Estimated Total Investment includes approximately $230 million of interest capitalization. Contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances and draws on our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to enable us to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our property management, leasing, and development and construction businesses, as well as the sale of assets from time to time. We believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs. Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund dividends and distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in the cash provided by our operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we fully utilized our $400 million ATM stock offering program by issuing an aggregate of 4,228,993 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $400 million and net proceeds of approximately $395 million. In addition, on June 2, 2011, we established a new ATM stock offering program through which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $600.0 million of our common stock through sales agents over a three year period. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we 79 Table of Contents issued an aggregate of 431,223 shares of common stock under this ATM stock offering program for gross proceeds of approximately $44.9 million and net proceeds of approximately $44.3 million. As of February 21, 2012, we have $555.1 million available for issuance under this program. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sales for general business purposes, which may include investment opportunities and debt reduction. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in short term, interest bearing securities. We believe this program provides us with an additional source of capital. During the year ended December 31, 2011, excluding financings and refinancing done by our unconsolidated joint ventures, we raised approximately $1.6 billion through secured and unsecured debt financings. We have utilized a portion of the proceeds to repay approximately $821 million of secured and unsecured debt. In addition, in February 2012 we repurchased/redeemed the remaining $576.2 million of our Operating Partnerships 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037. These transactions have elongated our debt maturity schedule and lowered our average cost of debt. We believe that our strong liquidity, including available cash as of February 21, 2012 of approximately $1.1 billion, and the approximately $750 million available under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit provides sufficient capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development projects, our foreseeable potential development activity and pursue attractive additional investment opportunities. Our most significant capital commitments through the remainder of 2012 are to fund our development program of approximately $361 million and repay, repurchase or refinance approximately $209 million of maturing debt. The completion of our ongoing development through late 2015 is expected to be fully funded by cash and available draws from construction loans. We believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital. REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend As a REIT we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. In December 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend from $0.50 per common share to $0.55 per common share. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate this current dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income, liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by our Board of Directors will not differ materially. Sales To the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. 80 Table of Contents Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On November 9, 2011, our Operating Partnership repurchased $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 for approximately $50.2 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate carrying value of approximately $49.6 million at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.6 million. On November 9, 2011, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our Reservoir Place property located in Waltham, Massachusetts totaling $50.0 million. The mortgage financing bore interest at a variable rate equal to Eurodollar plus 2.20% per annum and was scheduled to mature on July 30, 2014. There was no prepayment penalty. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. On November 16, 2011, we terminated the construction loan facility collateralized by our Atlantic Wharf property totaling $192.5 million. The construction loan facility bore interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum and was scheduled to mature on April 21, 2012 with two, one year extension options, subject to certain conditions. We did not draw any amounts under the facility. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.4 million consisting of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs. On December 12, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed the redemption of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013. The redemption price was determined in accordance with the applicable indenture and was approximately $793.1 million. The redemption price included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 110.75% of the principal amount being redeemed. In addition, on November 29, 2010, we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury issue used in determining the redemption price on notional amounts aggregating $700.0 million. On December 9, 2010, we cash settled the treasury lock agreements and paid approximately $2.1 million. As a result of the payment of the redemption premium, the settlement of the treasury locks and the write off of deferred financing costs, we recognized an aggregate loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $79.3 million. Following the partial redemption, there is an aggregate of $225.0 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Operating Partnership repurchased approximately $236.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 for approximately $236.6 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate allocated liability and equity value of approximately $225.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we used available cash to repay approximately $501.2 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling 67 Table of Contents approximately $0.3 million, wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. For a discussion of the redemption/repurchase in February 2012 of the approximately $576.2 million aggregate principal amount of our Operating Partnerships 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037, please see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gains on Sales of Real Estate On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale was deferred and has been recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed construction of the project and recognized the remaining gain on sale totaling approximately $1.8 million. We have recognized a cumulative gain on sale of approximately $23.4 million. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 was approximately $67.3 million. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement, resulting in the recognition of the remaining deferred gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $1.0 million. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships decreased by approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consisted of the outside owners equity interest in the income from our 505 9th Street property. For the year ended December 31, 2010, noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. On December 23, 2010, we acquired the outside members 33.3% equity interest in our consolidated joint venture entity that owns the Wisconsin Place Office property located in Chevy Chase, Maryland for cash of approximately $25.5 million. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810. The difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the outside members equity interest, totaling approximately $19.1 million, reduced additional paid in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership increased by approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 due to an increase in allocable income partially offset by a decrease in the noncontrolling interests ownership percentage. 68 Table of Contents Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 126 properties totaling approximately 29.9 million net rentable square feet of space, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures and structured parking. The Same Property Portfolio including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to January 1, 2009 and owned through December 31, 2010.

Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $32,800 and $30,385, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $25,153 and $23,966, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 70 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Rental Revenue Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio decreased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of approximately $2.1 million in rental revenue from our leases and a decrease in parking and other income of $1.9 million, coupled with an increase in other recoveries of approximately $0.9 million. The decrease in rental revenue from our leases of approximately $2.1 million was the result of our average revenue increasing by approximately $0.11 per square foot, contributing approximately $3.1 million, offset by an approximately $5.2 million decrease due to a decline in occupancy from 93.0% to 92.4%. Generally, under each of our leases, we are entitled to recover from the tenant increases in specific operating expenses associated with the leased property above the amount incurred for these operating expenses in the first year of the lease. The decrease in recoveries from tenants is primarily due to the terminations by tenants in New York City and a large lease expiration in Boston. Although the majority of the space was re leased, the new leases are in their first year during which, generally, no tenant recoveries are earned. Termination Income Termination income decreased by approximately $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to twenty three tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $9.2 million, which included (1) approximately $1.6 million from a small retail tenant in New York City, (2) approximately $4.1 million of negotiated termination income from our Reston, Virginia properties in order to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and to provide space early to a new tenant, (3) approximately $1.3 million from a tenant at 599 Lexington Avenue in New York City to accommodate growth of an existing tenant and (4) approximately $2.2 million spread across nineteen tenant terminations. Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to sixteen tenants across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately $14.4 million, which included (1) approximately $7.5 million of termination income related to a termination agreement with a tenant at 601 Lexington Avenue and (2) approximately $3.6 million was non cash income consisting of the estimated value of furniture and fixtures that two tenants transferred to us in connection with the terminations of their leases. Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio decreased approximately $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Included in Same Property Portfolio real estate operating expenses is a decrease in property general and administrative expenses of approximately $3.5 million, of which approximately $1.3 million is related to the write off in 2009 of a leasing commission associated with a tenant that did not take occupancy that did not recur in 2010. In addition, we had overall savings in repairs and maintenance and other property related expenses of approximately $2.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The savings in operating expenses were partially offset by an increase of approximately $1.0 million in insurance expense. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The increase consisted of (1) an approximately $11.7 million increase in the Washington, DC region that was primarily due to accelerated depreciation 71 Table of Contents associated with the future redevelopment of two of our buildings, (2) an increase in depreciation of approximately $3.9 million related to our properties in the Boston region, a portion of which was related to the amortization of tenant improvements costs and (3) an aggregate increase in the other regions of approximately $1.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an approximately $7.4 million decrease due to accelerated depreciation related to a lease termination in New York City that occurred during the second quarter of 2009. Properties Acquired Portfolio On December 29, 2010, we completed the acquisition of the John Hancock Tower and Garage in Boston, Massachusetts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $930.0 million. The John Hancock Tower is a 62 story, approximately 1,700,000 rentable square foot office tower located in the heart of Bostons Back Bay neighborhood. The garage is an eight level, 2,013 space parking facility. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the John Hancock Tower and Garage increased our revenue, real estate operating expenses and depreciation by approximately $0.9 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Properties Placed In Service Portfolio We had five properties totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet that were placed in service between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010. Rental Revenue Rental revenue from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $31.4 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Rental Revenue for theyear ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (in thousands) One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 $ 5,309 $ 1,516 $ 3,793 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 14,318 7,753 6,565 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 12,224 4,738 7,486 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 4,529 1,051 3,478 Weston Corporate Center Second Quarter, 2010 10,046 10,046 Total $ 46,426 $ 15,058 $ 31,368 Real Estate Operating Expenses Real estate operating expenses from our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased approximately $5.7 million, as detailed below: Property Quarter Placed In Service Real Estate Operating Expensesfor the year ended December 31, 2010 2009 Change (in thousands) One Preserve Parkway Second Quarter, 2009 $ 1,519 $ 1,257 $ 262 Wisconsin Place Office Second Quarter, 2009 3,453 1,777 1,676 Democracy Tower Third Quarter, 2009 2,224 751 1,473 701 Carnegie Center Fourth Quarter, 2009 1,397 294 1,103 Weston Corporate Center Second Quarter, 2010 1,145 1,145 Total $ 9,738 $ 4,079 $ 5,659 72 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense for our Properties Placed In Service Portfolio increased by approximately $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Other Operating Income and Expense Items Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property increased approximately $1.2 million, a 19% increase for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009: 2010 2009 PercentageChange Occupancy 77.9 % 75.1 % 3.7 % Average daily rate $ 197.29 $ 185.29 6.5 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 153.65 $ 139.19 10.4 % Development and Management Services Development and management services income increased approximately $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Management fees increased by approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue in New York City. Following the satisfaction of the master lease agreement, the buyer terminated the property management and leasing agreement entered into at the time of the sale, resulting in the recognition of non cash deferred management fees totaling approximately $12.2 million. Development fees decreased by approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to the completion of our 20 F Street third party development project in the first quarter of 2010. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses increased approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to (1) approximately $4.0 million of accelerated expense of the remaining stock based compensation granted between 2006 and 2009 to Edward H. Linde, our late Chief Executive Officer, as a result of his passing on January 10, 2010, (2) an increase of approximately $1.3 million of other payroll related expense and (3) an approximately $0.6 million increase in other non compensatory general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $1.7 million in the value of our deferred compensation plan. On January 20, 2011, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved outperformance awards under our 1997 Plan to certain officers. These awards (the 2011 OPP Awards) are part of a broad based, long term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team with the potential to earn equity awards subject to our outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay for performance structure. 2011 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders (TRS) over a three year measurement period as the performance metric and generally include two years of time based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2011 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three year measurement period from February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2014, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $93.38 for the five trading days prior 73 Table of Contents to and including February 1, 2011. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2011 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $40.0 million. We expect that in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation, as of the grant date, the 2011 OPP Awards had an aggregate value of approximately $7.8 million, which amount is being amortized into earnings over the five year plan period under the graded vesting method. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were approximately $11.6 million and $11.3 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expense discussed above. Acquisition Costs Effective January 1, 2009, we are required to expense costs that an acquirer incurs to effect a business combination such as legal, due diligence and other closing related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $1.5 million and $0.9 million of acquisition costs associated with our acquisitions of 510 Madison Avenue in New York City and the John Hancock Tower and Garage in Boston, respectively. In addition for the year ended December 31, 2010, we incurred approximately $0.2 million of acquisition costs associated with our acquisition of Bay Colony Corporate Center in Waltham, Massachusetts. Suspension of Development On February 6, 2009, we announced that we were suspending construction on our 1,000,000 square foot project at 250 West 55th Street in New York City. During December 2009, we completed the construction of foundations and steel/deck to grade to facilitate a restart of construction in the future and as a result ceased interest capitalization on the project. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a loss of approximately $27.8 million related to the suspension of development, which amount included a $20.0 million contractual amount due pursuant to a lease agreement. On January 19, 2010, we paid $12.8 million related to the termination of such lease. As a result, we recognized approximately $7.2 million of other income during the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Income and Expense Items Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009, income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately $24.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009 we incurred non cash impairment losses on the Value Added Fund, which were not present during the year ended December 31, 2010, and therefore our share of the Value Added Funds net income increased by approximately $14.9 million. In June 2009 and December 2009, we recognized non cash impairment charges on our investment in the Value Added Fund of approximately $7.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. These charges represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying value of our investment in the unconsolidated joint venture. In accordance with guidance in ASC 323 Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (formerly known as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock (APB No. 18)) a loss of an investment under the equity method of accounting, which is other than a temporary decline, must be recognized. If the fair value of our investments deteriorate further, we could recognize additional impairment charges that may be material to our results of operations. In addition, during December 2009, our Value Added Fund recognized a non cash impairment charge in accordance with the guidance in ASC 360 (formerly known as SFAS No. 144) related to our One and Two Circle Star Way properties in San Carlos, California totaling approximately $24.6 million, of which our share was approximately $4.2 million, which 74 Table of Contents amount reflects the reduction in our basis of approximately $2.0 million from previous impairment losses. The Value Added Fund was in discussions with the lender to modify the loan and as a result believed that the carrying value of the properties was not recoverable. Accordingly, the Value Added Fund recognized the non cash impairment charge to reduce the net book value of the properties to their estimated fair market value at December 31, 2009. On October 21, 2010, our Value Added Fund conveyed the fee simple title to its One and Two Circle Star Way properties and paid $3.8 million to the lender in satisfaction of its outstanding obligations under the existing mortgage loan and guarantee. In addition, (1) our share of the General Motors Buildings net income increased by approximately $6.7 million, which was primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense related to two major tenant lease expirations, and (2) our share of the 125 West 55th Streets net income increased by approximately $2.9 million, which was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense associated with the refinancing of the propertys mortgage loan. The remaining increase of approximately $0.2 million related to the other unconsolidated joint venture properties. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased approximately $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of increased average cash balances offset by the net effect of lower overall interest rates. The average cash balances for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were approximately $1.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. Gains from Investments in Securities We account for investments in trading securities at fair value, with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings. The designation of trading securities is generally determined at acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2009, investment in securities was comprised of an investment in an unregistered money market fund and investments in an account associated with our deferred compensation plan. In December 2007, the unregistered money market fund suspended cash redemptions by investors; investors could elect in kind redemptions of the underlying securities or maintain their investment in the fund and receive distributions as the underlying securities matured or were liquidated by the fund sponsor. As a result, we retained this investment for a longer term than originally intended, and the valuation of our investment was subject to changes in market conditions. Because interests in this fund were previously valued at less than their $1.00 par value, we recognized gains of approximately $0.2 million on our investment during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, we no longer had investments in this unregistered money market fund. The remainder of the gains from investments in securities for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to a deferred compensation plan that we maintain for our officers. Under this deferred compensation plan, each officer who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officers current income on a pre tax basis and receive a tax deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer. In order to reduce our market risk relating to this plan, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to our officers under the deferred compensation plan with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gains or losses from investments in securities. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 we recognized gains of approximately $0.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased by approximately $0.8 million and $2.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as a result of increases in our liability under our deferred compensation plan that were associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by our officers participating in the plan. 75 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 as detailed below: Component Change in interestexpense for theyear endedDecember 31, 2010andDecember 31, 2009 (in thousands) Increases to interest expense due to: Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.875% senior notes due 2019 on October 9, 2009 $ 31,786 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 5.625% senior notes due 2020 on April 19, 2010 27,702 Issuance by our Operating Partnership of $850 million in aggregate principal of 4.125% senior notes due 2021 on November 18, 2010 4,345 Decrease in capitalized interest costs 7,835 New mortgage / properties placed in service financings 1,983 Total increases to interest expense $ 73,651 Decreases to interest expense due to: Repayment of mortgage financings $ (8,562 ) Repurchases by our Operating Partnership of $236.3 million in aggregate principal of 2.875% exchangeable senior notes (5,507 ) Repurchases by our Operating Partnership of $700 million in aggregate principal of 6.25% senior notes due 2013 (2,190 ) Principal amortization of continuing debt and other (excluding senior notes) (2,146 ) Total decreases to interest expense $ (18,405 ) Total change in interest expense $ 55,246 The following properties are included in the repayment of mortgage financings line item: Reservoir Place, Eight Cambridge Center, Ten Cambridge Center, 1301 New York Avenue, 202, 206 & 214 Carnegie Center, South of Market, 10 and 20 Burlington Mall Road, 91 Hartwell Avenue and 1330 Connecticut Avenue. The following properties are included in the new mortgages/properties placed in service financings line item: Reservoir Place, Democracy Tower, Wisconsin Place Office, 510 Madison Avenue and John Hancock Tower. As properties are placed in service, we cease capitalizing interest and interest is then expensed. Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $41.0 million and $48.8 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. At December 31, 2010, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at Atlantic Wharf, our Unsecured Line of Credit, our secured financing at Reservoir Place and our cash secured financing at 510 Madison Avenue. Losses from Early Extinguishments of Debt On December 12, 2010, our Operating Partnership completed the redemption of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% senior notes due 2013. The redemption price was determined in accordance with 76 Table of Contents the applicable indenture and was approximately $793.1 million. The redemption price included approximately $17.9 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding such accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was approximately 110.75% of the principal amount being redeemed. In addition, on November 29, 2010, we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the yield on the U.S. Treasury issue used in determining the redemption price on notional amounts aggregating $700.0 million. On December 9, 2010, we cash settled the treasury lock agreements and paid approximately $2.1 million. As a result of the payment of the redemption premium, the settlement of the treasury locks and the write off of deferred financing costs, we recognized an aggregate loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $79.3 million. Following the partial redemption, there is an aggregate of $225.0 million of these notes outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2010, our Operating Partnership repurchased approximately $236.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 for approximately $236.6 million. The repurchased notes had an aggregate allocated liability and equity value of approximately $225.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, at the time of repurchase resulting in the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we used available cash to repay approximately $501.2 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.3 million, wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $0.4 million related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we used available cash to repay approximately $98.4 million of outstanding mortgage loans. Associated with the repayments, we paid a prepayment penalty totaling approximately $0.5 million, wrote off approximately $42,000 of unamortized deferred financing costs and recognized a gain of approximately $32,000 related to the write off of a remaining historical fair value balance. Gains on Sales of Real Estate On April 14, 2008, we sold a parcel of land located in Washington, DC for approximately $33.7 million. We had previously entered into a development management agreement with the buyer to develop a Class A office property on the parcel totaling approximately 165,000 net rentable square feet. Due to our involvement in the construction of the project, the gain on sale was deferred and has been recognized over the project construction period generally based on the percentage of total project costs incurred to estimated total project costs. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale during the year ended December 31, 2009 of approximately $11.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed construction of the project and recognized the remaining gain on sale totaling approximately $1.8 million. We have recognized a cumulative gain on sale of approximately $23.4 million. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement related to the 2006 sale of 280 Park Avenue, we entered into a master lease agreement with the buyer at closing. Under the master lease agreement, we guaranteed that the buyer will receive at least a minimum amount of base rent from approximately 74,340 square feet of space during the ten year period following the expiration of the leases for this space. The leases for this space expired at various times between June 2006 and October 2007. The aggregate amount of base rent we guaranteed over the entire period from 2006 to 2017 was approximately $67.3 million. On May 5, 2010, we satisfied the requirements of our master lease agreement, resulting in the recognition of the remaining deferred gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $1.0 million. Noncontrolling Interests in Property Partnerships Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships increased by approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009. Noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity owners interests in the income from our 505 9th Street and our Wisconsin Place Office properties. 77 Table of Contents On December 23, 2010, we acquired the outside members 33.3% equity interest in our consolidated joint venture entity that owns the Wisconsin Place Office property located in Chevy Chase, Maryland for cash of approximately $25.5 million. The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with ASC 810. The difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the outside members equity interest, totaling approximately $19.1 million, reduced additional paid in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership Noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership decreased by approximately $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in allocable income. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations, including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund development costs; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); cash flow from operations; distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; cash and cash equivalent balances; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our Operating Partnership; and our Unsecured Line of Credit or other short term bridge facilities. We believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our Unsecured Line of Credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs. Our Unsecured Line of Credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs. We generally seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may be guaranteed. However, the financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the projects size and duration and our access to other sources of cost effective capital at the given time. 78 Table of Contents The following table presents information on properties under construction as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Construction Properties EstimatedStabilizationDate Location # ofBuildings Squarefeet Investmentto Date(1) EstimatedTotalInvestment(1) PercentageLeased(2) Office 510 Madison Avenue Third Quarter, 2013 New York, NY 1 347,000 $ 355,262 $ 375,000 45 % Annapolis Junction Lot Six (50% ownership)(3) Third Quarter, 2013 Annapolis, MD 1 120,000 9,215 14,000 0 % 12310 Sunrise Valley(4) First Quarter, 2012 Reston, VA 1 267,531 53,780 67,000 100 % 500 North Capitol (30% ownership)(3)(5) Fourth Quarter, 2013 Washington, DC 1 232,000 17,733 36,540 74 % Seventeen Cambridge Center Third Quarter, 2013 Cambridge, MA 1 190,329 23,976 86,300 100 % 250 West 55th Street(6) Fourth Quarter, 2015 New York, NY 1 989,000 532,606 1,050,000 19 % Total Office Properties under Construction 6 2,145,860 $ 992,572 $ 1,628,840 45 % Residential Reston Town Center Residential Fourth Quarter, 2015 Reston, VA 1 420,000 $ 25,041 $ 137,250 N/A Total Properties under Construction 7 2,565,860 $ 1,017,613 $ 1,766,090 45 % (1) Represents our share.

(2) Represents percentage leased as of February 21, 2012 and excludes residential space. (3) This development project has a construction loan. (4) We commenced redevelopment of 12310 Sunrise Valley Drive on July 5, 2011 and expect it to be available for occupancy during the first quarter of 2012. Project cost includes the incremental costs related to redevelopment and excludes original investment in the asset. (5) Project cost includes original investment in the joint venture. (6) Investment to Date excludes approximately $24.8 million of costs that were expensed in prior periods in connection with the suspension of development activities. Estimated Total Investment includes approximately $230 million of interest capitalization. Contractual rental revenue, recoveries from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances and draws on our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to enable us to maintain our REIT qualification. We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our property management, leasing, and development and construction businesses, as well as the sale of assets from time to time. We believe our revenue, together with our cash balances and proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs. Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund dividends and distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in the cash provided by our operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit and unsecured senior notes. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we fully utilized our $400 million ATM stock offering program by issuing an aggregate of 4,228,993 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $400 million and net proceeds of approximately $395 million. In addition, on June 2, 2011, we established a new ATM stock offering program through which we may sell from time to time up to an aggregate of $600.0 million of our common stock through sales agents over a three year period. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we 79 Table of Contents issued an aggregate of 431,223 shares of common stock under this ATM stock offering program for gross proceeds of approximately $44.9 million and net proceeds of approximately $44.3 million. As of February 21, 2012, we have $555.1 million available for issuance under this program. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sales for general business purposes, which may include investment opportunities and debt reduction. Pending such uses, we may invest the net proceeds in short term, interest bearing securities. We believe this program provides us with an additional source of capital. During the year ended December 31, 2011, excluding financings and refinancing done by our unconsolidated joint ventures, we raised approximately $1.6 billion through secured and unsecured debt financings. We have utilized a portion of the proceeds to repay approximately $821 million of secured and unsecured debt. In addition, in February 2012 we repurchased/redeemed the remaining $576.2 million of our Operating Partnerships 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037. These transactions have elongated our debt maturity schedule and lowered our average cost of debt. We believe that our strong liquidity, including available cash as of February 21, 2012 of approximately $1.1 billion, and the approximately $750 million available under our Operating Partnerships Unsecured Line of Credit provides sufficient capacity to fund our remaining capital requirements on existing development projects, our foreseeable potential development activity and pursue attractive additional investment opportunities. Our most significant capital commitments through the remainder of 2012 are to fund our development program of approximately $361 million and repay, repurchase or refinance approximately $209 million of maturing debt. The completion of our ongoing development through late 2015 is expected to be fully funded by cash and available draws from construction loans. We believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet are attractive to lenders and equity investors current investment selectivity and should enable us to continue to access multiple sources of capital. REIT Tax Distribution Considerations Dividend As a REIT we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we currently distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income. Our policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax. In December 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend from $0.50 per common share to $0.55 per common share. Our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate this current dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income, liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by our Board of Directors will not differ materially. Sales To the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. 80 Table of Contents Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. In the aggregate, during the fourth quarter of 2011, we signed leases for approximately 1.3 million square feet of space and incurred aggregate tenant related obligations of approximately $62.4 million, or approximately $48 per square foot. 96 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Venture Indebtedness We have investments in twelve unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 25% to 60%. Nine of these ventures have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2011, the aggregate debt, including both our and our partners share, incurred by these ventures was approximately $3.0 billion (of which our proportionate share is approximately $1.4 billion). The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2011. In addition to other guarantees specifically noted in the table, we have agreed to customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) on certain of the loans.

All adjustments to reflect loans at their fair value upon acquisition are noted above. (2) The loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. (3) In connection with the assumption of the loan, we guaranteed the joint ventures obligation to fund various escrows, including tenant improvements, taxes and insurance in lieu of cash deposits. As of December 31, 2011, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $20.5 million. We earn a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and have an agreement with our partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. (4) Principal amount does not include the assumed mezzanine loan with an aggregate principal amount of $294.0 million and a stated rate of 6.02% per annum, as the venture acquired the lenders interest in this loan for a purchase price of approximately $263.1 million in cash. (5) In connection with the capitalization of the joint venture, loans totaling $450.0 million were funded by the ventures partners on a pro rata basis. Our share of the partner loans totaling $270.0 million has been reflected in Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (6) In connection with the refinancing of this propertys secured loan by the joint venture, we have guaranteed the joint ventures obligation to fund an escrow related to certain lease rollover costs in lieu of an initial cash deposit for the full amount. The maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was $21.3 million. At closing, the joint venture funded a $10.0 million cash deposit into an escrow account and the remaining $11.3 million will be further reduced with scheduled monthly deposits from operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2011, the remaining funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately $1.8 million. We earn a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and have an agreement with the outside partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. (7) In connection with the assumption of the loan, we guaranteed the joint ventures obligation to fund tenant improvements and leasing commissions. (8) Mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum and matures on March 31, 2018 with one, three year extension option, subject to certain conditions. (9) The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.65% per annum and matures on November 17, 2013 with two, one year extension options, subject to certain conditions. (10) This property is owned by the Value Added Fund. (11) The mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum. 97 Table of Contents (12) In conjunction with the mortgage loan modification our Operating partnership agreed to lend up to $6.0 million to the Value Added Fund, of which approximately $3.7 million had been advanced as of December 31, 2011. The loan from our Operating Partnership bears interest at a fixed rate of 10.0% per annum and matures on November 22, 2014. This loan has been reflected in Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (13) The mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum. (14) In conjunction with the mortgage loan modification, our Operating Partnership agreed to lend up to $12.0 million to our Value Added Fund, of which approximately $6.4 million has been advanced to date. The loan from our Operating Partnership bears interest at a fixed rate of 10.0% per annum and matures on May 31, 2014. This loan has been reflected in Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and or groundwater handling procedures and or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision making process with respect to the acquisition and or 98 Table of Contents development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. Pre purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have developed an office park on this Property. Prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. Reclassifications and Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been revised as a result of the adoption on January 1, 2009 of (1) ASC 470 20 (formerly known as FSP No. APB 14 1) (See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements), (2) the guidance included in ASC 810 Consolidation (formerly known as SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160)) and ASC 480 10 S99 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (formerly known as EITF Topic No. D 98 Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities (Amended) and (3) the guidance included in ASC 260 10 Earnings Per Share (formerly known as FSP EITF 03 06 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities ) (See Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations. 99 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As of December 31, 2011, approximately $8.7 billion of our consolidated borrowings bore interest at fixed rates and none of our consolidated borrowings bore interest at variable rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates.
