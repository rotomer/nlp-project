Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)," and in particular the Outlook section of this MD&A, contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of and assumptions made by management, as well as information currently available to management. When used in this document, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, some of which are described below in the section "Risks and Uncertainties." Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this document as anticipated, believed, estimated, or expected. We do not intend to update these forward looking statements except as may be required by law. 11 Back to Index Introduction Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. The MD&A is organized as follows: Nature of Business This section provides a general description of our business and our Business Model. Performance Indicators This section discusses several metrics that may be used to assess our financial results and condition. Results of Operations This section discusses our results of operations for all three years presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2004 This section provides forward looking statements about our expected performance for fiscal year 2004 based on currently available information. Selected Quarterly Information This section provides financial information about revenue and net loss on a quarterly basis for the last two fiscal years. Liquidity and Capital Resources This section provides an analysis of our cash flows, as well as a discussion of our outstanding debt as of March 31, 2003. In addition, this section provides an analysis of the financial capacity available to fund our future commitments, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements This section discusses commitments that we have that are not accounted for on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2003. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The section provides an analysis of our contractual arrangements, including outstanding debt, as of March 31, 2003. Critical Accounting Policies and Business Practices This section discusses those accounting policies and business practices that we consider important to our financial results and condition. Generally, these policies and practices require significant judgment and estimates. In addition, our significant accounting policies, including those considered critical, are summarized in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting Pronouncements This section provides an analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements. The analysis includes a discussion of when the new pronouncements are effective for us and what the expected impact will be on our financial results and condition. Risk Factors This section provides a description of risk factors that could adversely affect our revenue, profitability, and cash flow in the future. Nature of Business As described in greater detail in Part I of this Form 10 K, we license our software products directly to customers as well as to distribution partners, resellers, and VARs. We generate revenues from the following sources: license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis; maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements; and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation, consulting, and education services. The timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a period are determined individually by license agreement, based on its duration and specific terms. In October 2000, we announced the shift to our existing Business Model that offers customers greater flexibility to change how they can use and license our software products as their business changes. This flexibility reduces the customers risks and up front financial commitment associated with traditional software licensing models. Under our Business Model, customers can better manage the duration and dollar value of their software licenses. Our Business Model provides customers with the flexibility to subscribe to software under month to month licenses or fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements. Our Business Model also permits customers to change their software mix as their business and technology needs change. This includes the right to receive software in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee. We believe our Business Model improves the predictability of our revenue streams, since we recognize license revenue evenly on a monthly basis, or "ratably," over the life of the license agreement. Under our prior business model, and as is common practice in the software industry, most of these license fees were recorded up front at the time the license agreement was signed and the software was delivered. Under our Business Model, the portion of the license revenue that is not recognized currently creates what we refer to as "deferred subscription revenue." This deferred subscription revenue will be recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the terms of the license agreements. When recognized, this revenue will be recorded on the "Subscription revenue" line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue, the amount deferred is reported as a liability titled "Deferred subscription revenue (collected)," on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Otherwise, deferred subscription revenue is reported as a reduction of the accounts receivable (the contractual amount due from the customer). 12 Back to Index Performance Indicators The following is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators that may be used to assess our financial results and condition: For the Year Ended March 31, 2003 2002 Change Percent Change (dollars in millions) Subscription revenue Total revenue Subscription revenue as a percent of total revenue New deferred subscription revenue Weighted average license agreement duration in years Cash from operations Net loss $ $ $ 1,414 3,116 45% 1,883 2.81 1,309 (267 ) $ $ $ 827 2,964 28% 2,178 3.67 1,251 (1,102 ) $ $ $ 587 152 (295 (.86 58 835 ) ) 71% 5% 61% (14% (23% 5% 76% ) ) As of March 31, 2003 2002 Change Percent Change (dollars in millions) Total debt $ 3,126 $ 3,842 $ (716 ) (19% ) Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue is the ratable revenue recognized in a period from amounts previously recorded as deferred subscription revenue. Subscription revenue also includes revenue earned from monthly licenses. The larger the ratio of subscription revenue to total revenue, the more predictable our revenue streams become. A change in subscription revenue is correlated with a change in deferred subscription revenue, and therefore, since we expect an increase in deferred subscription revenue, we also expect subscription revenue to increase in fiscal year 2004. Total Revenue Total revenue is the sum of all revenue line items. Although subscription revenue continues to increase, certain other revenue line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations are decreasing. As we noted in our previous filings, these decreases were generally expected. We expected decreases in the Maintenance, Financing fees, and Professional services line items as described in further detail below. Software fees and other, which largely represents software revenues from our channel and OEM business, decreased more than we expected in fiscal year 2003. For a more complete description of the reasons why each revenue item increased or decreased, refer to the Results of Operations section below. New Deferred Subscription Revenue New deferred subscription revenue represents the total undiscounted incremental value (license agreement value) of all new software licenses sold in the current period by our direct sales force. New deferred subscription revenue excludes the value associated with license agreements for maintenance only as well as professional service arrangements. This new deferred subscription revenue is what we expect to collect from our customers. This amount is recorded into subscription revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the applicable software license term. These license agreements represent binding payment commitments from customers over periods generally up to three years. Weighted Average License Agreement Duration in Years The weighted average license agreement duration in years represents the sum of the duration of all software licenses executed during a fiscal year, weighted by each individual software licenses contract value. The calculation for fiscal year 2003 of 2.81 years was derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts recorded and weighted average durations in years, respectively: Q1 $322 million, 2.75 years; Q2 $394 million, 2.80 years; Q3 $538 million, 2.80 years; and Q4 $629 million, 2.85 years. For fiscal year 2002, the calculation of 3.67 years was derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts recorded and weighted average durations in years, respectively: Q1 $502 million, 4.00 years; Q2 $466 million, 3.75 years; Q3 $554 million, 3.50 years; and Q4 $656 million, 3.50 years. We believe license agreement durations averaging approximately three years, which is lower than the historical duration of our contracts, increase the value the customer receives from our software licenses by giving customers the flexibility to vary their software mix as their needs change. We also believe this flexibility improves our customer relationships and encourages greater accountability by the Company to each of our customers, which in turn may lead to increased future sales opportunities. Cash From Operations Cash from operations from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows represents the excess of cash collected from billings to our customers over cash paid for expenses to run our business. This amount represents what is available to pay for equipment, technology, and other investing activities, to repay debt, pay dividends, buy back stock, or for other financing purposes. We believe this is an important performance indicator since cash generation over the long term is essential to maintaining a healthy business and providing funds to help fuel growth. We believe generating consistently strong cash from operations is an indication that we are achieving a high level of customer satisfaction with our products and are appropriately managing our expenses. 13 Back to Index Net Loss Under our Business Model, revenue is deferred and recognized evenly on a monthly basis whereas under the prior business model, license revenue was generally recognized up front. However, costs continued to be expensed as incurred. As a result, we have experienced net losses. As we increase revenue and maintain our cost structure, we anticipate returning to a net profit. The decrease in net loss from fiscal year 2002 to 2003 was attributable to, among other things, our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," whereby we no longer amortize goodwill. Goodwill amortization was approximately $449 million in fiscal year 2002. Total Debt Total debt includes the current and long term portions of our debt obligations. We have made a strategic decision to reduce our overall debt level and have achieved a $1.3 billion reduction during the last two fiscal years. Refer to the discussion of our Results of Operations and Risk Factors herein and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the items discussed in this section. Results of Operations The following table presents the percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.

Total Revenue Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 increased $152 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 to $3.116 billion. This increase was primarily due to the transition to our Business Model that began during the third quarter of fiscal year 2001. This transition resulted in an increase in subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year, partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and financing fees as described below. Professional services and software fees and other revenue decreased for fiscal year 2003 as described below. In addition, there was a positive impact to revenue of $81 million compared to fiscal year 2002 due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This foreign exchange rate impact was fully offset by the impact of the sale of our interBiz unit in April 2002, which had contributed approximately $82 million of revenue in fiscal year 2002. Cautious capital spending by our existing and potential customers associated with weak conditions in the overall economy and the IT industry adversely impacted bookings of new license agreements and revenue in fiscal year 2003. 14 Back to Index Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 decreased $1.226 billion from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001, to $2.964 billion. This decrease was primarily due to the transition to our Business Model beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2001, which resulted in a decrease in license fees recognized up front compared to the prior year period, partially offset by new subscription revenue. The period that license agreements were recorded prior to our Business Model is deemed the "prior business model." In addition, apprehension toward capital spending by our existing and potential customers due to weakened conditions in the overall economy and the technology industry also impacted fiscal year 2002 revenue. During fiscal year 2001, approximately $1.429 billion was recognized as revenue up front at license agreement signing under our prior business model and was included in the "Software fees and other" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The total revenue decrease was also attributable to a decline in professional services revenue of $222 million, as described below. Although the transition to our Business Model and weaker economic conditions contributed to the revenue decrease, quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on such decrease is not readily determinable. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 increased $587 million from fiscal year 2002 to $1.414 billion. Subscription revenue represents the ratable portion of revenue recognized on software license agreements entered into under our Business Model. Many of the licenses recorded between October 2000, when our Business Model began, and the end of fiscal year 2002, have terms of three years or greater. Therefore, many did not expire during fiscal year 2003, and continue to contribute to subscription revenue on a monthly, ratable basis. As a result, subscription revenue for fiscal year 2003 includes the ratable recognition of bookings recorded in fiscal year 2003, as well as most of the bookings recorded between October 2000 and the end of fiscal year 2002. This is the main reason for the increase in subscription revenue in fiscal year 2003 versus fiscal year 2002. During fiscal years 2003 and 2002, we added new deferred subscription revenue of $1.883 billion and $2.178 billion, respectively. The approximate duration of license agreements executed under our Business Model in fiscal year 2003 and 2002 was a weighted average life of approximately 2.81 years and 3.67 years, respectively. Thus, annualized deferred subscription revenue, which represents the total value of all new software license agreements signed during a period divided by the weighted average duration of all such license agreements recorded during the same period, increased approximately $77 million, or 13%, for fiscal year 2003 over the prior fiscal year to $670 million. Subscription revenue also increased as a result of how we record maintenance revenue under our Business Model compared to the prior method. Under our prior business model, maintenance revenue was separately identified and was recorded to the "Maintenance" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under our Business Model, bundled maintenance is not separately identified in our customers license agreements and therefore is included within the "Subscription revenue" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the increase in subscription revenue is not readily determinable. Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 increased $768 million from the prior fiscal year to $827 million. The increase was primarily due to the introduction of our Business Model that began in the third quarter of fiscal year 2001. Fiscal year 2002 included subscription revenue earned from software license agreements that were completed during the 12 months of fiscal year 2002. These license agreements did not contribute to revenue in fiscal year 2001. During fiscal years 2002 and 2001 we added new deferred subscription revenue of $2.178 billion and $1.934 billion, respectively. Software Fees and Other Software fees and other primarily consists of royalties and revenue related to distribution and OEM partners. Revenue related to distribution partners and OEMs is sometimes referred to as our "indirect" or "channel" revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, software fees and other decreased $37 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 to $395 million. The decrease was primarily due to a difficult economic and competitive environment. Software fees and other decreased during fiscal year 2002 by $1.449 billion from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2001 to $432 million. During fiscal year 2001, the portion of revenue that we recognized up front at the signing of a new license agreement under our prior business model of approximately $1.429 billion was recorded to the "Software fees and other" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2001, we switched to our Business Model and no longer recorded this revenue up front. Maintenance As expected, maintenance revenue for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 decreased $189 million and $129 million, respectively, from the respective prior fiscal years to $769 million and $958 million, respectively. The decrease in maintenance revenue for both years is attributable to additional license agreements signed under our Business Model where bundled maintenance revenue is now included with license revenue, which is reported in the "Subscription revenue" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The combined maintenance and license revenue on these types of license agreements is recognized on a monthly basis ratably over the term of the agreement. The decrease is partially offset by new maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance at the expiration of their non term based license agreements. The quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the decrease in maintenance revenue is not readily determinable. 15 Back to Index Financing Fees Financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under our prior business model, which required up front revenue recognition. This discount initially reduced the related installment accounts receivable, and was referred to as "unamortized discounts." Over the life of the applicable license agreement, the related unamortized discount is amortized and reported as financing fees. Under our Business Model, additional unamortized discounts are no longer recorded, since we do not account for the present value of product sales as earned revenue when license agreements are signed. As expected, for fiscal years 2003 and 2002, financing fees decreased $154 million and $194 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $290 million and $444 million, respectively. The decrease for both years is attributable to the discontinuance of offering license agreements under our prior business model. Professional Services Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2003 decreased $55 million from fiscal year 2002 to $248 million. The decrease was partially attributable to the divestiture of our interBiz unit in April 2002, which generated approximately $20 million of professional services revenue in fiscal year 2002. The decrease was also a result of the weak spending environment that affected the IT service sector in general, as well as our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products. Quantification of the impact that these factors had on the decrease in professional services revenue is not readily determinable. Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2002 decreased $222 million from fiscal year 2001 to $303 million primarily as a result of our shift in focus to professional services engagements that are centered around our products. The decrease was also attributable to our divestiture in October 2000 of Sterlings Federal Systems Group (FSG), a provider of professional services to governmental agencies, which contributed approximately $94 million to professional services revenue in fiscal year 2001. Total Revenue by Geography Revenue in the United States represented approximately 58% of overall revenue for fiscal year 2003, as compared to approximately 62% for fiscal year 2002. International revenue increased $185 million, or 17%, in fiscal year 2003 as compared with fiscal year 2002. Results in fiscal year 2002 included our interBiz operations, which we divested in April 2002. Those operations contributed approximately $50 million and $32 million of revenue in the prior fiscal year from the United States and international regions, respectively. The increases in international revenue were primarily attributable to an improvement in our business in Europe and Asia as well as the $81 million positive impact due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue in the United States represented 62% of overall revenue for fiscal year 2002, as compared to 65% for fiscal year 2001. Consistent with the reasons for the overall decrease in revenue, international revenue decreased $343 million, or 23%, in fiscal year 2002 as compared with fiscal year 2001. Price changes did not have a material impact in fiscal years 2003, 2002, or 2001. Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and capitalized internally generated software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software costs are related to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage. Amortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal year 2003 decreased $17 million from the prior fiscal year to $470 million and for fiscal year 2002, decreased $5 million from fiscal year 2001 to $487 million. We recorded amortization of purchased software products for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 of $435 million, $455 million, and $467 million, respectively. We recorded amortization of capitalized internally generated software development costs for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 of $35 million, $32 million, and $25 million, respectively. The total decrease for both years was due primarily to certain purchased software assets becoming fully amortized. Cost of Professional Services Cost of professional services consists primarily of the personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2003 decreased $46 million from fiscal year 2002 to $237 million. This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in professional service engagements and related personnel costs. 16 Back to Index Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2002 decreased $180 million from fiscal year 2001 to $283 million. This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in professional service engagements and related personnel costs, including the divestiture of FSG, which contributed approximately $84 million of such expenses in the prior year. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2003 decreased $296 million compared to fiscal year 2002 to $1.463 billion. The decrease was attributable to our emphasis on overall cost control measures, including a reduction in personnel and personnel related costs. During fiscal year 2003, we had an average of approximately 16,000 employees. This represents a decrease of approximately 1,500 employees from our fiscal year 2002 average of 17,500 employees, some of which were personnel costs that impacted other line items. The reduction in headcount consisted of a reduction in workforce of approximately 900 employees in October 2001, approximately 725 employees from the divestiture of certain assets of our interBiz operations in April 2002, and approximately 80 employees from the divestiture of our banking product group in October 2002. This reduction was partially offset by headcount additions in the current year primarily due to the opening of a new call center for telemarketing efforts. Our interBiz unit contributed approximately $81 million of SG&A expenses in the prior fiscal year, the majority of which were personnel costs. The decrease in SG&A expenses was also attributable to a reduction of the bad debt expense of $151 million, which relates to ongoing operations, and $14 million of bad debt expense that was recorded in fiscal year 2002 prior to the divestiture of the interBiz unit in April 2002. This reduction reflects a decrease in installment accounts receivable related to the prior business model (see the Accounts Receivable section of Critical Accounting Policies and Business Practices for additional information). In fiscal year 2002, we recorded a $28 million capitalized software impairment charge. This amount was previously recorded as part of the fiscal year 2002 total impairment charge of $59 million related to the sale of interBiz. SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2002 decreased $361 million compared to fiscal year 2001 to $1.759 billion. The decrease was largely attributable to our emphasis on overall cost control measures, including a reduction in personnel and personnel related costs, such as reduced travel expenses, in connection with a reduction in our headcount of approximately 3,000 employees over the prior fiscal year. In fiscal year 2001, we recorded a charge associated with the bankruptcy of Inacom Corporation of approximately $31 million. Product Development and Enhancements Product development and enhancement expenditures, also referred to as research and development, for fiscal year 2003 decreased $14 million compared to fiscal year 2002 to $664 million. As a percentage of operating expenses, net research and development expenditures increased to approximately 20% in the current fiscal year, compared to approximately 19% in the prior fiscal year, excluding the amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce from fiscal year 2002 operating expenses. We continued to focus on product development and enhancements, emerging technologies such as Linux, wireless and web services, and a broadening of our enterprise product offerings. Product development and enhancement expenditures for fiscal year 2002 decreased $17 million from fiscal year 2001 to $678 million. The decrease was a result of general cost containment, primarily related to personnel costs. We continued our focus on product development and enhancements, with an emphasis on adapting and enhancing products within our focus areas, particularly for the distributed processing and IBMs z/OS environments, as well as a broadening of our enterprise product offerings. Commissions and Royalties Commissions and royalties for fiscal year 2003 decreased $24 million from fiscal year 2002 to $251 million. This decrease was due primarily to an $11 million reduction in royalties paid to third parties resulting from continued internal product development and enhancements. This decrease was also due to the reduction in sales and related commission expense associated with the divestiture of certain assets of our interBiz unit. That unit contributed approximately $9 million of such expenses in fiscal year 2002. Commissions and royalties for fiscal year 2002 decreased $33 million from fiscal year 2001 to $275 million. Commissions and royalties expense as a percentage of revenue increased due to the lower revenue achievement associated with our transition to our Business Model without an associated change in the overall sales compensation. The decrease in commissions and royalties expense was principally the result of a decline in license agreement bookings associated with the weaker economic environment for IT spending. Depreciation and Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year 2003 decreased $467 million from fiscal year 2002 to $142 million. The decrease was primarily a result of adopting SFAS No. 142 in April 2002. With SFAS No. 142, a non amortization fair value based impairment approach is used to account for goodwill and certain intangible assets (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, assembled workforce no longer met the definition of an identifiable intangible asset and, therefore, must be reclassified to goodwill and follow the non amortization impairment approach. As a result, the assembled workforce net balance of $79 million as of March 31, 2002 was reclassified to goodwill. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we amortized $449 million and $13 million of goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible asset, respectively, during fiscal year 2002. On a per share basis, we recorded $.78 and $.02 of goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible asset amortization, respectively, during fiscal year 2002. 17 Back to Index Depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year 2002 decreased $9 million from fiscal year 2001 to $609 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets from past acquisitions becoming fully amortized. Goodwill Impairment During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, we performed our annual goodwill impairment review under SFAS No. 142 and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $80 million related to our professional services organization. The impairment is attributable to our lower than expected results and our projected performance. See the Critical Accounting Policies and Business Practices section for additional information. Under the provisions of SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $59 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. The charge related to the sale of certain assets, under the name interBiz, to SSA in April 2002. The $59 million consisted of a $31 million goodwill impairment charge recorded to the "Goodwill impairment" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and a $28 million capitalized software impairment charge recorded to the "SG&A" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 1995 Stock Plan In fiscal year 2001, we recorded a gain of $184 million related to the settlement of the 1995 Key Employee Stock Ownership Plan (1995 Stock Plan) litigation. Under the terms of the settlement, the 1995 Stock Plan participants returned 4.5 million shares of CA stock to the Company. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense for fiscal year 2003 decreased $55 million as compared to fiscal year 2002 to $172 million. Of the change, $38 million was due to the decrease in average debt outstanding, $14 million was due to the decrease in the average variable interest rate, and $3 million was the result of gains from the early retirement of portions of our outstanding debt. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and New Accounting Pronouncements regarding SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections" for additional information. Net interest expense for fiscal year 2002 decreased $117 million as compared to fiscal year 2001 to $227 million. Of the change, $59 million was due to the decrease in average debt outstanding and $58 million was due to the decrease in the average variable interest rate. Operating Margins For fiscal year 2003, our pretax loss was $363 million as compared to a pretax loss of $1.385 billion in fiscal year 2002. The decrease in pretax loss was primarily related to: An increase in revenue of $152 million; A reduction in expenses of $408 million, or 10%, for fiscal year 2003, excluding the amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce in fiscal year 2002; and The elimination of amortization of goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible asset as of April 1, 2002, in accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which totaled $462 million in fiscal year 2002. Income Tax Benefit Our consolidated effective tax rate (benefit) was 26% and 20% for fiscal years 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increased effective tax rate reflects the goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible assets that were amortized for financial statement purposes but not for tax purposes prior to fiscal year 2003, net of the fiscal year 2003 goodwill impairment charge. Beginning with adoption of SFAS No. 142, these assets are no longer amortized for either financial statement or tax purposes. Our effective tax rate (benefit) is below the statutory rate in fiscal year 2003 primarily due to the non tax deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge. Our effective tax rate (benefit) is below the statutory rate in fiscal year 2002 primarily due to the non tax deductibility of goodwill amortization. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2004 This outlook for fiscal year 2004 contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs and assumptions made by management, as well as information currently available to management. Should business conditions change or should our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described below. We do not intend to update these projections. 18 Back to Index The outlook for the overall economy and the IT environment, complicated by recent international conflicts, continues to be difficult to predict. The outlook for our fiscal year 2004 results comes from the assumption that there will be limited to modest improvement in the current economic and IT environments. We also believe that customers will continue to be cautious with their technology purchases. Our preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2004 is to generate revenue in the range of $3.275 billion to $3.425 billion, an increase of between 5% to 10%, and loss per share in the range of $(.10) to $(.05). We expect that: Subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue, as well as annualized deferred subscription revenue, should continue to increase during fiscal year 2004 for the same reasons as described in Results of Operations for the fiscal year 2003 increase; Our weighted average license agreement duration will continue to be approximately 3 years; The level of business from distribution and OEM partners for fiscal year 2004 should remain steady or increase slightly from that of fiscal year 2003 as new products are brought to market and organizational improvements initiated during the second half of fiscal year 2003 are realized; Maintenance revenue as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations should continue to decrease as deferred maintenance revenue previously recorded under our prior business model is amortized over the term of the license agreement. Under our Business Model, maintenance revenue is now included with license revenue and, therefore, will be recorded on the "Subscription revenue line" item. We expect this decrease to be partially offset by new revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance at the expiration of their non term based license agreements; Financing fees will continue to decrease; The level of professional service engagements for fiscal year 2004 should be similar to that of fiscal year 2003. The formation of the CATS organization in April 2003 should result in increased efficiency in our services organization; The cost control measures implemented to date should enable us to report improved fiscal year 2004 SG&A costs, both in total and as a percentage of total revenue compared with those reported in fiscal year 2003; Product development and enhancement expenditures should remain steady and continue to constitute a significant portion of total operating expenses in fiscal year 2004, since such investment is essential to maintaining and improving our competitive position; Our debt level should decrease by approximately $825 million in fiscal year 2004; and The effective tax rate (benefit) for fiscal year 2004 should be approximately 36%. The increase in the tax rate results from the impact of the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge of $80 million recorded in fiscal year 2003. We currently maintain stock option plans and restricted stock award plans for fiscal year 2003 and all prior years. We accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB No. 25) and related interpretations. No stock based employee compensation expense for stock options was reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended March 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to or above the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Effective April 1, 2003, we have adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123." We will recognize compensation expense related to all option awards granted after March 31, 2003 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We will continue to disclose the effect of option awards granted prior to March 31, 2003 on a pro forma basis in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Beginning in fiscal year 2004, we adopted the fair value based method of recording stock options outlined in SFAS No. 123. As a result of evolving practice, stock options will be considered employee compensation expense, and therefore it is appropriate that the computed value will be recorded in our financial results. We have historically used the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk free interest rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control. The following table sets forth the various estimated effects on future earnings (loss) per share as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123 using the fair market value of our stock as of March 31, 2003 (base price). For purposes of this table, we have assumed 6.4 million option shares are awarded in the last month of each fiscal year, which is consistent with fiscal year 2003, but may not be indicative of future option grants approved by the Board of Directors. We have assumed all other variables to be the same as those used for fiscal year 2003, as detailed in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 19 Back to Index Assumed Exercise Price Year Ended March 31, of Stock Option Award 2004(1) 2005 2006 2007 2008 $13.66 (base price) $ $ (.02 ) $ (.05 ) $ (.07 ) $ (.07 ) $10.25 (25% below base price) (.02 ) (.04 ) (.05 ) (.05 ) $17.08 (25% above base price) (.03 ) (.06 ) (.09 ) (.09 ) $20.49 (50% above base price) (.04 ) (.07 ) (.11 ) (.11 ) (1) As a result of the assumption of issuing stock options in the last month of the fiscal year, the compensation expense is expected to be negligible. The above table provides sensitivity analysis related to the granting of stock options and the associated expense incurred over the vesting period of the option. The assumptions used may vary significantly, which can result in a material change to the amounts presented above.

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In fiscal year 2002, we amortized on a quarterly basis goodwill and assembled workforce in the aggregate amount of $462 million ($.80 per share). (2) Includes an after tax charge of $80 million related to an impairment of goodwill. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (3) Includes an after tax charge of $49 million related to an impairment of assets sold in April 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $1.512 billion on March 31, 2003, an increase of $332 million from the March 31, 2002 balance of $1.180 billion. Net debt repayments approximated $700 million during fiscal year 2003. We used cash on hand and cash from operations to repay more than $1.2 billion in outstanding debt, which was offset by the issuance of $460 million of new, unsecured 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes. Additionally, we repurchased approximately $106 million in treasury stock in fiscal year 2003. Cash generated from operations for fiscal year 2003 was $1.309 billion, an increase of $58 million from the prior years cash from operations of $1.251 billion. Cash from operations was favorably impacted this fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year by savings in operating costs. As of March 31, 2003 and 2002, our debt arrangements consisted of the following: 2003 2002 Maximum Outstanding Maximum Outstanding Debt Arrangements Available Balance Available Balance (in millions) 1999 Revolver $400 $350 $1,000 $600 1999 Term Loan 600 2002 Revolver 440 Commercial Paper 400 1,000 82 6.770% Senior Notes due April 2003 64 128 6.250% Senior Notes due April 2003 412 575 6.375% Senior Notes due April 2005 825 825 5.000% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2007 660 660 6.500% Senior Notes due April 2008 350 350 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009 460 International line of credit 3 51 15 Other 5 7 Total $3,126 $3,842 20 Back to Index 2002 Revolver On December 31, 2002, we entered into a new, unsecured, bank revolving credit facility (the 2002 Revolver) of $400 million. During the quarter ending March 31, 2003, the 2002 Revolver was increased to $440 million, and then in April 2003 it was further increased to a total capacity of $460 million. The 2002 Revolver expires January 31, 2005, and no amount was drawn as of March 31, 2003. The interest rates on the 2002 Revolver are determined based on a ratings grid, which applies a margin to the prevailing London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). We capitalized the initial transaction fees associated with the 2002 Revolver, which totaled approximately $6 million. We are amortizing these fees over the term of the 2002 Revolver in the "Interest expense, net" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 1999 Revolver and 1999 Term Loan Effective December 31, 2002, the amount that may be outstanding at any time under the existing $1 billion, four year revolving credit facility (the 1999 Revolver), which expires on May 30, 2003, was reduced to $400 million. As of March 31, 2003, $350 million was drawn under the 1999 Revolver. The $600 million outstanding balance as of March 31, 2002, on the then existing $2 billion four year term loan (the 1999 Term Loan), was repaid in full during fiscal year 2003. On December 31, 2002 we repaid $257 million of the balance of the 1999 Term Loan in advance of the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 due date. The interest rates on the 1999 Revolver and the 1999 Term Loan are determined based on a ratings grid, which applies a margin to the prevailing LIBOR. We do not intend to renew the 1999 Revolver upon its expiration based upon our current view that the new, unsecured 2002 Revolver of $460 million, which was undrawn as of March 31, 2003, should be sufficient to meet future needs. Commercial Paper During fiscal year 2003, we reduced our commercial paper (CP) program from $1 billion to $400 million. As of March 31, 2003, there were no borrowings outstanding under the CP program. We expect any future outstanding borrowings under the CP program will be supported by cash and marketable securities on hand and undrawn amounts available under the 2002 Revolver. 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes We also utilize other financial markets in order to maintain our broad sources of liquidity. In fiscal year 2003, we issued $460 million of unsecured 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes (1.625% Notes), due December 15, 2009, in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933 (Rule 144A). The 1.625% Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with all existing senior unsecured indebtedness. Concurrent with the issuance of the 1.625% Notes, we also entered into call spread repurchase option transactions (1.625% Notes Call Spread). The entire 1.625% Notes Call Spread purchase price of $73 million was charged to Stockholders Equity. Under the terms of the 1.625% Notes Call Spread, we have the option to receive (i) outstanding shares equivalent to the number of shares that may be issued if all of the 1.625% Notes are converted into shares (22.954 million shares) upon payment of an exercise price of $20.04 per share (aggregate of $460 million); or (ii) a net cash settlement, net share settlement or a combination, whereby we will receive cash or shares equal to the increase in the market value of the 22.954 million shares from the aggregate value at the $20.04 exercise price (aggregate of $460 million), subject to the upper limit of $30.00 discussed below. The 1.625% Notes Call Spread is designed to partially mitigate the potential dilution from conversion of the 1.625% Notes, depending upon the market price of our common stock at such time. The 1.625% Notes Call Spread can be exercised during December 2009 at an exercise price of $20.04 per share. To limit the cost of the 1.625% Notes Call Spread, an upper limit of $30.00 per share has been set such that if the price of the common stock is above that limit at the time of exercise, the number of shares eligible to be purchased will be proportionately reduced based on the amount the common share price exceeds $30.00 at the time of exercise. We capitalized the initial transaction fees associated with the 1.625% Notes, which totaled approximately $12 million. These fees are being amortized over the period through maturity of the 1.625% Notes in the "Interest expense, net" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 5% Convertible Senior Notes In fiscal year 2002, we issued $660 million of unsecured 5% Convertible Senior Notes (5% Notes), due March 15, 2007, in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A. The 5% Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with all existing senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company capitalized the initial transaction fees associated with the 5% Notes, which totaled approximately $16 million. These fees are being amortized over the period through maturity of the 5% Notes in the "Interest expense, net" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Concurrent with the issuance of the 5% Notes, we entered into call spread repurchase option transactions (5% Notes Call Spread). The option purchase price of the 5% Notes Call Spread was $95 million. The entire purchase price of $95 million was charged to Stockholders Equity. Under the terms of the 5% Notes Call Spread, we have the option to purchase outstanding shares equivalent to the number of shares that may be issued if all the 5% Notes are converted into shares (27.116 million shares), thereby mitigating dilution to stockholders. The 5% Notes Call Spreads are designed to partially mitigate the potential dilution from conversion of the 5% Notes, depending upon the market price of our common stock at such time. The 5% Notes Call Spread can be exercised at the three year anniversary of the issuance of the 5% Notes at an exercise price of $24.83 per share. To limit the cost of the 5% Notes Call Spread, an upper limit of $36.60 per share has been set such that if the price of the common stock is above that limit at the time of exercise, the number of shares eligible to be purchased will be proportionately reduced based on the amount the common share price exceeds $36.60 at the time of exercise. 21 Back to Index Fiscal Year 1999 Senior Notes In fiscal year 1999, we issued $1.750 billion of unsecured Senior Notes in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A. Amounts borrowed, rates, and maturities for each issue were $575 million at 6.25% due April 15, 2003, $825 million at 6.375% due April 15, 2005, and $350 million at 6.5% due April 15, 2008. During fiscal year 2003, we repurchased $163 million of the 6.25% Senior Notes due April 15, 2003 at a discount. The repurchases resulted in a total gain of approximately $3 million. The gain was included in the "Interest expense, net" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of March 31, 2003, $412 million, $825 million and $350 million of our 6.25%, 6.375% and 6.5% Senior Notes, respectively, remained outstanding. The balance of the 6.25% Senior Notes was fully repaid in April 2003. Fiscal Year 1997 Senior Notes In fiscal year 1997, $320 million of unsecured 6.77% Senior Notes were issued in a private transaction pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The 6.77% Senior Notes call for annual repayment of $64 million each April, commencing in April 1999 with final payment in April 2003. As of March 31, 2003, $64 million was outstanding under the 6.77% Senior Notes. The balance of the 6.77% Senior Notes was fully repaid in April 2003. International Line of Credit An unsecured and uncommitted multi currency line of credit is available to meet short term working capital needs for subsidiaries operating outside the United States. This line totals $3 million, and no amount was drawn under this credit line as of March 31, 2003. Other Matters We pre fund contributions to our broad based, employee defined contribution retirement plan annually each March. Pre funded contributions totaled $45 million and $17 million for the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Subsequent to March 31, 2003, we received $17 million in proceeds related to the sale of fixed assets. Since the carrying value of the fixed assets was zero, the entire amount will result in a gain to be recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2003. Debt ratings for our senior unsecured notes and our bank credit facilities are BBB+ and Baa2 from Standard & Poors and Moodys Investors Service, respectively. Our CP program is rated A 2 from Standard & Poors and P 2 from Moodys. Peak borrowings under all debt facilities during the fiscal year 2003 totaled approximately $3.842 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.39%. As of March 31, 2003, the cumulative number of shares purchased under our various open market common stock repurchase programs since fiscal year 1991 was 178 million, including 8 million shares purchased in fiscal year 2003. The remaining number of shares authorized for repurchase is approximately 22 million. Capital resource requirements as of March 31, 2003 consisted of lease obligations for office space, equipment, mortgage or loan obligations, and amounts due as a result of product and company acquisitions. It is expected that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines, and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. We expect our long standing history of providing extended payment terms to our customers to continue. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have commitments to invest approximately $5 million in connection with joint venture agreements. In prior fiscal years, we sold individual accounts receivable under the prior business model to an external third party subject to certain recourse provisions. The amounts subject to recourse approximated $141 million and $218 million as of March 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other than the commitments and indemnification described above, we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and, accordingly, off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited. 22 Back to Index Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with current accounting rules, the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at March 31, 2003, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. In addition, the table summarizes the timing of principal payments on noncurrent debt as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2003. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 After Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (in millions) Noncurrent debt (inclusive of interest) Noncurrent operating leases(1) Noncurrent purchase obligations Total $3,536 746 101 $4,383 $ 949 164 44 $1,157 $1,009 260 23 $1,292 $754 189 11 $954 $824 133 23 $980 (1) The contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases include sublease income totaling $116 million, expected to be received in the following periods: $27 million (less than 1 year); $38 million (1 3 years); $27 million (3 5 years); and $24 million (after 5 years). As of March 31, 2003, we have no material capital lease obligations, either individually or in the aggregate. Critical Accounting Policies and Business Practices Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. The following items are the critical accounting policies and business practices that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. Basis of Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources: (1) licensing software products, (2) providing customer technical support (hereafter referred to as maintenance), and (3) providing professional services, such as consulting and education. We recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Position 97 2 "Software Revenue Recognition," (SOP 97 2) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants as amended by SOP 98 9 "Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions." While these statements substantially govern the basis for software licensing revenue recognition, we believe that we exercise appropriate judgment in applying criteria set forth in these SOPs to record deferred subscription revenue and to recognize revenue. In accordance with SOP 97 2, we recognize revenue from the licensing of our software products when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a legally binding agreement with a customer; (2) we deliver the products; (3) license agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final; and (4) collection is probable. The Company recognizes revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the term of the license. Our software licenses generally do not include acceptance provisions. An acceptance provision generally allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before they commit to licensing the software. If a license agreement includes an acceptance provision, we do not record deferred subscription revenue or recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or, if not notified by the customer to cancel the license agreement, the expiration of the acceptance period. Beginning in October 2000, we began executing software license agreements that include flexible contractual provisions that, among other things, allow customers to receive unspecified future software products for no additional fee. These agreements combine the right to use the software product with maintenance for the term of the agreement. Under these agreements, we are required to recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the license agreement beginning upon completion of the four SOP 97 2 recognition criteria noted above. For license agreements signed prior to October 2000, once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met, software license fees were recognized as revenue up front and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license. 23 Back to Index Maintenance revenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) combined license and maintenance agreements recorded under our prior business model and (2) standalone maintenance agreements recorded under both our prior business model and our current Business Model. Under our prior business model, maintenance and license fees were generally combined into a single license agreement. The maintenance portion was deferred and is amortized into revenue over the initial license agreement term. Many of these license agreements have not reached the end of their initial terms and, therefore, continue to amortize. This amortization is recorded to the "Maintenance" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The deferred maintenance portion, which was generally optional to the customer, was determined using its fair value based on annual, fixed maintenance renewal rates stated in the agreement. Since we no longer record license agreements under our prior business model, the amount of maintenance deferred as well as the amount of maintenance revenue recognized from such agreements will continue to decrease. For license agreements entered into under our current Business Model, maintenance and license fees continue to be combined; however, the maintenance is no longer optional on an annual basis but rather is inclusive for the entire term. We recognize such combined fees on the "Subscription revenue" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under both our prior business model and our current Business Model, we record standalone maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance for their non term based license agreements. Maintenance revenue from such renewals is recognized over the term of the renewal agreement. We have experienced renewal rates of approximately 80% for fiscal years 2003 and 2002. Revenue recognition from professional service arrangements begins when all four of the SOP 97 2 revenue recognition criteria as discussed above are met and as the services are performed. If it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed. Revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and VARs is generally recognized when all four of the SOP 97 2 revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software products to their customers. This is commonly referred to as the sell through method. We have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and have a history of successfully collecting primarily all amounts due under such agreements. We assess collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed, which is generally upon receipt of cash. Our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products. Such warranties are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. Under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements, we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on, among other things, allegations that our software product infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. In most cases, in the event of an infringement claim, we retain the right to (i) procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product; (ii) replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be reasonably achieved, we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid. Such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. The indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer. Accounts Receivable As detailed in the table included in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2003, net trade and installment accounts receivable, after accounting for unearned revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts, were $2.373 billion. The allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for potential impairment of accounts receivable on the balance sheet. It reflects an accounting estimate of unidentified losses in the accounts receivable portfolio resulting from the expectations of not collecting all of these accounts receivable in full. The valuation allowance relates to two components of receivables: (a) specifically identified receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment; and (b) all other receivables. A specific receivable is reviewed for impairment when, based on current information and events, we do not expect to collect fully amounts due according to the contractual terms of the receivable agreement. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring, and filing for bankruptcy. A specific allowance is provided based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated amounts to be collected. 24 Back to Index We review the adequacy of the general allowance for doubtful accounts attributable to the remaining pool of accounts receivable by performing various analytical procedures and considering our history of collections of long term software agreements, as well as the overall economic environment. A 10% change in the estimated default rate used to calculate the general allowance for doubtful accounts would have an approximate $8 million effect on the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2003. We expect the allowance for doubtful accounts to continue to decline as net installment accounts receivable under the prior business model are billed and collected. Under our Business Model, amounts due from customers are offset by deferred subscription revenue (unearned revenue) related to these amounts, resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet. Therefore, less of an allowance for doubtful accounts is required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable, net of unearned revenue, for the past two fiscal years has approximated 10.5%. Deferred Tax Assets When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." This process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction, estimate differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement purposes versus tax return purposes (known as "temporary differences"), which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We have recognized as a deferred tax asset, a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations, which are expected to result in a future tax benefit. As of March 31, 2003, the current and noncurrent deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance, totaled $78 million and $29 million, respectively, and have been offset against the respective deferred tax liabilities. This recognition assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that the carryforward of these losses will be realized. The factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are primarily a result of acquisition expenses, such as duplicate facility costs, employee severance and other costs, foreign net operating losses (NOLs), and the recognition of subscription revenue pursuant to our Business Model. The NOLs generally expire between 2004 and 2014. An additional valuation allowance of $17 million was established in fiscal year 2003 for certain foreign deferred tax assets we believe might not be realized. Future results may vary from these estimates. At this time it is not practicable to determine if we will need to increase the valuation allowance or if such future valuations will have a material impact on our financial statements. Goodwill, Capitalized Software Products, and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill under SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." This statement requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill. As a result of various acquisitions completed under the purchase method, goodwill constitutes a significant portion of our total assets. The SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model is a two step process. The first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions. These estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management. This approach uses significant assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, and a terminal growth rate. 25 Back to Index During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, we performed our annual impairment review and recorded a non cash charge of $80 million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with our professional services organization to its fair value as of March 31, 2003. This charge resulted from the weak spending environment that affected the IT service sector in general, as well as our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products. The impairment charge was recorded to the "Goodwill impairment" line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The carrying value of capitalized software products, both purchased software and internally developed software, and other intangible assets, are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of internal and external facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. Such facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of cost for other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date. It is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or, if such an impairment were to occur, the magnitude thereof. New Accounting Pronouncements In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 requires, among other things, that entities record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. This pronouncement is effective for us beginning April 1, 2003. This pronouncement will not have a material impact on the Company upon adoption. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145, among other things, rescinds SFAS No. 4, which required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item, and amends SFAS No. 13 to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions. We adopted SFAS No. 145 effective July 1, 2002. As a result, we recorded a $3 million gain in fiscal year 2003 from the early retirement of a portion of our debt which was included in the "Interest expense, net" line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. SFAS No. 146 also established that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We have not entered into any significant exit or disposal activities since the effective date of this statement. As such, SFAS No. 146 has not had an impact on the Company. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." Interpretation No. 45 requires a guarantor to include disclosure of certain obligations, and if applicable, at the inception of the guarantee, recognize a liability for the fair value of other certain obligations undertaken in issuing a guarantee. The recognition requirement was effective for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We adopted Interpretation No. 45 effective December 2002 and the applicable disclosures have been made. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables." Issue 00 21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and or rights to use assets. The provisions of Issue 00 21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal year periods beginning after June 15, 2003 that are not within the scope of higher level accounting literature, including SOP 97 2. We do not believe that the adoption of Issue 00 21 will have a material impact on the Company. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure." SFAS No. 148 amends certain provisions of SFAS No. 123 and is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. Beginning in fiscal year 2004, we will adopt the fair value based method of recording stock options outlined in SFAS No. 123. Under the fair value based method, we will charge to expense the computed value of all newly granted stock options over the vesting period based on the options fair value at the date of grant. 26 Back to Index In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." Interpretation No. 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 and applies immediately to any variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest entities in which an interest is obtained after that date. This Interpretation is applicable for us in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, which ends September 30, 2003, for interests acquired in variable interest entities prior to February 1, 2003. This Interpretation requires variable interest entities to be consolidated if the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit an entity to finance its activities without support from other parties or the equity investors lack certain, specified characteristics. The adoption of this Interpretation for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 did not have a material impact on the Company. We are continuing to review the provisions of this Interpretation to determine its impact, if any, on future reporting periods with respect to interests in variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003, but we do not currently anticipate any material accounting or disclosure requirements under the provisions of this Interpretation. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of SFAS No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. In particular, this Statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative. It also clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and is not expected to have an impact on the Company upon adoption. Risk Factors Current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, or others, many of which are beyond our control, could negatively affect our revenue, profitability, and cash flow in the future. Operating results and revenue are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors. Quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a number of factors, including those listed below, which in turn could adversely affect our revenue, profitability, and cash flow in the future. Demand for products and services; Length of sales cycle; Customer implementation of our products; Magnitude of price and product competition; Introduction of new hardware; General economic conditions in countries in which customers do a substantial amount of business; Customer budgets for hardware and software; Ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced versions of our products; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates; Ability to control costs; The size of licensing transactions; Reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces; Settlement of litigation; Ability to retain and attract qualified personnel; and Reaction of customers to our Business Model. Any of the foregoing factors, among others, may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high or cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate. As a consequence, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow could be adversely affected. The success of our international operations is subject to many factors. International revenue has historically represented approximately 40% of our total worldwide revenue. Continued success in selling our products outside of the United States will depend on a variety of factors, including: Reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces; Fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates; Staffing key managerial positions; General economic conditions in foreign countries; Political instability; and Trade restrictions such as tariffs, duties, or other controls affecting foreign operations. Increase in tariffs, the imposition of trade restrictions, or other factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. 27 Back to Index Our products must remain compatible with ever changing operating environments. IBM, HP, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft are the largest suppliers of systems and computing software and, in most cases, are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers. Historically, these operating system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems, systems software, and computer hardware. Such new products could in the future incorporate features that perform functions currently performed by our products or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software. Although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and system software developers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. The computer software business is highly competitive. The market in which we compete is marked by rapid and substantial technological change, the steady emergence of new companies and products, evolving industry standards, and changing customer needs. We compete with many established companies in the markets we serve, and some of these companies may have substantially greater financial, marketing and technological resources, larger distribution capabilities, earlier access to customers, and greater opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than us. We also compete with many smaller, less established companies that may be able to focus more effectively on specific product segments or markets. Historically, we have competed primarily on the basis of our products features and performance. As product pricing becomes a more important criterion for our customers, we may experience increased competition from certain, low price competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and continue to enhance existing products. We may be unsuccessful in our ability to develop new releases or new products that meet the needs of our customers in light of competitive alternatives available in the market. In addition, the introduction of new products or versions of existing products may not meet with customer acceptance or may be delayed. Our inability to bring new products and enhancements to existing products to the market in a timely manner or the failure for these products to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Certain software is licensed from third parties. Some of our products contain software licensed from third parties. Some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or enhancement of existing products. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights would weaken our competitive position. Our future success is dependent upon our proprietary technology. We protect our proprietary information through the use of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, policing unauthorized use or copying of our proprietary information is difficult. Unauthorized use or copying occurs from time to time and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and diversion of resources. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not afford the same degree of protection to our proprietary rights as do the laws of the United States. For example, "shrink wrap" or "click on" licenses may be unenforceable in whole or in part in some jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, patents we have obtained may be circumvented, challenged, invalidated, or designed around by other companies. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property for these or other reasons could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Customers are still adapting to our Business Model. Our Business Model affords customers greater flexibility in licensing transactions. For example, under the Business Model, we offer software licenses on a month to month or other short term basis in order to allow customers the opportunity to try our software products without committing to a multi year license obligation. Transactions such as these increase the risk that customers will not fully implement our software and will not enter into a long term relationship with us. This effect could be diminished if customers elect cost certainty by committing to longer license agreement periods. Additionally, customer preference for payment (upfront, annual or monthly installments) could impact the amount of cash generated from operations in any period. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. 28 Back to Index Changes to compensation of our sales organization. We update our compensation plan for the sales organization annually. These plans are intended to align with our Business Model objectives of providing customer flexibility and satisfaction. The compensation plan may encourage behavior not anticipated or intended as it is implemented, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. We have a significant amount of debt. As of March 31, 2003, we had approximately $3.1 billion of debt outstanding, which consists of bank credit lines, unsecured fixed rate senior note obligations, convertible senior notes, and unsecured multi currency credit facilities. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, expected cash provided from operations, and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. Failure to generate sufficient cash as the debt becomes due or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. We may become dependent upon large transactions. We have historically been dependent upon large dollar enterprise transactions with individual customers. As a result of the flexibility afforded by our Business Model, we anticipate that there will be fewer of these transactions in the future. There can be no assurances, however, that we will not be reliant on large dollar enterprise transactions in the future, and the failure to close such transactions could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, operating results, and cash flow. Growth depends upon successful integration of acquisitions. Our growth strategy is based upon internal development of technology, selective acquisitions, and integration of such acquisitions into ongoing operations. Implementation of this growth strategy may result in strains on our management team, internal systems, and financial resources. Difficulties encountered in successfully integrating acquired companies and products may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. We could be subject to fines, penalties, or other sanctions as a result of a joint inquiry by the SEC and U.S. Attorneys Office. As previously reported, we have been cooperating with an ongoing joint inquiry being conducted by the staff of the Northeast Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York concerning certain of our accounting practices. See Item 3. "Legal Proceedings." Although we are unable at this point to predict the scope or outcome of this inquiry, it is possible that it could result in the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, suspensions or disbarments from government contracts, and or other remedies and sanctions. The conduct of these proceedings could negatively impact our stock price. In addition, we expect to continue to incur expenses associated with responding to these agencies, regardless of the outcome, and this may divert the efforts and attention of our management team from normal business operations. Our credit ratings could be downgraded. In March 2002, Moodys Investors Service downgraded our senior unsecured long term debt rating and shifted its rating outlook on us from stable to negative. In addition, in February 2002 Standard & Poors revised its rating outlook on us from stable to negative. We cannot assure investors that Moodys, Standard & Poors, or any other rating agency will not further downgrade our credit ratings in the future. If our credit ratings are downgraded, we could be required to, among other things, pay additional interest under our credit agreements or other debt. Any such downgrades could also affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and will affect the terms of any such financing. Customer decisions are influenced by general economic conditions. Our products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of our customers information processing resources. In a recessionary environment, our products are often a reasonable economic alternative for customers faced with the prospect of incurring expenditures to increase their existing information processing resources. However, a general slowdown in the world economy or a particular region could cause customers to delay or forgo decisions to license new products or upgrades to their existing environments and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. 29 Back to Index The software business is marked by easy entry and large, entrenched businesses. Many companies with whom we compete, including IBM, Sun Microsystems, HP, and other large computer manufacturers, have substantial resources, a larger installed base of customers in any particular market niche, as well as the ability to develop and market software programs similar to and competitive with the products offered by us. Additionally, these producers can bundle hardware, software, and services together, which is a disadvantage for us since we cannot install hardware and have far fewer services offerings. Competitive products are also offered by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry. Some, like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP, are the leading developers and vendors in their specialized markets. In addition, new companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis, offering products that compete with those offered by us. Increased competition also results from consolidation of existing companies within the industry. Additionally, many customers historically have developed their own products that compete with those offered by us. Competition from any of these sources can result in price reductions, or displacement of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Future product development is dependent upon access to third party operating systems. In the past, licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with "source code," which makes the operating system generally understandable to programmers, and "object code," which directly controls the hardware and other technical documentation. Since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software, which must interface with the operating systems, independent software vendors such as us were able to develop and market compatible software. Microsoft, IBM, and other vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems. To date, this policy has not had a material effect on us. Some companies, however, may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access. These restrictions may, in the future, result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products. Although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect, there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Third party microcode could impact product development. We anticipate ongoing use of microcode or firmware provided by hardware manufacturers. Microcode and firmware are essentially software programs in hardware form and are therefore less flexible than other types of software. We believe that such continued use will not have a significant impact on our operations and that our products will remain compatible with any changes to such code. However, there can be no assurance that future technological developments involving such microcode will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. The markets for some or all of our key product areas may not grow. We have identified six product areas: enterprise management; security; storage; portal and business intelligence; application life cycle management; and data management and application development. Some or all of these areas may not grow, may decline in growth, or customers may decline or forgo use of products in some or all of these product areas. This is particularly true in newly emerging areas, such as portal and business intelligence. A decline in these product areas could result in decreased demand for our products, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Third parties could claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement of various forms of their intellectual property. Investigation of these claims, whether with or without merit, can be expensive and could affect development, marketing, or shipment of our products. As the number of software patents issued increases, it is likely that additional claims, with or without merit, will be asserted. Defending against such claims is time consuming and could result in significant litigation expense or settlement with unfavorable terms that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in transaction losses. Most of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies. Due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, it is not possible to predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results. Given the relatively long sales cycle that is typical for many of our products, foreign currency fluctuations could result in substantial changes in the foreign currency impact on these transactions. Additionally, deterioration of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar can affect our ability to increase our revenue within those markets, all of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. 30 Back to Index Acts of terrorism or war may adversely affect our business. Acts of terrorism, acts of war, and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to our properties, business, employees, suppliers, distributors, resellers, and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Our stock price may continue to be volatile. Our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, the gain or loss of significant license agreements, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, changes in domestic and international economic and business conditions, general conditions in the software and computer industries, and other events or factors. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries that are similar or related to those in which we operate and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These market fluctuations have in the past adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Potential European Union tariffs or United States Congressional action in connection with the extraterritorial income case could adversely affect our business. The World Trade Organization (WTO) recently authorized sanctions against the United States for operating the extraterritorial income regime. This regime relates to a provision in the United States Tax Code providing tax incentives on products manufactured in the United States and exported for sale. The WTO has ruled the regime to be an illegal export subsidy and has now authorized the European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on certain United States made products imported into the EU. EU officials have indicated that they will not raise tariffs provided that the United States shows substantial progress and a commitment to act within the next year. We cannot be certain, however, what impact the potential EU tariffs could have on the software industry or the economy in general. Additionally, we cannot be certain that any legislation replacing the extraterritorial income regime will continue to provide us with the level of tax incentives received under the existing regime. We currently save approximately $12 million per year in United States federal income tax under the current extraterritorial income regime. Item 7(a). Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, debt, and installment accounts receivable. We have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers (Standard & Poors single "A" rating and higher). To mitigate risk, many of the securities have a maturity date within one year, and holdings of any one issuer, excluding the U.S. government, do not exceed 10% of the portfolio. Periodically, the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. We maintain a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments. As of March 31, 2003, our outstanding debt approximated $3.1 billion, with approximately $2.8 billion in fixed rate obligations. If market rates were to decline, we could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates. Each 25 basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $7 million. Each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an approximate $1 million annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of March 31, 2003. Under our prior business model, we offered financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our software solution sales. The aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element, which can vary with the interest rate environment. Each 25 basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $7 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in 46 countries. We are therefore exposed to movement in currency exchange rates. As part of our risk management strategy and consistent with prior years, we did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative transactions. In addition, we manage our level of exposure by denominating a majority of international sales and payments of related expense in the local currencies of our subsidiaries. A 1% change in all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would have an insignificant effect on our results from operations. 31 Back to Index Equity Price Risk As of March 31, 2003, we have minimal investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies. These investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or temporary losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity. It is not customary for us to make investments in equity securities as part of our investment strategy.
