Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Introduction This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to provide a more complete understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity, and results of operations. As described in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in fiscal year 2004 we divested a subsidiary, ACCPAC International, Inc. (ACCPAC). The assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flow of ACCPAC have been classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented prior to the sale of ACCPAC in March 2004. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations excludes the effect of the discontinued operation. Nature of Business As described in greater detail in Item 1, Business, we license our software products directly to customers as well as through distributors, resellers, and VARs. We generate revenue from the following sources: license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis; maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements; and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation, consulting, and education services. The timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a period are determined individually by license agreement, based on its duration and specific terms. Under our Business Model, we provide customers with the flexibility to license software under month to month licenses or to fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements. We also permit customers to change their software mix as their business and technology needs change, which includes the right to receive software in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee. As a result of the right our customers have to receive unspecified future upgrades, we are required under GAAP to recognize revenue from our license agreements evenly on a monthly basis (also known as ratably) over the license term. We believe recognizing license revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement improves the predictability of our revenue streams and more accurately reflects the earnings process. Under agreements entered into prior to October 2000 (the prior business model), and as is common practice in the software industry, we did not offer our customers the right to receive unspecified future upgrades. As a result, for most license agreements entered into prior to October 2000, we were required under GAAP to record the present value of the license agreement as revenue at the time the license agreement was signed. Under our Business Model, the portion of the license revenue that has not yet been recognized creates what we refer to as deferred subscription revenue. Deferred subscription revenue is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the license agreements. When recognized, this revenue is reported on the Subscription revenue line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue, the amount deferred is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Not all of our active customer contracts have been transitioned to our Business Model, which has created what we refer to as a Transition Period, during which the license agreements under our prior business model come up for renewal. During the Transition Period, we are building deferred subscription revenue, from which subscription revenue will be amortized. Total deferred subscription revenue, and the associated subscription revenue that comes out of it, is expected to increase over time as we continue to renew customer contracts that were executed under the prior business model, sell additional products and capacity to existing customers as well as enter into new contracts with new customers. We expect that the majority of contracts executed under the prior business model will be transitioned to our Business Model by the end of fiscal year 2006. While the impact of changing from an up front revenue recognition model to our Business Model initially reduced our reported revenue, we generally did not change our cost structure. Therefore, we have primarily experienced losses since we introduced our Business Model. We expect that our revenues will continue to increase at a greater rate than our expenses, and we expect to return to profitability during fiscal year 2005. Under both the prior business model and current Business Model, customers often pay for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement. We refer to these payments as installment payments. While the transition to the current Business Model has changed the timing of revenue recognition, in most cases it has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers. As a result, our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the transition to the current Business Model over the past several years. We do not expect any significant changes in our cash generated from operations as we complete this transition. 16 Table of Contents Performance Indicators Management uses several quantitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition. Each provides a measurement of the performance of our Business Model and how well we are executing our plan. Our subscription based Business Model is unique among our competitors in the software industry, and during the Transition Period it is difficult to compare our results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors. Management focuses on period over period improvement when reviewing our performance indicators. The following is a summary of some of the quantitative performance indicators that management uses to review our performance: Percent For the Year Ended March 31, 2004 2003 Change Change (dollars in millions) Subscription revenue $ 1,961 $ 1,414 $ 547 39 % Total revenue $ 3,276 $ 3,027 $ 249 8 % Subscription revenue as a percent of total revenue 60 % 47 % 13 % 28 % New deferred subscription revenue $ 2,298 $ 1,883 $ 415 22 % Weighted average license agreement duration in years 2.78 2.81 (.03 ) (1 %) Cash from continuing operations $ 1,280 $ 1,310 $ (30 ) (2 %) Loss from continuing operations $ (36 ) $ (270 ) $ 234 87 % Percent As of March 31, 2004 2003 Change Change (dollars in millions) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 1,902 $ 1,496 $ 406 27 % Total debt $ 2,300 $ 3,126 $ (826 ) (26 %) Analyses of our performance indicators, including general trends, can be found in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MDA. The performance indicators which we believe are unique to us are defined below. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue is the ratable revenue recognized in a period from amounts previously recorded as deferred subscription revenue. Subscription revenue also includes revenue earned from monthly licenses. The larger the ratio of subscription revenue to total revenue, the more predictable our revenue streams become. A change in subscription revenue is correlated with a change in deferred subscription revenue, and therefore, with a constant weighted average life, an increase in deferred subscription revenue will also increase subscription revenue. New Deferred Subscription Revenue New deferred subscription revenue represents the total undiscounted incremental value (contract value) of software licenses sold in the current period by our direct sales force. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we expect to offer more flexible license terms to our channel partners which will necessitate ratable recognition of revenue for the majority of our channel business. Ratable recognition of revenue for the channel license business will be consistent with our overall Business Model and will be reported on the Subscription revenue line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Previously, such channel license revenue was recorded on a sell through basis and was reported on the Software fees and other line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to this expected change, new deferred subscription revenue excludes the value associated with license agreements for maintenance only agreements, channel sales, and professional service arrangements. New deferred subscription revenue is what we expect to collect from our customers. This amount is recorded into subscription revenue ratably over the applicable software license term. These license agreements represent binding payment commitments from customers over periods up to three years. New deferred subscription revenue is sometimes referred to as bookings and is used by management as a gauge of the level of activity in a particular quarter. Our bookings typically increase in each consecutive quarter, with the fourth fiscal quarter being the strongest. 17 Table of Contents Weighted Average License Agreement Duration in Years The weighted average license agreement duration in years represents the sum of the duration of all software licenses executed during a fiscal year, weighted by each individual software licenses contract value. The annual weighted average duration of 2.78 and 2.81 years for the fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively, were derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts and weighted average durations in years, respectively: Fiscal Year 2004 Fiscal Year 2003 Weighted Weighted New Deferred Average New Deferred Average Subscription Duration Subscription Duration Revenue in Years Revenue in Years (dollars in millions) Fourth Quarter $ 836 2.70 $ 629 2.85 Third Quarter 670 2.90 538 2.80 Second Quarter 405 2.70 394 2.80 First Quarter 387 2.85 322 2.75 $ 2,298 2.78 $ 1,883 2.81 We believe license agreement durations averaging approximately three years, which is lower than the historical duration of our license agreements, increase the value customers receive from our software licenses by giving customers the flexibility to vary their software mix as their needs change. We also believe this flexibility improves our customer relationships and encourages greater accountability by the Company to each of our customers. Results of Operations Revenue The following table presents the percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the revenue line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2004 Fiscal Year 2003 Percentage Percentage Percentage of of Percentage of of Total Dollar Total Dollar Revenue Change Revenue Change 2004/ 2003/ 2004 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 Revenue: Subscription revenue 60 % 47 % 39 % 47 % 29 % 71 % Software fees and other 9 % 11 % (12 %) 11 % 13 % (10 %) Maintenance 18 % 24 % (19 %) 24 % 32 % (21 %) Financing fees 6 % 10 % (37 %) 10 % 15 % (35 %) Professional services 7 % 8 % (6 %) 8 % 11 % (18 %) Total revenue 100 % 100 % 8 % 100 % 100 % 5 % Total Revenue Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased $249 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, to $3.276 billion. This increase in total revenue was primarily due to the transition to our Business Model that began during the third quarter of fiscal year 2001. This transition resulted in an increase in subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year, partially offset by an anticipated decrease in maintenance and financing fees as described below. Professional services and software fees and other revenue decreased $55 million for fiscal year 2004 as described below. In addition, in fiscal year 2004, there was a positive impact to revenue of $173 million compared to fiscal year 2003 due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily associated with the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. Continued cautious capital spending by our existing and potential customers impacted bookings of new license agreements and revenue in fiscal year 2004. Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 increased $141 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, to $3.027 billion. This increase in total revenue was primarily due to the transition to our Business Model. Professional services and software fees and other revenue decreased $94 million for fiscal year 2003 as described below. 18 Table of Contents In addition, in fiscal year 2003, there was a positive impact to revenue of $81 million compared to fiscal year 2002 due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. This foreign exchange rate impact was fully offset by the impact of the sale of our interBiz unit in April 2002, which had contributed approximately $82 million of revenue in fiscal year 2002. Cautious capital spending by our existing and potential customers associated with weak conditions in the overall economy and the IT industry adversely impacted bookings of new license agreements and revenue in fiscal year 2003. Although the transition to our Business Model and weaker economic conditions impacted revenue, quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on such decrease is not determinable. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased $547 million from fiscal year 2003, to $1.961 billion. Subscription revenue represents the portion of revenue ratably recognized on software license agreements entered into under our Business Model. Many of the licenses recorded between October 2000, when our Business Model was implemented, and the end of fiscal year 2003 continued to contribute to subscription revenue on a monthly, ratable basis. As a result, subscription revenue for fiscal year 2004 includes the ratable recognition of bookings recorded in fiscal year 2004, as well as bookings recorded between October 2000 and the end of fiscal year 2003. This is the primary reason for the increase in subscription revenue in fiscal year 2004 versus fiscal year 2003. During fiscal years 2004 and 2003, we added new bookings, or new deferred subscription revenue, of $2.298 billion and $1.883 billion, respectively. The weighted average life of license agreements executed under our Business Model was approximately 2.8 years for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2004 and 2003. Thus, annualized deferred subscription revenue, which represents the total value of all new software license agreements signed during a period divided by the weighted average life of all such license agreements recorded during the same period, increased approximately $156 million, or 23%, for fiscal year 2004 over the prior fiscal year to $826 million. Subscription revenue also increased as a result of how we record maintenance revenue under our Business Model. Under the prior business model, maintenance revenue was separately identified and was reported on the Maintenance line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under the Business Model, maintenance bundled with product sales is not separately identified in our customers license agreements and therefore is included within the Subscription revenue line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the increase in subscription revenue is not determinable. Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003 increased $587 million from the prior fiscal year to $1.414 billion. Similar to the increase in fiscal year 2004, the increase was primarily due to our transition to our Business Model that began in the third quarter of fiscal year 2001. Fiscal year 2003 included subscription revenue earned from software license agreements that renewed during fiscal year 2003. These license agreements did not contribute to revenue in fiscal year 2002. During fiscal years 2003 and 2002, we added new deferred subscription revenue of $1.883 billion and $2.178 billion, respectively. Software Fees and Other Software fees and other revenue primarily consists of revenue and royalties related to distribution and OEM partners. Revenue related to distribution partners and OEMs is sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, software fees and other revenue decreased $41 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, to $308 million. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the amount of channel sales recognized as maintenance (which is deferred) of approximately $53 million over the prior fiscal year period. This deferred maintenance will be amortized into revenue over time. The decrease in software fees and other was partially offset by an increase in the amount of indirect license revenue recorded in fiscal year 2004 as compared with fiscal year 2003. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, software fees and other decreased $39 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, to $349 million. The decrease was primarily due to a difficult economic and competitive environment. Maintenance As expected, maintenance revenue for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 decreased $137 million and $198 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $589 million and $726 million, respectively. The decrease in maintenance revenue for both years is attributable to additional license agreements signed under our Business Model, where bundled maintenance revenue is included with license revenue, which is reported in the Subscription revenue line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The combined maintenance and license revenue on these types of license agreements is recognized on a monthly basis ratably over the term of the agreement. The decrease is partially offset by new maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance at the expiration of their non term based license agreements. The quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the decrease in maintenance revenue is not determinable. Financing Fees Financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under the prior business model, which required up front revenue recognition. This discount initially reduced the related 19 Table of Contents installment accounts receivable and was referred to as unamortized discounts. The related unamortized discount is amortized over the life of the applicable license agreement and reported as financing fees. Under our Business Model, additional unamortized discounts are no longer recorded, since we no longer recognize revenue on an up front basis for sales of products with extended payment terms. As expected, for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, financing fees decreased $106 million and $154 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $184 million and $290 million, respectively. The decrease for both years is attributable to the discontinuance of offering license agreements under the prior business model and is expected to decline to zero over the next several years. Professional Services Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2004 decreased $14 million from fiscal year 2003 to $234 million. The decrease was a result of the weak spending environment that affected the IT service sector in general, as well as our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products. Our professional services headcount was reduced by approximately 250 as a result of the creation of our CA Technology Services group in April 2003. Quantification of the impact that these factors had on the decrease in professional services revenue is not determinable. Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2003 decreased $55 million from fiscal year 2002 to $248 million. The decrease was partially attributable to the divestiture of our interBiz unit in April 2002, which generated approximately $20 million of professional services revenue in fiscal year 2002. The decrease was also a result of the weak spending environment that affected the IT service sector in general, as well as our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products. Quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the decrease in professional services revenue is not determinable. Total Revenue by Geography Fiscal Year 2004 Fiscal Year 2003 (dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Change 2003 2002 Change United States $ 1,716 $ 1,725 (1 %) $ 1,725 $ 1,769 (2 %) International 1,560 1,302 20 % 1,302 1,117 17 % $ 3,276 $ 3,027 8 % $ 3,027 $ 2,886 5 % International revenue increased $258 million, or 20%, in fiscal year 2004 as compared with fiscal year 2003. The increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to a positive impact to revenue from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $173 million for fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003, which was primarily caused by the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. The increase was also a result of increased contract bookings in prior periods associated with our European business. Despite an increase in fiscal year 2004 of combined subscription, maintenance, and financing revenue in the United States of approximately $59 million, compared to fiscal year 2003, total revenue in the United States declined slightly primarily due to a decrease in professional services revenue and software fees and other, for the reasons described above. International revenue increased $185 million, or 17%, in fiscal year 2003 as compared with fiscal year 2002. Results in fiscal year 2002 included our interBiz operations, which we divested in April 2002. Those operations contributed approximately $50 million and $32 million of revenue in fiscal year 2002 from the United States and international regions, respectively. The increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to an improvement in our business in Europe and Asia as well as the $81 million positive impact due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Despite an increase in fiscal year 2003 of combined subscription, maintenance, and financing revenue in the United States of $72 million, compared to fiscal year 2002, total revenue in the United States declined slightly primarily due to a decrease in professional services revenue and software fees and other, for the reasons described above. Price changes and inflation did not have a material impact in fiscal years 2004, 2003, or 2002. 20 Table of Contents Expenses The following table presents expenses as a percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the expense line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2004 Fiscal Year 2003 Percentage Percentage Percentage of of Percentage of of Total Dollar Total Dollar Revenue Change Revenue Change 2004/ 2003/ 2004 2003 2003 2003 2002 2002 Operating expenses: Amortization of capitalized software costs 14 % 15 % 15 % 17 % (3 %) Cost of professional services 7 % 8 % (7 %) 8 % 10 % (16 %) Selling, general, and administrative 38 % 44 % (6 %) 44 % 58 % (21 %) Product development and enhancements 20 % 21 % 3 % 21 % 23 % (2 %) Commission and royalties 8 % 8 % 9 % 8 % 9 % (9 %) Depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 4 % 5 % (4 %) 5 % 21 % (77 %) Goodwill impairment 3 % (100 %) 3 % 1 % 158 % Other gains/expenses, net 2 % 3 % (45 %) 3 % 1 % 169 % Shareholder litigation settlement and investigation charge 5 % NA Total operating expenses 98 % 107 % (0 %) 107 % 140 % (20 %) Interest expense, net 4 % 6 % (31 %) 6 % 8 % (26 %) Note Amounts may not add to their respective totals due to rounding. Cost of Professional Services Cost of professional services consists primarily of the personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2004 decreased $17 million from fiscal year 2003 to $220 million. This decrease was due primarily to the reduction in professional services engagements as well as a reduction in personnel costs resulting from efficiencies associated with the combination of our pre sales and post sales professional services organizations in fiscal year 2004. Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2003 decreased $46 million from fiscal year 2002 to $237 million. This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in professional service engagements and related personnel costs. Selling, General, and Administrative (SGA) SGA expenses for fiscal year 2004 decreased $75 million from fiscal year 2003 to $1.247 billion. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the provision of doubtful accounts of $121 million. This decrease is a result of how we account for contractual commitments under the Business Model. Amounts due from customers are offset by related deferred subscription revenue, resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet. In addition, under the Business Model, customer payments are often received prior to revenue recognition. Each of these items reduces the need to provide for estimated bad debts. The decrease in SGA was partially offset by a $15 million expense for severance and other termination benefits in connection with the reorganization of the U.S. channel sales organization and the creation of CA Technology Services in April 2003, as well as other increases in personnel and related costs. In addition, we incurred legal and other professional service expenses associated with the investigations being conducted by the Audit Committee, the SEC, and the U.S. Attorneys Office of approximately $30 million, which represents an increase of approximately $24 million from the prior fiscal year. Effective April 1, 2003, we began charging to expense the computed value of all newly granted stock based compensation over the vesting period. The computed fair value at the date of grant is calculated using the fair value based methodology under SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. The total stock based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year 2004 was approximately $9 million. See Note 1, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation for additional information. 21 Table of Contents SGA expenses for fiscal year 2003 decreased $353 million compared to fiscal year 2002 to $1.322 billion. The decrease was attributable to our emphasis on cost control measures, including a reduction in personnel and personnel related costs. During fiscal year 2003, we had an average of approximately 16,000 employees, which represented a decrease of approximately 1,500 employees from the fiscal year 2002 average of 17,500 employees. A portion of the personnel costs associated with the decrease in employees impacted other line items. The reduction in headcount consisted of a reduction in workforce of approximately 900 employees in October 2001, approximately 725 employees from the divestiture of certain assets of our interBiz operations in April 2002, and approximately 80 employees from the divestiture of our banking product group in October 2002. This reduction was partially offset by headcount additions in fiscal year 2003 primarily due to the opening of a new call center for telemarketing efforts. Our interBiz unit contributed approximately $81 million of SGA expenses in fiscal year 2002, the majority of which were personnel costs. The decrease in SGA expenses was also attributable to a reduction of bad debt expense of $151 million related to ongoing operations and $14 million of bad debt expense related to interBiz. This reduction reflects a decrease in installment accounts receivable related to the prior business model. Product Development and Enhancements For fiscal year 2004, product development and enhancement expenditures, also referred to as research and development, increased $18 million compared to fiscal year 2003 to $662 million. Research and development expenditures were approximately 20% and 21% of total revenue in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. During fiscal year 2004, we continued to focus on and invest in product development and enhancements for emerging technologies such as wireless, Web services and on demand computing, as well as a general broadening of our enterprise product offerings. Product development and enhancement expenditures for fiscal year 2003 decreased $12 million from fiscal year 2002 to $644 million. The decrease was primarily a result of a general decrease in operating expenditures; however, we continued to invest in product development and enhancements such as emerging technologies and a general broadening of our enterprise product offerings. Commissions and Royalties Commissions and royalties for fiscal year 2004 increased $23 million from fiscal year 2003 to $267 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in new deferred subscription revenue recorded in fiscal year 2004 as compared with fiscal year 2003. The increase was partially offset by a $14 million reduction in royalties to third parties, as we continue to focus on internal product development and enhancements. Commissions and royalties for fiscal year 2003 decreased $25 million from fiscal year 2002 to $244 million. This decrease was due primarily to an $11 million reduction in royalties paid to third parties resulting from continued emphasis on internal product development and enhancements. This decrease was also due to the reduction in sales and related commission expenses associated with the divestiture of certain assets of our interBiz unit. That unit contributed approximately $9 million of such expenses in fiscal year 2002. Depreciation and Amortization of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year 2004 decreased $6 million from fiscal year 2003 to $134 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets from past acquisitions becoming fully amortized. Depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal year 2003 decreased $467 million from fiscal year 2002 to $140 million. The decrease was primarily a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in April 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, a non amortization fair value based impairment approach is used to account for goodwill and certain intangible assets (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we amortized $431 million and $13 million of goodwill and the assembled workforce intangible asset, respectively, during fiscal year 2002. Goodwill Impairment During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, we performed our annual goodwill impairment review under SFAS No. 142 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for additional information about our annual review process. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 we performed our annual impairment review. As a result of the review, we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $80 million related to our professional services organization. The impairment was attributable to our lower than expected results and our projected performance. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $59 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. The charge related to the sale of interBiz in April 2002. The $59 million charge consisted of a $31 million goodwill impairment charge recorded on the Goodwill impairment line item on the Consolidated Statements 22 Table of Contents of Operations and a $28 million capitalized software impairment charge recorded on the Other gains/expenses, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 23 Table of Contents Other Gains/Expenses, Net Gains and losses attributable to sales of fixed assets, certain foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and certain other infrequent events have been included in the Other gains/expenses, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The components of Other gains/expenses, net are as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) (Gains) losses attributable to sales of fixed assets $ (19 ) $ 3 $ Expenses attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 41 66 6 Expenses attributable to legal settlements 26 15 1 Payment to Ranger Governance Ltd. 10 Impairment of capitalized software 4 28 $ 52 $ 94 $ 35 Shareholder Litigation Settlement and Investigation Charge In August 2003, we announced the settlement of all outstanding litigation related to the stockholder and derivative actions. Approval of the Federal Court was granted in December 2003. Under the settlement, we agreed to issue a total of up to 5.7 million shares of common stock to the shareholders represented in the three class action lawsuits, including payment of attorneys fees. In January 2004, approximately 1.6 million settlement shares were issued along with approximately $3.3 million to the plaintiffs attorneys for attorney fees and related expenses. In March 2004, approximately 200,000 settlement shares were issued to participants and beneficiaries of the CASH Plan. The remaining 3.8 million settlement shares, less any additional administrative expenses, will be issued to class members in the stockholder class action lawsuits upon completion of the claims administration process. At the time of the distribution to the class members, if the price of our common stock is below $23.43 per share, a portion of the remaining settlement shares (currently up to 1.5 million shares) will be distributed to the class members in cash at the price of $23.43 per share. Therefore, as of March 31, 2004, our maximum cash distribution would have been approximately $35 million. We expect to issue the balance of the shares (or corresponding amounts of cash) in our second quarter of fiscal year 2005, or at such time as the claims administration process has been completed. An initial estimate for the value of the shareholder litigation settlement was established on August 22, 2003, and until all settlement shares are issued, the projected impact will be reviewed quarterly and the expense adjusted accordingly. The related liability is reflected on the Other current liabilities line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The chart below summarizes the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closing price of our common stock and the estimated value of the shareholder litigation settlement since the initial estimate was established. Shareholder NYSE Closing Litigation Settlement Stock Price Estimated Value (in millions) March 31, 2004 $ 26.86 $ 158 December 31, 2003 27.34 158 September 30, 2003 26.11 150 August 22, 2003 25.00 144 We also recorded a $10 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 associated with the pending investigation by the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the staff of the Northeast Regional Office of the SEC. The charge was based on an initial offer we made to the government in connection with recent settlement discussions associated with the investigation. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of the government investigation or the amount of any fine or penalty, which may be significant, that may be imposed. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net for fiscal year 2004 decreased $52 million as compared to fiscal year 2003 to $117 million. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in average debt outstanding, which resulted in a $46 million decrease in interest expense; a reduction in the weighted average interest rate, which resulted in a $9 million decrease in interest expense; and accelerated amortization of financing fees in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003. This decrease was partially offset by a $3 million gain related to the early retirement of a portion of outstanding debt in fiscal year 2003. 24 Table of Contents Net interest expense for fiscal year 2003 decreased $58 million as compared to fiscal year 2002 to $169 million. Of the change, $40 million was due to the decrease in average debt outstanding, $15 million was due to the decrease in the average variable interest rate, and $3 million was the result of gains from the early retirement of portions of our outstanding debt in fiscal year 2003. Operating Margins For fiscal year 2004, our pretax loss from continuing operations was $54 million as compared to a pretax loss from continuing operations of $368 million in fiscal year 2003. The decrease in pretax loss was primarily related to an increase in revenue and a decrease in bad debt expense as noted above, partially offset by the shareholder litigation settlement expense and investigation charge of $168 million recorded in fiscal year 2004. Income Tax Benefit Our effective tax benefit from continuing operations was approximately 33%, 27%, and 20% for fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Selected Quarterly Information We have amended our Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q for the quarterly periods in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004. The primary purpose of the restatement is to correct the method we used to account for subscription revenue associated with Business Model contracts that replaced existing Business Model contracts. Previously, the remaining deferred subscription revenue balance associated with the contract that was being replaced was amortized over the term of the original contract. In accordance with SOP 97 2, the correct, and revised, method amortizes the remaining deferred subscription revenue balance over the term of the new contract. The adjustments decreased revenue by $3 million, $5 million, and $7 million for the first, second and third quarters, respectively, of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and increased deferred subscription revenue by a cumulative amount of approximately $13 million. Such deferred subscription revenue will be recognized in subsequent periods. See Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 2004 Quarterly Results June 30 Sept. 30(1) Dec. 31(2) Mar. 31(3) Total (in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 786 $ 803 $ 837 $ 850 $ 3,276 Percent of annual revenue 24 % 24 % 26 % 26 % 100 % Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 8 $ (90 ) $ 17 $ 29 $ (36 ) Basic earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share $ 0.01 $ (0.16 ) $ 0.03 $ 0.05 $ (0.06 ) Diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share 0.01 (0.16 ) 0.03 0.05 (0.06 ) 2003 Quarterly Results June 30 Sept. 30 Dec. 31 Mar. 31(4) Total Revenue $ 747 $ 751 $ 754 $ 775 $ 3,027 Percent of annual revenue 25 % 25 % 25 % 25 % 100 % Loss from continuing operations $ (64 ) $ (53 ) $ (47 ) $ (106 ) $ (270 ) Basic loss from continuing operations per share $ (0.11 ) $ (0.09 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (0.18 ) $ (0.47 ) Diluted loss from continuing operations per share (0.11 ) (0.09 ) (0.08 ) (0.18 ) (0.47 ) (1) Includes an after tax charge of approximately $100 million related to Shareholder Litigation Settlement.

(3) Includes an after tax credit of approximately $28 million related to a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts (See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and an after tax charge of $10 million related to the government investigation (See Item 3 Legal Proceedings and Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). (4) Includes an after tax charge of $80 million related to an impairment of goodwill. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $1.902 billion on March 31, 2004, an increase of $406 million from the March 31, 2003 balance of $1.496 billion. Cash generated from continuing operating activities for fiscal year 2004 was $1.280 billion, a decrease of $30 million from the prior years cash from continuing operations of $1.310 billion. Cash generated from continuing operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in taxes paid of approximately $103 million and legal settlement payments of approximately $26 million. The increase in taxes paid during fiscal year 2004 was primarily the result of the timing of estimated tax payments and were made prior to the Internal Revenue Service Revenue Procedure discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 25 Table of Contents reduction in cash generated from continuing operating activities was partially offset by a reduction of approximately $49 million in interest payments. 26 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2004, we used existing cash balances and cash from operations to repay approximately $826 million in outstanding debt compared to a net debt reduction of approximately $730 million in fiscal year 2003. As of March 31, 2004 and 2003, our debt arrangements consisted of the following: 2004 2003 Debt Arrangements Maximum Outstanding Maximum Outstanding (in millions) Available Balance Available Balance 1999 Revolving Credit Facility (expired in May 2003) $ $ $ 400 $ 350 2002 Revolving Credit Facility (expires January 2005) 470 440 Commercial paper 400 400 6.770% Senior Notes due April 2003 64 6.250% Senior Notes due April 2003 412 6.375% Senior Notes due April 2005 825 825 5.000% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2007 660 660 6.500% Senior Notes due April 2008 350 350 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009 460 460 International line of credit 5 3 Other 5 5 Total $ 2,300 $ 3,126 At March 31, 2004, we had $2.3 billion in debt and $1.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our net debt position was, therefore, approximately $400 million. We expect to use existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to pay our debt balances as they mature, and, based on historical precedent, we expect to continue to generate annual cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion. We do not believe that it will be necessary for us to access the capital markets to satisfy our debt obligations. We expect to renew our 2002 Revolving Credit Facility prior to its expiration in January 2005, and we have an option to apply for renewal of the facility for an additional year. The continuing government investigations have not materially hindered our access to the capital markets, as evidenced by our successful convertible bond offerings in March 2002 and December 2002. Our future access to the capital markets, however, could be materially impacted as a result of the conclusion of the government investigation. In addition, the conclusion of the government investigation could affect our ability to renew our 2002 Revolving Credit Facility or could impact the pricing of a new revolving credit facility. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In fiscal year 2005, we expect to use cash balances in excess of debt repayments for acquisitions of strategic technology, continued investment in product development and enhancement, and to pay dividends, as approved by the Board of Directors. We repurchased approximately $56 million of common stock in fiscal year 2004 compared with $106 million in fiscal year 2003; we received approximately $57 million in proceeds resulting from the exercise of Company stock options in fiscal year 2004 compared with $31 million in fiscal year 2003; and we paid dividends of $47 million in fiscal year 2004 compared with $46 million in fiscal year 2003. Additionally, in fiscal year 2003 we purchased a call spread option for $73 million. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Other Matters In April 2003, we received $18 million in proceeds related to the sale of certain fixed assets. Since the fixed assets were fully depreciated, the entire amount was recorded as a gain in the quarter ended June 30, 2003. In October 2003, we established a software development center in Hyderabad, India (the India Technology Center) for the purpose of enhancing our development and support capabilities, and to take advantage of certain incentives made available by the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) in accordance with local law. We currently employ approximately 250 professionals and have approximately 30,000 square feet of commercially leased office space in Hyderabad. In February 2004, we entered into a definitive agreement with the GoAP to acquire more than 30 acres in an 27 Table of Contents undeveloped Software Technology Park zone outside Hyderabad, where we intend to construct a development facility. We expect to deliver during the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 a $2 million bank guarantee in favor of the GoAP to secure our title to the 30 acre site. To date, excluding employee related costs such as salaries, relocation, housing, training, and transportation, we have invested approximately $3.5 million in connection with operations of the India Technology Center, related capital equipment, and early stage planning for the development of our facility in Hyderabad. In October 2003, Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to Baa3 from Baa2 and our short term rating for commercial paper to Prime 3 from Prime 2. In March 2004, Moodys again lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to Ba1 and our short term rating for commercial paper to Not Prime. Moodys indicated that the outlook is stable. Also in October 2003, Standard Poors (SP) placed our BBB senior unsecured debt rating and our A 2 commercial paper rating on CreditWatch with negative implications. In April 2004, SP lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to BBB and our short term rating for commercial paper to A 3. As a result of the downgrades, we will pay additional facility fees of approximately $1.2 million annually under the 2002 Revolving Credit Facility and, should we choose to borrow in the future under the 2002 Revolving Credit Facility, our cost of borrowing would be higher. These, or any other future downgrades, could also affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing. In December 2003, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York approved the settlement of all outstanding litigation related to past accounting issues. Included in the settlement are both shareholder and ERISA class action suits and related derivative litigation. As part of the settlement, we agreed to issue to the shareholder classes a total of up to 5.7 million shares of our common stock, which includes payment of attorneys fees. If our share price is below $23.43 per share at the time of distribution of the settlement shares, up to approximately $52 million would be paid in cash, and the stock portion of the settlement would be reduced to no less than 3.5 million shares. In January 2004, approximately 1.6 million settlement shares were issued along with approximately $3.3 million to the plaintiffs attorneys for attorney fees and related expenses. In March 2004, approximately 200,000 settlement shares were issued to the class members in the ERISA case. The balance of the shares will be issued after all claims submitted pursuant to the settlement plans have been received. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In January 2004, we established Premier Management Insurance, Inc. (Premier), an insurance subsidiary, to give us access to re insurance markets, to enhance insurance coverage, and to take advantage of potential future savings in insurance premiums. Premier requires a minimum cash balance of $50 million. As such, $50 million of our cash is deemed restricted and is recorded in the Other noncurrent assets line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, we have a letter of credit that requires cash collateral. On March 31, 2004, the amount totaled $6 million and was also included as restricted cash in the Other noncurrent assets line item. In March 2004, we received approximately $90 million in cash from the sale of our approximate 90% interest in ACCPAC. In April 2004, we received the remaining proceeds of approximately $14 million. See Item 1, Business Business Developments for additional information. During fiscal year 2004, we made several technology acquisitions, including eSecurity Online, Silent Runner, and Miramar Systems. The aggregate purchase price for all acquisitions totaled $53 million, of which $52 million was paid in cash. During fiscal year 2003, we acquired certain consulting businesses and product technologies, which, individually and collectively, were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions totaled approximately $19 million. The Consolidated Statements of Operations reflect the results of operations of the companies since the effective dates of the acquisitions. We pre fund contributions to our broad based, employee defined contribution retirement plan annually each March. Pre funded contributions totaled $45 million in each of the years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003. Peak borrowings under all debt facilities during the fiscal year 2004 totaled approximately $3.1 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.11%. Capital resource requirements as of March 31, 2004 consisted of lease obligations for office space, equipment, mortgage or loan obligations, and amounts due as a result of product and company acquisitions. See Contractual Obligations and Commitments for additional information. It is expected that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines and in the capital markets, and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. We expect our long standing history of providing extended payment terms to our customers to continue. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have commitments to invest approximately $3 million in connection with joint venture agreements. In prior fiscal years, we sold individual accounts receivable under the prior business model to an external third party subject to certain 28 Table of Contents recourse provisions. The amounts subject to recourse approximated $127 million and $141 million as of March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other than the commitments and recourse provisions described above, we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and, accordingly, off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with current accounting rules, the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at March 31, 2004 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. In addition, the table summarizes the timing of payments on our debt obligations as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2004. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (in millions) Long term debt obligations (inclusive of interest) $ 2,590 $ 120 $ 1,614 $ 390 $ 466 Operating lease obligations(1) 476 135 174 80 87 Purchase obligations 34 28 5 1 Other long term liabilities(2) 68 33 15 11 9 Total $ 3,168 $ 316 $ 1,808 $ 482 $ 562 (1) The contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases include sublease income totaling $168 million expected to be received in the following periods: $31 million (less than 1 year); $54 million (13 years); $44 million (35 years); and $39 million (more than 5 years). (2) Other long term liabilities primarily relate to operating expenses associated with operating lease obligations. As of March 31, 2004, we have no material capital lease obligations, either individually or in the aggregate. Subsequent Events The following significant events have occurred subsequent to March 31, 2004. On April 1, 2004, Jeff Clarke was named Chief Financial Officer. On April 26, 2004, we announced that Jeff Clarkes role would be expanded to include the role of Chief Operating Officer. On April 8, 2004, we terminated the employment of Steven Woghin, our former General Counsel. We are actively conducting a search for a new General Counsel. On April 19, 2004, we terminated the employment of nine employees in the Legal and Finance departments as a result of issues raised during the independent investigation by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors into past accounting practices. On April 21, 2004, Sanjay Kumar stepped down as Chairman and CEO and resigned from our Board of Directors. At that time Mr. Kumar was named Chief Software Architect. Mr. Kumar subsequently resigned from the Company. His resignation will be effective June 30, 2004. On April 26, 2004, we named Kenneth D. Cron, an independent Director, Interim Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Cron joined our Board of Directors in 2002. On April 26, 2004, as a result of the independent investigation by the Audit Committee, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Current Report on Form 8 K restating certain financial data for the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2001 and 2000. On April 26, 2004, we announced that Gregory W. Corgan had been appointed Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales, succeeding Stephen Richards, who resigned from his position and was relieved of all duties in April 2004, and is leaving the Company at the end of June 2004. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2005 The outlook for the overall economy and the IT environment, complicated by international conflicts, continues to be difficult to predict. The outlook for our fiscal year 2005 is premised on the assumption that there will be limited to 29 Table of Contents modest improvement in the current economic and IT environments. We also believe that customers will continue to be cautious with their technology purchases. Our preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2005 is to generate revenue in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, an increase of between 7% to 13%, and earnings per share in the range of $0.28 to $0.33. 30 Table of Contents We expect that: Subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue, as well as annualized deferred subscription revenue, should continue to increase during fiscal year 2005 for the same reasons as described in Results of Operations for the fiscal year 2004 increase; Cash generated from operations will exceed $1.28 billion, which may be reduced by any potential fine or penalty, which may be significant, related to the government investigation; Our weighted average license agreement duration will continue to be approximately 3 years; The level of business from distribution and OEM partners for fiscal year 2005 should remain steady or increase slightly from that of fiscal year 2004 as new products are brought to market; As previously disclosed, the Company will be offering more flexible licensing terms to its channel partners and beginning July 1, 2004, we will account for this channel revenue on a subscription, or ratable, basis. We expect that the impact from this change will have the effect of decreasing fiscal 2005 total revenue by approximately $125 million, with an associated impact on earnings of approximately $0.13 per share compared to our previous model. This has been factored into our outlook above; Maintenance revenue as a separate line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations should continue to decrease as deferred maintenance revenue previously recorded under our prior business model is amortized over the term of the original license agreement; Financing fees will continue to decrease as amounts earned from license agreements under our prior business model are amortized over the term of the original license agreement; The level of professional service engagements for fiscal year 2005 should increase slightly from fiscal year 2004, since the formation of the CA Technology Services organization in April 2003 should continue to result in increased efficiency in our services organization; Total SGA expense for fiscal year 2005 will increase approximately 10% due to our expected efforts to expand our international presence, particularly in Asia, open up new distribution call centers, and expand our sales and marketing efforts; We will incur approximately $49 million in stock based compensation charges, representing $40 million relating to our adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 and $9 million of restricted stock expense (we incurred approximately $9 million of pre tax total stock based compensation charges in fiscal year 2004); Product development and enhancement expenditures should increase slightly and continue to constitute a significant portion of total operating expenses in fiscal year 2005; We will renew our 2002 Revolving Credit Facility prior to its expiration on January 31, 2005; Our debt level should remain at approximately $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2005 since there are no scheduled payments due in fiscal year 2005; however, we may elect to redeem the 5% $660 million Convertible Senior Notes at any time after March 21, 2005, at prices declining to par, and we expect to pay the $825 million 6.375% Senior Notes when they come due in April 2005; and The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2005 should be approximately 36%. As a result of a new IRS Revenue Procedure (refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements), we expect that taxes paid will be lower in Fiscal Year 2005 compared to Fiscal Year 2004. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. We believe that the following significant accounting policies are complex and require a high degree of judgment and are therefore critical accounting policies. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources: (1) licensing software products; (2) providing customer technical support (referred to as maintenance); and (3) providing professional services, such as consulting and education. We recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Position 97 2 Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97 2), issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as amended by SOP 98 9 Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. In accordance with SOP 97 2, we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software products when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer; (2) we deliver the products; (3) license agreement terms 31 Table of Contents are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final; and (4) collection is probable. Our software licenses generally do not include acceptance provisions. An acceptance provision allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software. If a license agreement includes an acceptance provision, we do not record deferred subscription revenue or recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or, if not notified by the customer to cancel the license agreement, the expiration of the acceptance period. Under our Business Model, software license agreements include flexible contractual provisions that, among other things, allow customers to receive unspecified future software products for no additional fee. These agreements combine the right to use the software product with maintenance for the term of the agreement. Under these agreements, we are required to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning upon completion of the four SOP 97 2 recognition criteria noted above. For license agreements signed prior to October 2000 (the prior business model), once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met, software license fees were recognized as revenue up front, and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license. Maintenance revenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) combined license and maintenance agreements recorded under the prior business model; and (2) stand alone maintenance agreements. Under the prior business model, maintenance and license fees were generally combined into a single license agreement. The maintenance portion was deferred and amortized into revenue over the initial license agreement term. Many of these license agreements have not reached the end of their initial terms and, therefore, continue to amortize. This amortization is recorded to the Maintenance line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The deferred maintenance portion, which was optional to the customer, was determined using its fair value based on annual, fixed maintenance renewal rates stated in the agreement. For license agreements entered into under our current Business Model, maintenance and license fees continue to be combined; however, the maintenance is no longer optional on an annual basis but rather is inclusive for the entire term. We report such combined fees on the Subscription revenue line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We record stand alone maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance for their non term based license agreements. Maintenance revenue from such renewals is recognized over the term of the renewal agreement. The Deferred maintenance revenue line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheets principally represents payments received in advance of maintenance services rendered. Revenue from professional service arrangements is recognized pursuant to the provisions of SOP 97 2, which in most cases is as the services are performed. Revenues from professional services sold as part of a software transaction are deferred and recognized over the life of the related software transaction. If it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed. Revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and VARs is recognized when all four of the SOP 97 2 revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software product to their customers. This is commonly referred to as the sell through method. We have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and have a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under such agreements. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed upon receipt of cash payment. Our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products. Such warranties are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. Under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements, we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on, among other things, allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. In most cases, in the event of an infringement claim, we retain the right to (i) procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product; (ii) replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be reasonably achieved, we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid. Such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. The indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer. 32 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for the potential impairment of accounts receivable on the balance sheet. In developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts, we rely on several factors, including: Historical information, such as general collection history of multiyear software agreements; Current customer information/events, such as extended delinquency, requests for restructuring, and filing for bankruptcy; Results of analytical analysis of both historical and current data; and The overall economic environment. The allowance is comprised of two components: (a) specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when, based on current information, we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer; and (b) a general allowance for all other receivables. We expect the allowance for doubtful accounts to continue to decline as net installment accounts receivable under the prior business model are billed and collected. Under our Business Model, amounts due from customers are offset by deferred subscription revenue (unearned revenue) related to these amounts, resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet. Therefore, less of an allowance for doubtful accounts is required. Income Taxes When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction; estimate differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement purposes versus tax return purposes (known as temporary differences), which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities; and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We have recognized as a deferred tax asset a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations, which are expected to result in a future tax benefit. As of March 31, 2004, our deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance, totaled $325 million. Realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized. The factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are a result of acquisition expenses, such as duplicate facility costs, employee severance and other costs that are not deductible until paid, foreign net operating losses (NOLs) and temporary differences between the taxable cash payments received from customers and the ratable recognition of revenue in accordance with GAAP. The NOLs expire between 2005 and 2015. An additional valuation allowance of $22 million was established in fiscal year 2004 for certain foreign NOLs and other deferred tax assets we believe might not be realized. Future results may vary from these estimates. At this time it is not practicable to determine if we will need to increase the valuation allowance or if such future valuations will have a material impact on our financial statements. Goodwill, Capitalized Software Products, and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill. Absent any prior indicators of impairment, we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We performed our annual assessment for fiscal year 2004 and concluded that there were no impairments to record. The SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model is a two step process. The first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. 33 Table of Contents Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test, and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test, is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions. These estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management. This approach uses significant assumptions, including projected future cash flow, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flow, and a terminal growth rate. The carrying value of capitalized software products, both purchased software and internally developed software, and other intangible assets, are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of internal and external facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of cost for other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date. It is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or, if such an impairment were to occur, the magnitude thereof. In fiscal year 2004, we recorded an impairment charge of $4 million related to internally developed capitalized software assets. This amount was included in the Other gains/expenses, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation We currently maintain stock option plans and restricted stock awards. Prior to April 1, 2003, we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, (APB No. 25) and related interpretations. Effective April 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148. We selected the prospective method to transition to the fair value method of measuring stock based compensation expense. Under the prospective method, we recognize compensation expense related to all stock awards granted after March 31, 2003. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain stock based awards. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk free interest rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years. The following table sets forth the various estimated effects on future earnings per share as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 123 using the fair market value of our stock as of March 31, 2004 (base price). For purposes of this table, we have assumed that options covering 6.4 million shares are awarded in the last quarter of each fiscal year, which is consistent with fiscal year 2004, but may not be indicative of future option grants. We have assumed $11 million in contributions for each offer period related to the Year 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We have assumed all other variables to be the same as those used for fiscal year 2004, as detailed in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Potential Future Effect on EPS Year Ended March 31, Assumed Exercise Priceof Stock Based Compensation 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 $26.86 (base price) $ (.04 ) $ (.09 ) $ (.13 ) $ (.13 ) $ (.13 ) $20.15 (25% below base price) (.04 ) (.08 ) (.10 ) (.10 ) (.10 ) $33.58 (25% above base price) (.04 ) (.10 ) (.15 ) (.16 ) (.16 ) $40.29 (50% above base price) (.04 ) (.11 ) (.17 ) (.20 ) (.20 ) The above table provides sensitivity analysis related to the granting of stock options and the associated expense incurred over the vesting period of the option. The assumptions used may vary significantly, which can result in a material change to the amounts presented above. Legal Contingencies We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability of a loss and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at 34 Table of Contents the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims, and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material legal proceedings. New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. Issue 03 1 requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures be made for debt and marketable equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity under SFAS No. 115 that are impaired at the balance sheet date, but for which an other than temporary impairment has not been recognized. We adopted EITF No. 03 1 as of March 31, 2004, and the required disclosures have been made (see Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). Risk Factors Current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, or others, many of which are beyond our control, could negatively affect our revenue, profitability, and cash flow. Operating results and revenue are subject to fluctuations caused by many factors. Quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a number of factors, including those listed below, which in turn could adversely affect our revenue, profitability, and cash flow in the future. Demand for products and services; Length of sales cycle; Customer implementation of our products; Magnitude of price and product competition; Introduction of new hardware; General economic conditions in countries in which customers do a substantial amount of business; Customer budgets for hardware and software; Ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced versions of our products; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates; Ability to control costs; The size of licensing transactions; Reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces; The results of litigation, including the government and internal investigations; Ability to retain and attract qualified personnel; and Reaction of customers to our Business Model. Any of the foregoing factors, among others, may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high, or cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate. As a consequence, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow could be adversely affected. The success of our international operations is subject to many factors. International revenue has historically represented a significant percentage of our total worldwide revenue. Continued success in selling our products outside the United States will depend on a variety of factors, including: Reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces; Fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates; Staffing key managerial positions; The ability to successfully localize software products for a significant number of international markets; General economic conditions in foreign countries; Political stability; Trade restrictions such as tariffs, duties, or other controls affecting foreign operations; and The effects of war and terrorism. Any of the foregoing factors, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. We could be subject to fines, penalties, or other sanctions as a result of a joint inquiry by the SEC and U.S. Attorneys Office. We have been responding to an ongoing joint inquiry being conducted by the staff of the Northeast Regional Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York concerning certain of our accounting practices. On January 8, 2004, we received a Wells Notice from the staff of the 35 Table of Contents SEC indicating that the staff is considering recommending that the SEC bring a civil enforcement proceeding against us. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for additional information. We cannot predict the scope, timing, or outcome of the investigation and other matters referred to herein, which may include the institution of administrative, civil injunctive, or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, which may be significant, suspensions or debarments from government contracts, and other remedies and sanctions, any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our credit ratings and ability to obtain financing, an adverse impact on our stock price, loss of additional senior management, the inability to attract or retain key employees, and the loss of customers. In addition, under the law, the illegal acts of our employees may be ascribed to us. We cannot predict what impact, if any, these matters may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. We recorded a $10 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 associated with the pending government investigation. This charge was based on an initial offer we made to the government in connection with settlement discussions associated with the Department of Justice and SEC investigation. We are subject to intense competition, and we expect to face increased competition in the future. The markets for our products are intensely competitive, and we expect both product and pricing competition to increase. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger technical staffs, established relationships with hardware vendors, and or greater financial, technical, and marketing resources. Competitors for our various products include large technology companies. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies and shareware authors that may develop competing products. Our competitors include large vendors of hardware or operating system software. The widespread inclusion of products that perform the same or similar functions as our products within computer hardware or other companies software products could reduce the perceived need for our products, or render our products obsolete and unmarketable. Furthermore, even if these incorporated products are inferior or more limited than our products, customers may elect to accept the incorporated products rather than purchase our products. In addition, the software industry is currently undergoing consolidation as software companies seek to offer more extensive suites and broader arrays of software products, as well as integrated software and hardware solutions. This consolidation may negatively impact our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. See Item 1, Business Competition, for additional information. We have lost senior management employees; it may be difficult to replace these employees and to attract and retain other key personnel. In connection with the investigations described in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, we have lost several members of our senior management, including our former Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers and our General Counsel, as well as several other members of our Finance and Legal departments. These departures have deprived us of the knowledge and skills possessed by certain of these individuals and have left us understaffed in certain areas. Although we are currently conducting searches to replace these individuals, the searches could be time consuming and expensive, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified replacements. In addition, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain other key personnel, including highly qualified sales, consulting, technical, marketing, financial, and legal personnel. Further, integrating new management and other key personnel may be difficult and costly. The inability to find appropriate replacements for senior management, to continue to attract and retain other personnel, and to integrate new personnel could be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flow. Certain software is licensed from third parties. Some of our products contain software licensed from third parties. Some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or enhancement of existing products. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Our products must remain compatible with ever changing operating environments. IBM, HP, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft are the largest suppliers of systems and computing software and, in most cases, are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers. Historically, these operating system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems, systems software, and computer hardware. Such new products could, in the future, incorporate features that perform functions currently performed by our products, or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software. Although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and system software developers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of 36 Table of Contents our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. We have a significant amount of debt. As of March 31, 2004, we had approximately $2.3 billion of debt outstanding, consisting of unsecured fixed rate senior note obligations, convertible senior notes, and unsecured multicurrency credit facilities. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided from operations, and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Our credit ratings have been downgraded and could be downgraded further. Our Moodys and SP credit ratings were recently downgraded. Moodys, SP, or any other credit rating agency may further downgrade or take other negative action with respect to our credit ratings in the future. If our credit ratings are further downgraded or other negative action is taken, we would be required to, among other things, pay additional interest under our credit agreements. Any downgrades could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Customers are still adapting to our Business Model. Our Business Model affords customers significant flexibility in licensing transactions. For example, under our Business Model, we offer software licenses on a month to month or other short term basis in order to allow customers the opportunity to try our software products without committing to a multiyear license obligation. Transactions such as these increase the risk that customers will not fully implement our software and will not enter into a long term relationship with us. Additionally, customer preference for other forms of payment (upfront, annual, or monthly installments) could impact the amount of cash generated from operations in any period. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights would weaken our competitive position. Our future success is dependent upon our proprietary technology. We protect our proprietary information through the use of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, policing unauthorized use or copying of our proprietary information is difficult. Unauthorized use or copying occurs from time to time and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and diversion of resources. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not afford the same degree of protection to our proprietary rights as do the laws of the United States. For example, shrink wrap or click on licenses may be unenforceable in whole or in part in some jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, patents we have obtained may be circumvented, challenged, invalidated, or designed around by other companies. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property for these or other reasons could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. See Item 1, Business Proprietary Rights, for additional information. We may become dependent upon large transactions. We have historically been dependent upon large dollar enterprise transactions with individual customers. As a result of the flexibility afforded by our Business Model, we anticipate that there will be fewer of these transactions in the future. There can be no assurances, however, that we will not be reliant on large dollar enterprise transactions in the future, and the failure to close such transactions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Customer decisions are influenced by general economic conditions. Our products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of our customers information processing resources. However, a general slowdown in the world economy or a particular region could cause customers to delay or forgo decisions to license new products or to upgrade their existing environments, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Third party microcode could impact product development. We anticipate ongoing use of microcode or firmware provided by hardware manufacturers. Microcode and firmware are essentially software programs in hardware form and are, therefore, less flexible than other types of software. We believe that such continued use will not have a significant impact on our operations and that our products will remain compatible with any changes to such code. However, there can be no assurance that future technological developments involving such microcode will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. 37 Table of Contents The software business is marked by easy entry and large, entrenched businesses. Many companies with whom we compete, including IBM, Sun Microsystems, HP, and other large computer manufacturers, have substantial resources, a larger installed base of customers in any particular market niche, as well as the ability to develop and market software programs similar to and competitive with the products offered by us. Additionally, these producers can bundle hardware, software, and services together, which is a disadvantage for us since we do not provide hardware and have far fewer services offerings. Competitive products are also offered by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry. Some, like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP, are the leading developers and vendors in their specialized markets. In addition, new companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis, offering products that compete with those offered by us. Increased competition also results from consolidation of existing companies within the industry. Additionally, many customers historically have developed their own products that compete with those offered by us. Competition from any of these sources can result in price reductions or displacement of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Future product development is dependent upon access to third party operating systems. In the past, licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code, which makes the operating system understandable to programmers; object code, which directly controls the hardware; and other technical documentation. Since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software, which must interface with the operating systems, ISVs such as us were able to develop and market compatible software. Microsoft, IBM, and other vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems. To date, this policy has not had a material effect on us. Some companies, however, may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access. These restrictions may, in the future, result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products. Although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect, there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. The markets for some or all of our key product areas may not grow. We have identified six product areas: infrastructure management, security management, storage management, application life cycle management, data management and application development, and portal and business intelligence. Some or all of these areas may not grow, may decline in growth, or customers may decline or forgo use of products in some or all of these product areas. This is particularly true in newly emerging areas, such as portal and business intelligence. A decline in these product areas could result in decreased demand for our products, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Third parties could claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement of various forms of their intellectual property. Investigation of these claims, whether with or without merit, can be expensive and could affect development, marketing, or shipment of our products. As the number of software patents issued increases, it is likely that additional claims, with or without merit, will be asserted. Defending against such claims is time consuming and could result in significant litigation expense or settlement with unfavorable terms that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in transaction losses. 38 Table of Contents Most of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies. Given the relatively long sales cycle that is typical for many of our products, foreign currency fluctuations could result in substantial changes in the foreign currency impact on these transactions. Additionally, fluctuations of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar can affect our revenue within those markets, all of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Acts of terrorism or war may adversely affect our business. Acts of terrorism, acts of war, and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to our properties, business, employees, suppliers, distributors, resellers, and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Such events may also result in an economic slowdown in the United States or elsewhere, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations. Our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, the gain or loss of significant license agreements, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, changes in domestic and international economic and business conditions, general conditions in the software and computer industries, and other events or factors. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries that are similar or related to those in which we operate and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These market fluctuations have in the past adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, debt, and installment accounts receivable. We have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers (Standard Poors single A rating and higher). To mitigate risk, many of the securities have a maturity date within one year, and holdings of any one issuer, excluding the U.S. government, do not exceed 10% of the portfolio. Periodically, the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. We have shifted from a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments to substantially all fixed rate debt instruments to take advantage of historically low interest rates. As of March 31, 2004, our outstanding debt approximated $2.3 billion, approximately all of which is in fixed rate obligations. If market rates were to decline, we could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates. Each 25 basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $6 million. Each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an immaterial annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of March 31, 2004. Prior to our implementation of the Business Model, we offered financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our software solution sales. The aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element, which can vary with the interest rate environment. Each 25 basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $5 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business on a worldwide basis through branches and subsidiaries in 45 countries. We are therefore exposed to movement in currency exchange rates. As part of our risk management strategy and consistent with prior years, we did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative transactions. In addition, we manage our level of exposure by denominating a majority of international sales and payments of related expense in the local currencies of our subsidiaries. A 1% change in all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would have an insignificant effect on our results from operations. Equity Price Risk As of March 31, 2004, we have minimal investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies. These investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or temporary losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity. It is not customary for us to make investments in equity securities as part of our investment strategy.
