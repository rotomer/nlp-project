Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity, and results of operations. As described in Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Restructuring of the Consolidated Financial Statements, in fiscal year 2004 we divested a subsidiary, ACCPAC International, Inc. (ACCPAC). The assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flow of ACCPAC have been classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented prior to the sale of ACCPAC in March 2004. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations excludes the effect of the discontinued operation. Additionally, the information below reflects the effects of (1) the restatements announced in 2004 as more fully described in Part I, Item 6 of the 2005 Form 10 K/A, (2) the subsequent restatements more fully described in the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10 K/A, and (3) the restatement to reflect the modified retrospective adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) more fully described in Note 9, Stock Plans of the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10 K/A. This Form 10 K/A is not superseding or restating financial statements contained in the companys quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 or any current report on Form 8 K filed subsequent to March 31, 2005. However, the financial statements for the first quarter of the 2005 fiscal year, which are also contained in the Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 for comparison purposes, have been restated in the Amended Form 10 K/A (though not in the Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005). Accordingly, the information in the Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 should be considered in light of the information in the Amended Form 10 K/A. Business Overview We are one of the worlds largest providers of management software. Our software enables our customers to manage their complex IT infrastructures across systems and networks, security, and storage solutions. Our platform neutral, integrated technologies help customers manage the investments they have made in IT and make it possible for them to manage all of the computers, networks, and other technologies that comprise their computing environment. Our products enable customers to better manage and reduce IT costs and risks. Our products participate in a number of high growth areas, including systems and security management, and business services optimization which helps organizations align IT to business processes. Our products include both mainframe and distributed solutions, each of which comprise about half of our revenue. We are focused on four key strategies to drive growth: Internal Product Development In fiscal year 2005, we invested approximately 20 percent of our revenue in research and development to deliver innovative and relevant technology. In particular, we are focused on market leadership in the core areas of systems management and security management. In April 2005, we reorganized our product development group into five business units to enable us to be more accountable to business and customer needs and to be more responsive to the changing dynamics of the management software marketplace. International Expansion We are increasing our investments in emerging markets, such as China, India, and other countries, to expand our reach and to grow sales. Partnerships and relationships with systems integrators and channel participants are of particular importance in these regions. In addition to our focus on enterprise customers, we are pursuing the small and medium sized customer market, particularly in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region. Alternative Routes to Market We have a direct sales force of over 2,200 quota carrying salespeople who generate most of our revenue. However, not all customers buy technology directly from the software vendor, providing additional growth opportunities in the area of indirect sales. Developing further channel partnerships is a top priority for us. To help accelerate the growth of our channel business, we recently launched a new Enterprise Solution Provider Program that makes it easier for customers to buy products and to eliminate potential conflicts between direct and indirect sales channels. 16 Table of Contents We have moved to a named account structure, where our direct sales organization will focus on developing relationships with the largest and most important customers. Other accounts will primarily be serviced by reseller partners. We will also partner with OEMs and global systems integrators that play an important role in determining technology purchases in large enterprises. Channel partnerships will also allow us to more cost effectively pursue the small and medium size customer market and will provide us a larger technical pool from which we can draw resources to provide professional services to our customers. Strategic Acquisitions While internal product development is critical to our long term success, targeted acquisitions of technologies are equally important. We will continue to make small to medium sized acquisitions in our core areas of systems and security management for the enterprise, similar to our recent acquisitions of Pest Patrol, Netegrity, Concord, and Niku. Significant Business Events The Government Investigation In fiscal year 2002, the USAO and the SEC commenced an investigation concerning certain of our past accounting practices, including our revenue recognition procedures in periods prior to the adoption of the Business Model in October 2000. In September 2004, we reached agreements with the USAO and the SEC by entering into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the USAO and by consenting to the SECs filing of a Final Consent Judgment in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the Federal Court). The Federal Court approved the DPA on September 22, 2004 and entered the Final Consent Judgment on September 28, 2004. The agreements resolve the USAO and SEC investigations into certain of our past accounting practices, including our revenue recognition policies and procedures, and obstruction of their investigations. Under the DPA, the Company has agreed to establish a $225 million fund for purposes of restitution to our current and former stockholders, with $75 million paid within 30 days of the date of approval of the DPA by the Court, $75 million to be paid within one year after the approval date and $75 million to be paid within 18 months after the approval date. The Company has made the first $75 million payment. The Company has, among other things, taken the following actions: (1) added two new independent directors to the Board of Directors; (2) established a compliance committee of the Board of Directors by amending the charter of its Audit Committee and renaming it as the Audit and Compliance Committee; (3) appointed a Chief Compliance Officer and began implementation of an enhanced compliance and ethics program; (4) begun to reorganize the Finance Department; (5) established an executive disclosure committee chaired by the Companys chief executive officer; and (6) enhanced the Companys Hotline (now Helpline) and issued the Companys Compliance and Helpline Policy. On March 16, 2005, pursuant to the DPA and Final Consent Judgment, the United States District Court issued an order appointing attorney Lee S. Richards III, Esq., of Richards Spears Kibbe Orbe LLP, to serve as Independent Examiner. The Independent Examiner is reviewing our compliance with the DPA and Final Consent Judgment and reported his findings and recommendations to the USAO, SEC and Board of Directors on or about September 16, 2005, and will do so quarterly thereafter. We issued a report on our progress under the DPA and Final Consent Judgment in the proxy statement filed with the SEC in July 2005. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the government investigation. Acquisitions and Divestures In June 2005, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Niku a leading provider of information technology management and governance solutions, in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $350 million, or approximately $280 million net of cash acquired. Nikus primary software product, Clarity IT MG, is an integrated suite that spans the full IT life cycle, from investment selection, to execution and delivery of initiatives, to results assessment. In January 2005, we had announced we had signed a partnership to resell, service, and support Nikus Clarity software. We anticipate integrating Clarity IT MG with our Business Service Optimization (BSO) unit. The acquisition was completed on July 29, 2005. In June 2005, we acquired the common stock of Concord, a leading provider of network service management software solutions, in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $337 million. We also assumed approximately $20 million in net debt from Concord for a total purchase price of approximately $357 million, excluding acquisition costs. Concord was a provider of infrastructure software principally in the areas of network health, performance, and fault management. 17 Table of Contents We plan to make Concords eHealth and Spectrum software available both as independent products and as integrated components of our Unicenter product portfolio. In November 2004, we completed the acquisition of Netegrity, a leading provider of security software solutions in the area of access and identity management, in a transaction valued at approximately $455 million in the aggregate. Netegrity was a provider of business security software, principally in the areas of identity and access management, and we have made Netegritys identity and access management solutions available both as independent products and as integrated components of our eTrust Identity and Access Management Suite. In August 2004, we acquired Pest Patrol, a privately held provider of anti spyware and security solutions, in an all cash transaction of approximately $40 million. The products acquired in this transaction were integrated into the Companys eTrust Threat Management software product portfolio. This portfolio protects organizations from diverse Internet dangers such as viruses, spam, and inappropriate use of the Web by employees. In March 2004, we sold our approximate 90% interest in ACCPAC. Our net proceeds totaled $104 million for all of our outstanding equity interests of ACCPAC, including options and change of control payments for certain ACCPAC officers and managers. We received approximately $90 million of the net proceeds in fiscal year 2004 and the remainder in fiscal year 2005. ACCPAC specializes in accounting, customer relationship management, human resources, warehouse management, manufacturing, electronic data interchange, and point of sale software for small and medium sized businesses. As a result of the sale, we realized a gain, net of taxes, of approximately $60 million in fiscal year 2004. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we recorded an adjustment to the gain of $2 million, net of tax, that reduced the net gain to $58 million. Approximately 600 of our employees were transferred to Sage in fiscal year 2004. The sale completed our multi year effort to exit the business applications market. Restructuring and Reorganization In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we announced a restructuring plan that was designed to more closely align our investments with strategic growth opportunities. The restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately five percent or 750 positions worldwide, slightly lower than our original estimate of 800 positions. The plan is expected to yield about $70 million in savings on an annualized basis. In connection with the restructuring plan, we recorded a charge of approximately $28 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 for severance and other termination benefits, and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to the restructuring plan. As of March 31, 2005, we have made substantially all payments under the plan. In April 2003 and in connection with the reorganization of the U.S. channel sales organization and the combination of the pre and post sales technical organizations, we eliminated approximately 450 positions worldwide during the quarter ended June 30, 2003. The combination of our pre and post sales organizations resulted in the creation of what we refer to as our CA Technology Services organization. The reorganization of our U.S. channel sales organization included the creation of a 300 person customer interaction call center located in Tampa, Florida. Each of these actions enabled us to achieve efficiencies associated with certain redundant functions that resulted in the elimination of certain positions. We also expensed approximately $15 million of severance and other termination benefits in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 related to the headcount reduction. We estimate that we achieved annual cost savings of approximately $50 million associated with the headcount reductions. Business Model As described in greater detail in Item 1, Business, of the Companys Form 10 K/A, we license our software products directly to customers as well as through distributors, resellers, and VARs. We generate revenue from the following sources: license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis; maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements; and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation, consulting, and education services. The timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a period are determined individually by license agreement, based on its duration and specific terms. Under our Business Model, we provide customers with the flexibility to license software under month to month licenses or to fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements. We also permit customers to change their software mix as their business and technology needs change, which includes the right to receive software in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee. As a result of the right our customers have to receive unspecified future upgrades, we are required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) to recognize revenue from our license agreements evenly on a monthly basis (also known as ratably) over the license term. We believe recognizing license revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement more accurately reflects the earnings process; we also believe that it improves the predictability of our reported revenue streams. Under agreements entered into prior to October 2000 (the prior business model), and as is common practice in the software industry, we did not offer our customers the right to receive unspecified future upgrades. As a result, for most license agreements entered into 18 Table of Contents prior to October 2000, we were required under GAAP to record the present value of the license agreement as revenue at the time the license agreement was signed. Under our Business Model, the portion of the license revenue that has not yet been recognized creates what we refer to as deferred subscription revenue. Deferred subscription revenue is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the license agreements. When recognized, this revenue is reported on the Subscription revenue line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue, the amount deferred is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Not all of our active customer contracts have been transitioned to our Business Model, which has created what we refer to as a Transition Period, during which the license agreements under our prior business model come up for renewal. During this Transition Period, we are building deferred subscription revenue, from which subscription revenue will be amortized. Total deferred subscription revenue, and the associated subscription revenue that comes out of it, is expected to increase over time as we continue to renew customer contracts that were executed under the prior business model, sell additional products and capacity to existing customers, as well as enter into new contracts with new customers. We expect that the majority of contracts executed under the prior business model will be transitioned to our Business Model by the end of fiscal year 2006. While the impact of changing from an up front revenue recognition model to our Business Model initially postponed recognition of amounts that previously would have been recognized earlier under the up front model, we generally did not change our cost structure. Therefore, we have primarily experienced losses since we introduced our Business Model. We expect that our revenues will continue to increase at a greater rate than our expenses. Under both the prior business model and current Business Model, customers often pay for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement. We refer to these payments as installment payments. While the transition to the current Business Model has changed the timing of revenue recognition, in most cases it has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers. As a result, our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the transition to the current Business Model over the past several years. We do not expect any significant changes in our cash generated from operations as a result of this transition. Performance Indicators Management uses several quantitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition. Each provides a measurement of the performance of our Business Model and how well we are executing our plan. Our subscription based Business Model is unique among our competitors in the software industry and particularly during the Transition Period it is difficult to compare our results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors. The following is a summary of the principal quantitative performance indicators that management uses to review performance: Percent For the Year Ended March 31, 2005 2004 Change Change (dollars in millions) (restated) (restated) Subscription revenue $ 2,544 $ 2,101 $ 443 21% Total revenue $ 3,560 $ 3,320 $ 240 7% Subscription revenue as a percent of total revenue 72 % 63 % 9 % 14% New deferred subscription revenue (direct) $ 3,493 $ 2,298 $ 1,195 52% New deferred subscription revenue (indirect) $ 144 N/A N/A N/A Weighted average license agreement duration in years (direct) 3.10 2.78 0.32 12% Cash from continuing operating activities $ 1,527 $ 1,279 $ 248 19% Loss from continuing operations $ (2 ) $ (81 ) $ 79 (98%) Percent As of March 31, 2005 2004 Change Change (dollars in millions) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 3,125 $ 1,902 $ 1,223 64 % Total debt $ 2,636 $ 2,300 $ 336 15 % Analyses of our performance indicators, including general trends, can be found in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MDA. The performance indicators discussed below are those that we believe are unique because of our subscription based Business Model. 19 Table of Contents Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue is the ratable revenue recognized in a period from amounts previously recorded as deferred subscription revenue. If the weighted average life of our license agreements remains constant, an increase in deferred subscription revenue will result in an increase in subscription revenue. Since we expect an increase in deferred subscription revenue in fiscal year 2006, we also expect subscription revenue to continue to increase for that period. New Deferred Subscription Revenue New deferred subscription revenue represents the total undiscounted incremental value (contract value) of subscription software licenses sold in a period. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we began offering more flexible license terms to our channel partners, necessitating ratable recognition of revenue for the majority of our indirect business. Prior to July 1, 2004, such channel license revenue had been recorded on a sell through basis (when a distributor, reseller, or VAR sells the software product to their customers) and reported on the Software fees and other line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. New deferred subscription revenue excludes the value associated with maintenance only license agreements, license only indirect sales, and professional services arrangements and does not include that portion of bundled maintenance or unamortized discounts that get converted into subscription revenue upon renewal of prior business model contracts. New deferred subscription revenue is what we expect to collect over time from our customers based upon contractual license agreements. This amount is recognized as subscription revenue ratably over the applicable software license term. The license agreements that contribute to new deferred subscription revenue represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods generally up to three years. New deferred subscription revenue is sometimes referred to as bookings and is used by management as a gauge of the level of business activity in a particular quarter. Our bookings typically increase in each consecutive fiscal quarter, with the fourth quarter being the strongest. However, since the level of bookings can be impacted by the volume and dollar amount of contracts coming up for renewal, an increase in bookings does not necessarily equate to an increase in billings or cash receipts. The contribution to current period revenue from new deferred subscription revenue from any single license agreement is relatively small, since revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable license agreement term. This diminishes the importance of having to complete transactions prior to the end of a particular quarter and allows us to enter into agreements with terms that are more favorable to the Company. Weighted Average License Agreement Duration in Years The weighted average license agreement duration in years reflects the duration of all software licenses executed during a period, weighted to reflect the contract value of each individual software license. The annual weighted average duration of 3.10 and 2.78 years for the fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively, were derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts and quarterly weighted average durations in years: Fiscal Year 2005 Fiscal Year 2004 Weighted Weighted New Deferred Average New Deferred Average Subscription Duration Subscription Duration Revenue in Years Revenue in Years (dollars in millions) Fourth Quarter $ 1,469 3.40 $ 836 2.70 Third Quarter 845 2.95 670 2.90 Second Quarter 649 2.90 405 2.70 First Quarter 530 2.75 387 2.85 $ 3,493 3.10 $ 2,298 2.78 We believe license agreement durations averaging approximately three years increase the value customers receive from our software licenses by giving customers the flexibility to vary their software mix as their needs change. We also believe this flexibility improves our customer relationships and encourages greater accountability by us to each of our customers. The increase in new deferred subscription revenue and the weighted average duration in years for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 was primarily attributable to the extension of license agreements with two large customers. One agreement has an incremental value of approximately $276 million and has a duration of four years and one agreement has an incremental value at approximately $114 million and has a duration of five years. Excluding these two agreements, the weighted average duration of our license agreements for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 would have been 3.0&nb sp;years. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenue The following table presents the percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the revenue line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2005 Fiscal Year 2004 Percentage Percentage Percentage of of Percentage of of Total Dollar Total Dollar Revenue Change Revenue Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2004 2004 2003 2003 (restated) (restated) (restated) (restated) Revenue: Subscription revenue 72 % 63 % 21 % 63 % 52 % 33 % Maintenance 12 % 16 % (15 %) 16 % 21 % (20 %) Software fees and other 7 % 10 % (23 %) 10 % 12 % (9 %) Financing fees 2 % 4 % (43 %) 4 % 7 % (39 %) Professional services 7 % 7 % 4 % 7 % 8 % (6 %) Total revenue 100 % 100 % 7 % 100 % 100 % 9 % Total Revenue Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased $240 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, to $3.560 billion. This increase was partially a result of the transition to our Business Model, which contributed additional subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year. The increase in total revenue was also partially attributable to the sales of Netegrity products which contributed approximately $32 million of revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2005. In addition, as our international contracts are denominated in local currencies, the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound as well as certain other currencies against the U.S. dollar increased our revenue by approximately $103 million. Total revenue in fiscal year 2005 as compared with fiscal year 2004 was negatively impacted by anticipated decreases in maintenance and financing fees resulting from how these items are accounted for under the Business Model. The recognition of maintenance and financing fees under our Business Model is discussed further under Subscription revenue in this MDA. Our revenues were further negatively impacted by the fact that beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, revenue from certain contracts in our channel business is recorded as new deferred subscription revenue, which will be ratably recognized into subscription revenue in future periods compared to prior periods when the majority of such revenue was recognized up front. Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased $263 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, to $3.320 billion. This increase in total revenue was primarily due to the transition to our Business Model that began during the third quarter of fiscal year 2001. This transition resulted in an increase in subscription revenue from fiscal year 2003, partially offset by an anticipated decrease in maintenance and financing fees as described below. Professional services and software fees and other revenue collectively decreased by $47 million for fiscal year 2004 as described below. In addition, in fiscal year 2004, there was a positive impact to revenue of $173 million compared to fiscal year 2003 due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily associated with the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. Continued cautious capital spending by our existing and potential customers impacted bookings of new license agreements and revenue in fiscal year 2004. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue represents the portion of revenue ratably recognized on software license agreements entered into under our Business Model. Many of the licenses recorded between October 2000, when our Business Model was implemented, and the end of fiscal year 2005 continued to contribute to subscription revenue on a monthly, ratable basis. As a result, subscription revenue for fiscal year 2005 includes the ratable recognition of bookings recorded in fiscal year 2005, as well as bookings recorded between October 2000 and the end of fiscal year 2004. This is the primary reason for the increase in subscription revenue in fiscal year 2005 versus fiscal year 2004. Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased $443 million from fiscal year 2004, to $2.544 billion. For the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, we added new deferred subscription revenue related to our direct business of $3.493 billion and $2.298 billion, respectively. Licenses executed under our Business Model in the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 had weighted average durations of 3.1 and 2.8 years, respectively. Annualized deferred subscription revenue represents the total value of all new software license agreements entered into during a period divided by the weighted average life of all such license agreements recorded during the same period. Annualized 21 Table of Contents deferred subscription revenue related to our direct business increased approximately $301 million, or 36%, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 over the comparable prior fiscal year to $1.127 billion. In addition, we recorded $144 million of new deferred subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 related to our indirect business. Subscription revenue was further increased as a result of how we record maintenance revenue under our Business Model as described below. Approximately 8% of the deferred subscription revenue balance at March 31, 2005 is associated with multi year contracts signed with the U.S. Federal Government and are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval. Under the prior business model, maintenance revenue was separately identified and was reported on the Maintenance line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under the Business Model, maintenance that is bundled with product sales is not separately identified in our customers license agreements and therefore is included within the Subscription revenue line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under the prior business model, financing revenue was also separately identified on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under the Business Model, financing fees are no longer applicable and the entire contract value is now recognized as subscription revenue over the term of the contract. The quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the increase in subscription revenue is not determinable. Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 increased $523 million from fiscal year 2003 to $2.101 billion. Similar to the increase in fiscal year 2005, the increase was primarily due to our transition to our Business Model. Fiscal year 2004 included subscription revenue earned from prior business model software license agreements that renewed during fiscal year 2004. These license agreements did not contribute to revenue in fiscal year 2003. During fiscal years 2004 and 2003, we added new deferred subscription revenue of $2.298 billion and $1.883 billion, respectively. Maintenance As expected, maintenance revenue for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 continued to decline, reflecting a decrease of $79 million and $128 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $441 million and $520 million, respectively. The decrease in maintenance revenue for both years reflects the transition to and increased number of license agreements executed under our Business Model, where maintenance revenue, bundled along with license revenue, is reported on the Subscription revenue line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The combined maintenance and license revenue on these types of license agreements is recognized on a monthly basis ratably over the term of the agreement. The decrease was partially offset by new maintenance revenue earned from customers who elected optional maintenance at the expiration of their non term based license agreements. The quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the decrease in maintenance revenue is not determinable since maintenance bundled with software licenses under our Business Model is not separately identified. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, maintenance revenue from our indirect business increased $36 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, to $59 million. Software Fees and Other Software fees and other revenue consist of revenue related to distribution and OEM partners that have been recorded on a sell through basis, revenue associated with joint ventures, royalty revenues, and other revenue. Revenue related to distribution partners and OEMs is sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, software fees and other revenue decreased $77 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, to $254 million. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we began offering more flexible license terms to our channel partners, which necessitates the deferral of revenue for the majority of our channel business. The ratable recognition of this deferred revenue is reflected on the Subscription revenue line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company experienced approximately a 19% increase in the dollar amount of indirect license contract bookings in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 versus the comparable prior fiscal year. Indirect license contract bookings represent the total undiscounted incremental value of all licenses sold as part of our channel business. The increase in bookings resulted in $144 million of new deferred subscription revenue related to the channel business that will be deferred and recognized ratably as Subscription revenue over the term of the applicable software licenses. In addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, $54 million and $66 million, respectively, of indirect maintenance revenue was deferred. These amounts are amortized into revenue over the term of the arrangement on the Maintenance line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The decrease in software fees and other revenue was partially offset by approximately $21 million of license revenue associated with the sale of Netegrity products and an approximate $10 million benefit associated with the resolution of a prior business model contract dispute in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, software fees and other decreased $33 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003, to $331 million. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the amount of channel sales recognized as deferred maintenance of approximately $53 million over the fiscal year ended March 31, 2003. This deferred maintenance will be amortized into revenue over time on the Maintenance line item on the Consolidated 22 Table of Contents Statements of Operations. The decrease in software fees and other was partially offset by an increase in the amount of indirect license revenue recorded in fiscal year 2004 as compared with fiscal year 2003. Financing Fees Financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under the prior business model, which required up front revenue recognition. This discount initially reduced the related installment accounts receivable and was referred to as Unamortized discounts. The related unamortized discount is amortized over the life of the applicable license agreement and is reported as financing fees. Under our Business Model, additional unamortized discounts are no longer recorded, since we no longer recognize revenue on an up front basis for sales of products with extended payment terms. As expected, for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, financing fees continued to decline, reflecting a decrease of $57 million and $85 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $77 million and $134 million, respectively. The decrease in financing fee revenue for both years is attributable to the discontinuance of offering license agreements under the prior business model and is expected to decline to zero over the next several years. Professional Services Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2005 increased $10 million from fiscal year 2004 to $244 million. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in security software engagements, which utilize Access Control and Identity Management solutions as well as growth in IT Service and Asset Management solutions. The increase was also partially attributable to approximately $4 million of services revenue associated with the sale of Netegrity products. This increase in services revenue was limited due to an increase in services sold in combination with related software products of approximately $14 million, which requires that such services revenue be recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period. Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2004 decreased $14 million from fiscal year 2003 to $234 million. The decrease was a result of the weak spending environment that affected the IT service sector in general, our continued shift in focus to professional services engagements that are focused solely on our software products, as well as services sold in combination with related software products of approximately $6 million, which requires that such services revenue be recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period. Our professional services headcount was reduced by approximately 250 as a result of the creation of our CA Technology Services group in April 2003. Quantification of the impact that these factors had on the decrease in professional services revenue is not determinable. Total Revenue by Geography The following table presents the amount of revenue earned from the United States and international geographic regions and corresponding percentage changes for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2005 Fiscal Year 2004 (dollars in millions) (restated) (restated) (restated) (restated) 2005 2004 Change 2004 2003 Change United States $ 1,838 $ 1,755 5 % $ 1,755 $ 1,748 International 1,722 1,565 10 % 1,565 1,309 20 % $ 3,560 $ 3,320 7 % $ 3,320 $ 3,057 9 % International revenue increased $157 million, or 10%, in fiscal year 2005 as compared with fiscal year 2004. The increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to a positive impact to revenue from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $103 million for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004. The increase in foreign currency exchange is primarily associated with the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. The increase was also a result of an increase in contract bookings in prior periods associated with our European business. The increase in revenue from the United States was primarily attributable to an increase in contract booking in prior periods as well as an increase in professional services revenue. The increase was partially offset by decreases in revenue from maintenance, finance fees, and software fees and other revenue. International revenue increased $256 million, or 20%, in fiscal year 2004 as compared with fiscal year 2003. The increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to a positive impact to revenue from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $173 million for fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003, which was primarily caused by the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. The increase was also a result of an increase in contract bookings in prior periods associated with our European business. Despite an increase in fiscal year 2004 of combined subscription, maintenance, and financing revenue in the United States of approximately $59 million, compared with fiscal year 2003, total revenue in the United States declined slightly primarily due to a decrease in professional services revenue and software fees and other. Price changes and inflation did not have a material impact in fiscal years 2005, 2004, or 2003. 23 Table of Contents Expenses The following table presents expenses as a percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the expense line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2005 Fiscal Year 2004 Percentage Percentage Percentage of of Percentage of of Total Dollar Total Dollar Revenue Change Revenue Change 2005/ 2004/ 2005 2004 2004 2004 2003 2003 (restated) (restated) (restated) (restated) Operating expenses: Amortization of capitalized software costs 13 % 14 % (3 %) 14 % 15 % Cost of professional services 6 % 7 % 2 % 7 % 8 % (7 %) Selling, general, and administrative 38 % 39 % 4 % 39 % 45 % (6 %) Product development and enhancements 20 % 21 % 2 % 21 % 23 % 1 % Commission and royalties 10 % 8 % 27 % 8 % 8 % 10 % Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets 4 % 4 % (3 %) 4 % 5 % (4 %) Goodwill impairment 3 % (100 %) Other gains/expenses, net 2 % N/A 2 % 3 % (45 %) Restructuring charge 1 % N/A Shareholder litigation and government investigation settlements 7 % 5 % 39 % 5 % N/A Total operating expenses 97 % 99 % 5 % 99 % 109 % (1 %) Interest expense, net 3 % 4 % (9 %) 4 % 6 % (31 %) Note Amounts may not add to their respective totals due to rounding. Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and capitalized internally generated software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software costs are related to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage. Amortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 decreased $16 million and $2 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $447 million and $463 million, respectively. The total decrease for both years was due primarily to certain purchased software assets becoming fully amortized. We recorded amortization of purchased software products for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 of $406 million, $423 million, and $430 million, respectively. We recorded amortization of capitalized internally generated software development costs for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 of $41 million, $40 million, and $35 million, respectively. Cost of Professional Services Cost of professional services consists primarily of the personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2005 increased $5 million from fiscal year 2004 to $229 million. This increase was partially offset by approximately $12 million of professional services costs related to services sold in combination with related software products, which requires that the total estimated cost of such services be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period. Cost of professional services for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 included approximately $4 million and $5 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense associated with the Companys adoption of the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) under the modified retrospective application method. Refer to Note 9, Stock Plans for additional information. The improvement in professional services gross margin is attributable to a more effective utilization of professional staff associated with slightly reduced headcount and increased professional services revenue. Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2004 decreased $18 million from fiscal year 2003 to $224 million. This decrease was due primarily to the reduction in professional services engagements, a reduction in personnel costs resulting from efficiencies associated with the combination of our pre sales and post sales professional services organizations in fiscal year 2004, and a reduction of $3 million due to an increase in services sold in combination with related software products, which requires that the total estimated cost of such services be deferred and recognized ratably 24 Table of Contents over the life of the related software contract period. Cost of professional services for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 included approximately $5 million of stock based compensation expense. Selling, General, and Administrative (SGA) SGA expenses for fiscal year 2005 increased $46 million from fiscal year 2004 to $1.346 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs. SGA for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 included approximately $53 million and $59 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense. In addition, in fiscal year 2005 we recorded a credit of approximately $25 million for the provision of doubtful accounts, which is lower than the credit of $53 million we recorded in fiscal year 2004. The credit in the provision for doubtful accounts is a result of the reduction in the prior business model accounts receivable. Under the Business Model, amounts due from customers are offset by related deferred subscription revenue, resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet. In addition, under the Business Model, customer payments are often received in advance of revenue recognition, which results in a reduced net credit exposure. Each of these items reduces the need to provide for estimated bad debts. SGA for the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 also included approximately $24 million and $30 million, respectively, of legal expenses related to the government investigation and, for the year ended March 31, 2005, included $31 million for consulting and other fees associated with our Sarbanes Oxley compliance program. Further, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, we realized a gain of approximately $8 million on the sale of an investment that was included in SGA. SGA expenses for fiscal year 2004 decreased $84 million from fiscal year 2003 to $1.300 billion. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the provision of doubtful accounts of $121 million. As noted above, this decrease is a result of how we account for contractual commitments under the Business Model. The decrease in SGA was partially offset by a $15 million expense for severance and other termination benefits in connection with the reorganization of the U.S. channel sales organization and the creation of CA Technology Services in April 2003, as well as other increases in personnel and related costs. In addition, we incurred legal and other professional service expenses associated with the investigations conducted by the Audit Committee, the SEC, and the U.S. Attorneys Office of approximately $30 million, which represents an increase of approximately $24 million from fiscal year 2003. SGA for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 each included approximately $59 million and $78 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense. Product Development and Enhancements For fiscal year 2005, product development and enhancement expenditures, also referred to as research and development, increased $11 million compared to fiscal year 2004 to $704 million. Product development and enhancement expenditures were approximately 20% and 21% of total revenue for fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Product development and enhancements for the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 included approximately $31 million and $33 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense. During fiscal year 2005, we continued to focus on and invest in product development and enhancements for emerging technologies such as wireless, Web services and on demand computing, as well as a broadening of our enterprise product offerings. Product development and enhancement expenditures for fiscal year 2004 increased $5 million from fiscal year 2003 to $693 million. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in general operating expenditures, as we continue to invest in product development and enhancements such as emerging technologies and a general broadening of our enterprise product offerings. Product development and enhancement expenditures were approximately 21% and 23% of total revenue in each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Product development and enhancements for the years ended March 31, 2004 and 2003 included approximately $33 million and $44 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense. Commissions and Royalties Commissions and royalties for fiscal year 2005 increased $72 million from fiscal year 2004 to $339 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in new deferred subscription revenue recorded in fiscal year 2005 on which sales commissions are based, as compared with fiscal year 2004. Commissions are expensed in the period that they are earned by employees, which is typically in the period we record the related deferred subscription revenue. Commissions and royalties for fiscal year 2004 increased $24 million from fiscal year 2003 to $267 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in new deferred subscription revenue recorded in fiscal year 2004 as compared with fiscal year 2003. The increase was partially offset by a $14 million reduction in royalties to third parties, as we continue to focus on internal product development and enhancements. 25 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal year 2005 decreased $4 million from fiscal year 2004 to $130 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets from past acquisitions becoming fully amortized. Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal year 2004 decreased $6 million from fiscal year 2003 to $134 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets from past acquisitions becoming fully amortized. Goodwill Impairment During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2005 and 2004, we performed our annual goodwill impairment review under SFAS No. 142 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for additional information about our annual review process. As a result of our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $80 million related to our professional services organization. The impairment was attributable to our lower than expected results and our projected performance at the date of the review. Other Gains/Expenses, Net Gains and losses attributable to sales of fixed assets, certain foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and certain other infrequent events have been included in the Other gains/expenses, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The components of Other gains/expenses, net are as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) (Gains) losses attributable to sales of fixed assets $ $ (19 ) $ 3 Expenses attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 8 41 66 (Gains) expenses attributable to legal settlements (13 ) 26 15 Impairment of capitalized software 4 Payment to Ranger Governance Ltd 10 Total $ (5 ) $ 52 $ 94 Restructuring Charge In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we announced a restructuring plan that was designed to more closely align our investments with strategic growth opportunities. The restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately five percent or 750 positions worldwide, slightly lower than our original estimate of 800 positions. The plan is expected to yield about $70 million in savings on an annualized basis. In connection with the restructuring plan, we recorded a charge of approximately $28 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 for severance and other termination benefits, and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this restructuring plan. As of March 31, 2005, we have made substantially all payments under the plan. Shareholder Litigation and Government Investigation Settlement In prior fiscal years, a number of stockholder class action lawsuits were initiated that alleged, among other things, that the Company made misleading statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in connection with the Companys financial performance. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the shareholder litigation. In August 2003, we announced the settlement of all outstanding litigation related to these actions. Under the settlement, we agreed to issue a total of up to 5.7 million shares of common stock to the shareholders represented in the three class action lawsuits, including payment of attorneys fees. In January 2004, approximately 1.6 million settlement shares were issued along with approximately $3.3 million to the plaintiffs attorneys for attorney fees and related expenses. In March 2004, approximately 200,000 settlement shares were issued to participants and beneficiaries of the CASH Plan. On October 8, 2004, the Federal Court signed an order approving the distribution of the remaining 3.8 million settlement shares, less administrative expenses. All the remaining shareholder litigation settlement shares were issued in December 2004. Of the 3.8 million settlement shares, approximately 51,000 were used for the payment of administrative expenses in connection with the settlement, approximately 76,000 were liquidated for cash distributions to class members entitled to receive a cash distribution, and the remaining settlement shares were distributed to class members entitled to receive a distribution of shares. The final shareholder litigation settlement value of approximately $174 million was calculated using the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closing price of our common stock on December 14, 2004, the date the settlement shares were issued, and also includes certain administrative costs associated with the settlement. An initial estimate for the value of 26 Table of Contents the shareholder litigation settlement was established on August 22, 2003. The chart below summarizes the NYSE closing price of our common stock and the estimated value of the shareholder litigation settlement since the initial estimate was established. Shareholder NYSE Closing Litigation Settlement Stock Price Estimated Value (in millions) December 14, 2004 $31.03 $174 September 30, 2004 26.30 156 June 30, 2004 28.06 163 March 31, 2004 26.86 158 December 31, 2003 27.34 158 September 30, 2003 26.11 150 August 22, 2003 25.00 144 The shareholder litigation settlement expense for fiscal year 2005 of $16 million was a result of the increase in our stock price since March 31, 2004. The aggregate shareholder litigation settlement expense recorded was $174 million, including $158 million in fiscal year 2004. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In September 2004, we reached agreements with the USAO and the SEC in connection with their investigations of improper recognition of revenue and related reporting practices during the period January 1, 1998 through September 30, 2000, and the actions of certain former employees to impede the investigations. Under the DPA, we agreed, among other things, to establish a restitution fund of $225 million to compensate present and former Company shareholders for losses caused by the misconduct of certain former Company executives. In connection with the DPA, we recorded a $10 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 and $218 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 associated with the establishment of the shareholder restitution fund and related administrative fees. The first payment of $75 million was made during the third quarter of fiscal year 2005. The second payment of $75 million will be made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and the final payment of $75 million will be made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net for fiscal year 2005 decreased $11 million as compared to fiscal year 2004 to $106 million. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in our average cash balance during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, which resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $28 million. The decrease in interest expense was partially reduced by additional interest expense of $8 million incurred as a result of the issuance of the 2005 Senior Notes and an increase in the weighted average interest rate, which resulted in a $9 million increase in interest expense. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MDA and Note 6, Debt of the Consolidated Financial Statements and for additional information. Interest expense, net for fiscal year 2004 decreased $52 million as compared to fiscal year 2003 to $117 million. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in average debt outstanding, which resulted in a $46 million decrease in interest expense; a reduction in the weighted average interest rate, which resulted in a $9 million decrease in interest expense; and accelerated amortization of financing fees in the third quarter of fiscal year 2003. This decrease was partially offset by a $3 million gain related to the early retirement of a portion of outstanding debt in fiscal year 2003. Operating Margins For fiscal year 2005, our pretax income from continuing operations was $2 million as compared to a pretax loss from continuing operations of $98 million in fiscal year 2004. The improvement in operating margins was primarily related to an increase in revenue and an improvement in cost controls, partially offset by the shareholder litigation and government investigation settlement expense of $234 million recorded in fiscal year 2005. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately 200%, 17%, and 24% for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Refer to Note 8, Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The income tax expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 includes a charge of $55 million or $0.09 per share reflecting the estimated cost of repatriating approximately $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. We received a benefit of approximately $35 million or $0.06 per share in the quarter ending June 30, 2005 reflecting the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Notice 2005 38 issued on May 10, 2005 27 Table of Contents which will substantially reduce the taxes associated with the repatriation. Income tax expense was partially offset by a $26 million or $0.04 per share tax benefit attributable to a refund claim originally made for additional tax benefits associated with prior fiscal years. We received a letter from the IRS approving the claim for this refund in September 2004. Selected Quarterly Information The following table has been adjusted to reflect the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) (refer to Note 9, Stock Plans of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). In addition, as disclosed under the Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item I of the Companys Form 10 K/A, the selected quarterly financial data has been restated.

(6) Includes an after tax charge of $10 million related to the government investigation (refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and an after tax credit of approximately $28 million related to a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts (refer to Note 5, Trade and Installment Accounts receivable of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $3.125 billion on March 31, 2005, an increase of $1.223 billion from the March 31, 2004 balance of $1.902 billion. Cash generated from continuing operating activities for fiscal year 2005 was $1.527 billion, an increase of $248 million from the prior years cash from continuing operations of $1.279 billion. Cash generated from continuing operating activities was positively impacted by a decrease in taxes paid of approximately $411 million. The decrease in taxes paid during fiscal year 2005 was primarily attributable to a new IRS Revenue Procedure, which grants taxpayers a twelve month deferral for cash received from customers to the extent such receipts were not recognized in revenue for financial statement purposes. In addition, cash generated from continuing 28 Table of Contents operating activities was positively impacted by a reduction in cash paid for interest of approximately $17 million. Cash generated from continuing operations activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 was negatively impacted by the $75 million payment in connection with agreements reached with the USAO and the SEC. Refer to Other matters below for additional information. During fiscal year 2005, we issued $1 billion of Senior Notes and redeemed approximately $660 million in outstanding debt compared to a net debt reduction of approximately $826 million in fiscal year 2004. During fiscal year 2004, we used existing cash balances and cash from operations to repay approximately $826 million in outstanding debt compared to a net debt reduction of approximately $730 million in fiscal year 2003. As of March 31, 2005 and 2004, our debt arrangements consisted of the following: 2005 2004 Maximum Outstanding Maximum Outstanding Debt Arrangements Available Balance Available Balance (in millions) 2002 Revolving Credit Facility (terminated December 2004) $ $ $ 470 $ 2004 Revolving Credit Facility (expires December 2008) 1,000 Commercial paper 400 400 6.375% Senior Notes due April 2005 825 825 5.000% Convertible Senior Notes (called March 2005) 660 6.500% Senior Notes due April 2008 350 350 4.750% Senior Notes due November 2009 500 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009 460 460 5.625% Senior Notes due November 2014 500 International line of credit 5 5 Other 1 5 Total $ 2,636 $ 2,300 At March 31, 2005, we had $2.636 billion in debt and $3.125 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our net liquidity position was, therefore, approximately $489 million. We expect to use existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to pay our debt balances as they mature and, based on historical precedent, we expect to continue to generate annual cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion. In December 2004, we entered into a new unsecured, revolving credit facility (the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility). The maximum amount available at any time under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility is $1 billion. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility expires December 2008 and no amount was drawn as of March 31, 2005. Refer to Note 6, Debt of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The new credit facility replaces the 2002 Revolving Credit Facility that was due to expire in January 2005. The 2002 Revolving Credit Facility was terminated effective December 2, 2004 and was undrawn as of that date. In November 2004, we issued an aggregate of $1 billion of unsecured senior notes (2005 Senior Notes) in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A. We issued $500 million of 4.75%, 5 year notes due November 2009 and $500 million of 5.625%, 10 year notes due November 2014. Refer to Note 6, Debt of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In March 2005, we redeemed our outstanding $660 million aggregate principal amount 5% Convertible Senior Notes (5% Notes) that were due March 15, 2007. The 5% Notes were issued in fiscal year 2002 and were eligible to be called for redemption as of March 2005. Substantially all of the 5% Note holders converted their holdings into common stock of the Company (aggregate 27 million shares). Refer to Note 6, Debt of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In March 2005, we exercised our call spread repurchase option that was entered into concurrently with the issuance of the 5% Convertible Senior Notes in 2002, to buy 27 million shares of our common stock at the exercise price of $24.83 (aggregate price $673 million). In April 2005, we repaid, as scheduled, the $825 million 6.375% Senior Notes with our available cash balances. In the remainder of fiscal year 2006, we expect to use cash balances for acquisitions of strategic technology, for continued investment in product development and enhancements, to pay dividends, and to repurchase our common stock, as approved by the Board of Directors. 29 Table of Contents We repurchased approximately $161 million of common stock in connection with our publicly announced corporate buyback program in fiscal year 2005 compared with $56 million in fiscal year 2004; we received approximately $73 million in proceeds resulting from the exercise of Company stock options in fiscal year 2005 compared with $57 million in fiscal year 2004; and we paid dividends of $47 million in each of the fiscal years 2005 and 2004. As announced in April 2005, beginning in fiscal year 2006 we intend to increase our annual cash dividend to $0.16 per share, which is expected to be paid out in quarterly installments of $0.04 per share as and when declared by the Board of Directors. Other Matters In June 2005, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Niku Corporation (Niku), a leading provider of information technology management and governance solutions, in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $350 million, or approximately $280 million net of cash acquired. Nikus primary software product, Clarity IT MG, is an integrated suite that spans the full IT life cycle, from investment selection, to execution and delivery of initiatives, to results assessment. In January 2005, we had announced we had signed a partnership to resell, service, and support Nikus Clarity software. We anticipate integrating Clarity IT MG with our Business Service Optimization (BSO) unit. The acquisition was completed on July 29, 2005. In June 2005, we acquired the common stock of Concord, a leading provider of network service management software solutions, in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $337 million. We also assumed approximately $20 million in net debt from Concord for a total purchase price of approximately $357 million, excluding acquisition costs. In March 2005, we announced the settlement of a lawsuit we filed alleging that Quest Software, Inc. (Quest) used our proprietary information and infringed our intellectual property rights in the development of database administration products. The settlement agreement also resolves Quests counterclaims challenging the validity of certain of our copyrights. As part of the settlement, Quest paid us $16 million and has agreed to pay royalties for future product sales under a non exclusive licensing agreement. Under the agreement, neither we nor Quest made any admission regarding fault or liability. As a result of the settlement, we reported a $16 million gain that is included in Other gains/expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In March 2005, we sold our remaining interest in Viewpoint Corporation (Viewpoint), in a private sale for $12 million, net of fees. As a result of the sale, we reported an $8 million gain that is included in SGA in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At the time of the sale, we controlled more than 5% of Viewpoints outstanding common stock. In November 2004, Fitch Ratings initiated rating of our long term and short term debt. This debt is currently rated in the investment grade rating band. Our senior unsecured notes are rated Ba1 and BBB by Moodys Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, respectively, and are on stable outlook. Our senior unsecured notes are rated BBB by SP and the outlook is negative. Our CP program is rated A 3, Not Prime, and F 3 by Standard Poors, Moodys Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings, respectively. In September 2004, we reached agreements with the USAO and the SEC in connection with improper recognition of revenue and related reporting practices during the period January 1, 1998 through September 30, 2000, and the actions of certain former employees to impede the investigations. Under the related DPA, we agreed, among other things, to establish a restitution fund of $225 million to compensate present and former Company shareholders for losses caused by the misconduct of certain former Company executives. In connection with the DPA, we recorded a $10 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 and $218 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 associated with the establishment of the shareholder restitution fund and related administrative fees. The first payment of $75 million was made during the third quarter of fiscal year 2005. The second payment of $75 million will be made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and the final payment of $75 million will be made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In September 2004, we announced a restructuring plan that was designed to more closely align our investments with strategic growth opportunities. The restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately five percent or 750 positions worldwide, slightly lower than our original estimate of 800 positions. The plan is expected to yield about $70 million in savings on an annualized basis. In connection with the restructuring plan, we recorded a charge of approximately $28 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 for severance and other termination benefits, and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this restructuring plan. As of March 31, 2005, we have made substantially all payments under the plan. In fiscal year 2005, we made several strategic acquisitions to complement certain of our product lines. These included Netegrity, a provider of business security software and Pest Patrol, a privately held provider of anti spyware solutions. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately $505 million, of which $469 million was paid in 30 Table of Contents cash. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Restructuring, of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our acquisition of Pest Patrol and Netegrity. In fiscal year 2004, we acquired certain assets from eSecurity Online, Silent Runner, and Miramar Systems. The aggregate purchase price for these assets totaled $53 million, of which $52 million was paid in cash. In March 2004, we received approximately $90 million in cash from the sale of our approximate 90% interest in ACCPAC. In April 2004, we received the remaining proceeds of approximately $14 million. See Item 1, Business Business Developments in the 2005 Form 10 K/A for additional information. In January 2004, we established Premier Management Insurance, Inc. (Premier), an insurance subsidiary, to give us access to re insurance markets, to enhance insurance coverage, and to take advantage of potential future savings in insurance premiums. Premier requires a minimum cash balance of $50 million. As such, $50 million of our cash is deemed restricted and was recorded in the Other noncurrent assets line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, we reported restricted cash balances of $17 million and $6 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which were included in the Other noncurrent assets line item. In October 2003, we established a software development center in Hyderabad, India (the India Technology Center) for the purpose of enhancing our development and support capabilities and to take advantage of certain incentives made available by the Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) in accordance with local law. We currently employ approximately 770 professionals and have approximately 135,000 square feet of commercially leased office space in Hyderabad. In February 2004, we entered into a definitive agreement with the GoAP to acquire more than 30 acres in an undeveloped Software Technology Park zone outside Hyderabad, where we intend to construct a development facility. We have delivered a $2 million bank guarantee in favor of the GoAP to secure our title to the 30 acre site. To date, we have invested approximately $30 million in connection with operations of the India Technology Center, related capital equipment, and early stage planning for the development of our facility in Hyderabad. In April 2003, we received $18 million in proceeds related to the sale of certain fixed assets. Since the fixed assets were fully depreciated, the entire amount was recorded as a gain in the quarter ended June 30, 2003. We pre fund contributions to our broad based, employee defined contribution retirement plan annually each March. Pre funded contributions totaled $45 million in each of the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004. Peak borrowings under all debt facilities during the fiscal year 2005 totaled approximately $3.3 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. Capital resource requirements as of March 31, 2005 consisted of lease obligations for office space, equipment, mortgage or loan obligations, and amounts due as a result of product and company acquisitions. Refer to Contractual Obligations and Commitments for additional information. It is expected that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines and in the capital markets, and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. We expect our long standing history of providing extended payment terms to our customers to continue. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have commitments to invest approximately $3 million in connection with joint venture agreements. In prior fiscal years, we sold individual accounts receivable under the prior business model to an external third party subject to certain recourse provisions. The outstanding principal balance subject to recourse of these receivables approximated $183 million and $207 million as of March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of March 31, 2005, we have not incurred any losses related to these receivables. Other than the commitments and recourse provisions described above, we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and, accordingly, off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with current accounting rules, the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business. 31 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at March 31, 2005 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. In addition, the table summarizes the timing of payments on our debt obligations as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2005. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (in millions) Long term debt obligations (inclusive of interest) $ 3,132 $ 912 $ 168 $ 1,421 $ 631 Operating lease obligations(1) 499 128 165 89 117 Purchase obligations 27 10 8 2 7 Other long term liabilities(2) 97 33 24 17 23 Total $ 3,755 $ 1,083 $ 365 $ 1,529 $ 778 (1) The contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases include sublease income totaling $132 million expected to be received in the following periods: $30 million (less than 1 year); $49 million (1 3 years); $34 million (3 5 years); and $19 million (more than 5 years). (2) Other long term liabilities primarily relate to operating expenses associated with operating lease obligations. As of March 31, 2005, we have no material capital lease obligations, either individually or in the aggregate. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. We consider the following significant accounting polices to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources: (1) licensing software products; (2) providing customer technical support (referred to as maintenance); and (3) providing professional services, such as consulting and education. We recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Position 97 2 Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97 2), issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as amended by SOP 98 9 Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. In accordance with SOP 97 2, we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software products when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer; (2) we deliver the products; (3) license agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final; and (4) collection is probable. Our software licenses generally do not include acceptance provisions. An acceptance provision allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software. If a license agreement includes an acceptance provision, we do not record deferred subscription revenue or recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or, if not notified by the customer to cancel the license agreement, the expiration of the acceptance period. Under our Business Model, software license agreements include flexible contractual provisions that, among other things, allow customers to receive unspecified future software products for no additional fee. These agreements combine the right to use the software product with maintenance for the term of the agreement. Under these agreements, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning upon completion of the four SOP 97 2 recognition criteria noted above. For license agreements signed prior to October 2000 (the prior business model), once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met, software license fees were recognized as revenue up front, and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license. Maintenance revenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) combined license and maintenance agreements recorded under the prior business model; and (2) stand alone maintenance agreements. Under the prior business model, maintenance and license fees were generally combined into a single license agreement. The maintenance portion was deferred and amortized into revenue over the initial license agreement term. Many of these license agreements have not reached the end of their initial terms and, therefore, continue to amortize. This amortization 32 Table of Contents is recorded to the Maintenance line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The deferred maintenance portion, which was optional to the customer, was determined using its fair value based on annual, fixed maintenance renewal rates stated in the agreement. For license agreements entered into under our current Business Model, maintenance and license fees continue to be combined; however, the maintenance is no longer optional on an annual basis but rather is inclusive for the entire term. We report such combined fees on the Subscription revenue line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We record stand alone maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance for their non term based license agreements. Maintenance revenue from such renewals is recognized over the term of the renewal agreement. The Deferred maintenance revenue line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheets principally represents payments received in advance of maintenance services rendered. Revenue from professional service arrangements is recognized pursuant to the provisions of SOP 97 2, which in most cases is as the services are performed. Revenues from professional services that are sold as part of a software transaction are deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the life of the related software transaction. If it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed. Revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and VARs is recognized when all four of the SOP 97 2 revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software product to their customers. This is commonly referred to as the sell through method. Beginning July 1, 2004, a majority of sales of products to distributors, resellers and VARs incorporate the right to receive certain unspecified future software products and revenue from those contracts is therefore recognized on a ratable basis. We have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and have a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under such agreements. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed upon receipt of cash payment. Our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products. Such warranties are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. Under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements, we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on, among other things, allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. In most cases, in the event of an infringement claim, we retain the right to (i) procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product; (ii) replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be reasonably achieved, we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid. Such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. In most cases and where legally enforceable, the indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer. Accounts Receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for the potential impairment of accounts receivable on the balance sheet. In developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts, we rely on several factors, including: Historical information, such as general collection history of multi year software agreements; Current customer information/events, such as extended delinquency, requests for restructuring, and filing for bankruptcy; Results of analyzing historical and current data; and The overall macroeconomic environment. The allowance is comprised of two components: (a) specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when, based on current information, we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer; and (b) an allowance for losses inherent in the remaining receivable portfolio based on the analysis of the specifically reviewed receivables. We expect the allowance for doubtful accounts to continue to decline as net installment accounts receivable under the prior business model are billed and collected. Under our Business Model, amounts due from customers are offset by deferred subscription revenue (unearned revenue) related to these amounts, resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet. Therefore, a smaller allowance for doubtful accounts is required. 33 Table of Contents Income Taxes When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction; estimate differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement purposes versus tax return purposes (known as temporary differences), which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities; and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets and net operating losses will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We have recognized as a deferred tax asset a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations. As of March 31, 2005, our gross deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance, totaled $379 million. Realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized. The factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets result from acquisition expenses, such as duplicate facility costs, employee severance and other costs that are not deductible until paid, net operating losses (NOLs) and temporary differences between the taxable cash payments received from customers and the ratable recognition of revenue in accordance with GAAP. The NOLs expire between 2006 and 2016. An additional valuation allowance of $34 million ($28 million from acquired NOLs) was established in fiscal year 2005 for certain NOLs and other deferred tax assets we believe might not be realized. Future results may vary from these estimates. At this time it is not practicable to determine if we will need to increase the valuation allowance or if such future valuations will have a material impact on our financial statements. Goodwill, Capitalized Software Products, and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill. Absent any prior indicators of impairment, we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We performed our annual assessment for fiscal year 2005 and concluded that there were no impairments to record. The SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model is a two step process. The first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test, and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test, is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions. These estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management. This approach uses significant assumptions, including projected future cash flow, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flow, and a terminal growth rate. The carrying value of capitalized software products, both purchased software and internally developed software, and other intangible assets, are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of internal and external facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of cost for other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date. It is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or, if such an impairment were to occur, the magnitude thereof. 34 Table of Contents Product Development and Enhancements We account for product development and enhancements in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates. If other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility, the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been impacted. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation We currently maintain stock based compensation plans. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain stock based awards. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk free interest rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years. Legal Contingencies We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability of a loss and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims, and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material legal proceedings. New Accounting Pronouncements In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law. This act introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision), provided that certain criteria are met. In addition, on December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP FAS 109 2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. The Company expects to repatriate approximately $500 million of cash under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 during fiscal year 2006 and has therefore accrued a $55 million or $0.09 per share tax charge in fiscal year 2005. We received a benefit of approximately $35 million or $0.06 per share in the quarter ending June 30, 2005 reflecting the Department of Treasury and IRS Notice 2005 38 issued on May 10, 2005 which will substantially reduce the taxes associated with the repatriation. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the Companys second quarter of fiscal year 2006. The Company does not believe that adopting of SFAS No. 153 will have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as that term is used in FASB No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. It also clarifies when an entity has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company is not required to begin applying the provisions of FIN 47 until fiscal year 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the pronouncements requirements on its financial statements. Risk Factors Current and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, or others, many of which are beyond our control, could negatively affect our revenue, profitability, and cash flow. 35 Table of Contents Our operating results and revenue are subject to fluctuations caused by many economic factors associated with our industry and the markets for our products which, in turn, may individually and collectively affect our revenue, profitability and cash flow in adverse and unpredictable ways. Quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a number of factors, associated with our industry and the markets for our products, including those listed below, which in turn could adversely affect our revenue, profitability, and cash flow in the future. Timing and impact of threat outbreaks (e.g. worms and viruses); The rate of adoption of new product technologies and releases of new operating systems; Demand for products and services; Length of sales cycle; Customer implementation of our products; Magnitude of price and product and or services competition; Introduction of new hardware; General economic conditions in countries in which customers do a substantial amount of business; Customer budgets for hardware, software and services; Ability to develop and introduce new or enhanced versions of our products; Changes in foreign currency exchange rates; Ability to control costs; The size of licensing transactions; Reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces; The results of litigation, including the government and internal investigations; Ability to retain and attract qualified personnel; and Reaction of customers to our Business Model. Any of the foregoing factors, among others, may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high, or cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate. As a consequence, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow could be adversely affected. Because we have significant international operations that are affected by economic and market conditions as well as intracompany decisions and capabilities, our sales and revenue may be affected in unpredictable ways. International revenue has historically represented a significant percentage of our total worldwide revenue. Continued success in selling our products outside the United States will depend on a variety of market and business factors, including: Reorganizations of the sales and technical services forces; Fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates; Staffing key managerial positions; The ability to successfully localize software products for a significant number of international markets; General economic conditions in foreign countries; Political stability; Trade restrictions such as tariffs, duties, or other controls affecting foreign operations; and Any of the foregoing factors, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. We have entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York (USAO) and a Final Consent Judgment with the SEC and if we violate either agreement we may be subject to, among other things, criminal prosecution or civil penalties which could adversely affect our credit ratings, stock price, ability to attract or retain employees and, therefore, our sales, revenue and client base. Our agreements with the USAO and the SEC resolve their investigations into certain of our past accounting practices, including our revenue recognition policies and procedures, and obstruction of their investigations provided we comply with certain continuing requirements under these agreements. We describe some of these requirements below. (For more information about our agreements with the USAO and the SEC, refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies of the Consolidated Financial Statements as well as our Current Report on Form 8 K filed September 22, 2004.) 36 Table of Contents The DPA If it is determined that we: deliberately gave false, incomplete or misleading information pursuant to the DPA; have committed any federal crimes subsequent to the DPA; or otherwise knowingly, intentionally, and materially violated any provision of the DPA, we shall be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which the USAO has knowledge. Any such prosecution may be based on information we have provided to the USAO, the SEC and other governmental agencies in connection with our cooperation under the DPA. This would include information provided because of our entry into the DPA that otherwise may not have been available to the USAO or may otherwise have been subject to privilege. Our continued cooperation with the USAO, the SEC, and our newly appointed Independent Examiner (see below) pursuant to the DPA and Consent Judgment may lead to the discovery of additional information regarding the conduct of the Company, including members of former management in prior periods. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of any such information on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. The Final Consent Judgment with the SEC (the Consent Judgment) Pursuant to the Consent Judgment, we are enjoined from violating a number of provisions of the federal securities laws. Any further violation of these laws could result in civil remedies, including sanctions, fines and penalties, which may be far more severe than if the violation had occurred without the Consent Judgment being in place. Additionally, if we breach the terms of the Consent Judgment, the SEC may petition the Court to vacate the Consent Judgment and restore the SECs original action to the active docket for all purposes. If the action were restored, the SEC could use information in the action that we have provided to the USAO, the SEC, and other governmental agencies in connection with our cooperation under the Consent Judgment. This would include information provided because of our entry into the Consent Judgment that otherwise may not have been available to the SEC or may otherwise have been subject to privilege. General Under both the DPA and the Consent Judgment, we are obligated to undertake a number of internal reforms including but not limited to: adding new management and independent directors; establishing a Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and an executive disclosure committee; establishing new comprehensive records management policies; taking steps to implement best practices regarding recognition of software license revenue; establishing a comprehensive compliance and ethics program; reorganizing our Finance and Internal Audit Departments; establishing a plan to improve communication with government agencies engaged in inquiries or investigations relating to the Company; enhancing our current hotline for employees to report potential violations of the law or other misconduct; and agreeing to the appointment of an Independent Examiner, who will serve a term of 18 months (subject to extension by the USAO and the SEC), and will examine and issue reports on our practices to the USAO, the SEC, and our Board of Directors beginning no later than September 2005 and quarterly thereafter. In the short term, we cannot predict what impact, if any, the adoption of these reforms (including the upcoming reports of the Independent Examiner) may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow and they may result in the diversion of management attention and employee resources from core business functions or opportunities. If it were determined that we breached the terms of the DPA or Consent Judgment, we cannot predict the scope, timing, or outcome of the actions that would be taken by the USAO or the SEC. These actions could include the institution of administrative, civil injunctive, or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, which may be significant, suspensions or debarments from government product and or services contracts, and other remedies and sanctions, any of which could lead to an adverse impact on our credit ratings and ability to obtain financing, an adverse impact on our stock price, loss of additional senior management, the inability to attract or retain key employees, and the loss of customers. In addition, under the law, the illegal acts of our employees may be ascribed to us. We cannot predict what impact, if any, these matters may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. Moreover, under both the DPA and Consent Judgment, we are obligated to cooperate with the government in its ongoing investigations of past conduct. While we do not anticipate any further material adjustments to our financial statements for completed periods, the processes described above have not been fully completed, and we may be required to take additional remedial measures. If we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations, including the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, requires effective planning and management system and process. We will need to continue to improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future. As a result, we have recently licensed enterprise resource planning software from SAP AG and have begun a process to expand and upgrade our operational and financial systems. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to our new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand, manage our supply chain, achieve accuracy in the conversion 37 Table of Contents of electronic data and records, report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis, and could potentially constitute a breach of the terms of the DPA. In addition, as we add additional functionality, new problems could arise that we have not foreseen. Such problems could adversely impact our ability to do the following in a timely manner: provide quotes; take customer orders; ship products; provide services and support to our customers; bill and track our customers; fulfill contractual obligations; and otherwise run our business. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in the diversion of managements attention and resources, impact our ability to manage our business and our results of operations, cash flows, and our stock price could be negatively impacted. We may encounter difficulties in successfully integrating companies and products that we have acquired or may acquire into our existing business and, therefore, such failed integration may adversely affect our infrastructure, market presence, results of operations and stock price. We have in the past and expect in the future to acquire complementary companies, products, services and technologies. The risks we may encounter include: we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further improve our financial and strategic position as planned; we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business; we may have difficulty retaining the technical skills needed to provide services on the acquired products; we may have difficulty incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines; we may have product liability, customer liability or intellectual property liability associated with the sale of the acquired companys products; our ongoing business may be disrupted by transition or integration issues; our managements attention may be diverted from other business concerns; we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from governmental authorities under applicable competition and antitrust laws; we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; our relationships with current and new employees, customers and distributors could be impaired; the acquisition may result in increased litigation risk including litigation from terminated employees or third parties; and our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the target companys product quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices, internal control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, product architecture, legal contingencies and other matters. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a large acquisition or number of acquisitions. To the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock, including options, to pay for acquisitions, existing stockholders interests may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. We are subject to intense competition in product and service offerings and pricing, and we expect to face increased competition in the future, which could hinder our ability to attract and retain employees and diminish demand for our products and, therefore, reduce our sales, revenue and market presence. The markets for our products are intensely competitive, and we expect product and service offerings and pricing competition to increase. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger technical staffs, established relationships with hardware vendors, and or greater financial, technical, and marketing resources. Competitors for our various products include large technology companies. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies and shareware authors that may develop competing products. The competition may affect our ability to attract and retain the technical skills needed to provide services to our customers, forcing us to become more reliant on delivery of services through third parties. This, in turn, could increase operating costs and decrease our revenue, profitability and cash flow. Our competitors include large vendors of hardware or operating system software. The widespread inclusion of products that perform the same or similar functions as our products within computer hardware or other companies software products could reduce the perceived need for our products and services, or render our products obsolete and unmarketable. Furthermore, even if these incorporated products are inferior or more limited than our products, customers may elect to accept the incorporated products rather than purchase our products. In addition, the software industry is currently undergoing consolidation as software companies seek to offer more extensive suites and broader arrays of software products, as well as integrated software and hardware solutions. This consolidation may negatively impact our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Refer to Item 1, Business Competition, for additional information. Certain software that we use in daily operations is licensed from third parties and thus may not be available to us in the future, which has the potential to delay product development and production and, therefore, decrease revenues and profits. Some of our products contain software licensed from third parties. Some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the ability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or enhancement of existing products. We may also choose to pay a premium price for such a license in certain 38 Table of Contents circumstances where continuity of the product would outweigh the premium cost of the license. We do not consider the revenue from products using software licensed from third parties to be material. However, there can be no assurance that at a given point of time, any of the above will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Certain software we use is from open source code sources which under certain circumstances may lead to increased costs and, therefore, decreased cash flow. Some of our products contain software from open source code sources. The use of such open source code may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer our products that use open source code for no cost. We monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend. However, the use of such open source code may ultimately subject some product(s) to unintended conditions so that we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts. We believe that the use of such open source code will not have a significant impact on our operations and that our products will be viable after any remediation efforts. However, there can be no assurance that future conditions involving such open source code will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. If our products do not remain compatible with ever changing operating environments we could lose customers and the demand for our products and services could decrease, which would negatively impact sales and revenue. IBM, HP, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft are the largest suppliers of systems and computing software and, in most cases, are the manufacturers of the computer hardware systems used by most of our customers. Historically, these operating system developers have modified or introduced new operating systems, systems software, and computer hardware. Such new products could, in the future, incorporate features that perform functions currently performed by our products, or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies hardware or software. Although we have to date been able to adapt our products and our business to changes introduced by hardware manufacturers and system software developers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. Failure to adapt our products in a timely manner to such changes or customer decisions to forego the use of our products in favor of those with comparable functionality contained either in the hardware or operating system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Failure to timely adapt to technological change could adversely affect our revenues and earnings. If we fail to keep pace with technological change in our industry, such failure would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. We operate in a highly competitive industry characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. During the past several years, many new technological advancements and competing products entered the marketplace. The distributed systems and application management markets in which we operate are far more crowded and competitive than our traditional mainframe systems management markets. Our ability to compete effectively and our growth prospects depend upon many factors, including the success of our existing distributed systems products, the timely introduction and success of future software products, and the ability of our products to interoperate and perform well with existing and future leading databases and other platforms supported by our products. We have experienced long development cycles and product delays in the past, particularly with some of our distributed systems products, and expect to have delays in the future. Delays in new product introductions or less than anticipated market acceptance of these new products are possible and would have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings. 39 Table of Contents Discovery of errors in our software could adversely affect our revenues and earnings and subject us to product liability claims, which may be costly and time consuming. The software products we offer are inherently complex. Despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions, new versions, or enhancements of our products after commencement of commercial shipments. If new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support, our operating margins could be adversely affected. Moreover, we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations. Significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases. These combinations increase our risk further because in the event of a system wide failure, it may be difficult to determine which product is at fault; thus, we may be harmed by the failure of another suppliers products. As a result of the foregoing, we could experience: Loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share; Loss of customers, including the inability to do repeat business with existing key customers; Damage to our reputation; Failure to achieve market acceptance; Diversion of development resources; Increased service and warranty costs; Legal actions by customers against us which could, whether or not successful, increase costs and distract our management; Increased insurance costs; and Failure to successfully complete service engagements for product installations and implementations. In addition, a product liability claim, whether or not successful, could be time consuming and costly and thus could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations or financial positions. Our credit ratings have been downgraded and could be downgraded further which would require us to pay additional interest under our credit agreement and could adversely affect our ability to borrow. Our credit ratings from Moodys Investor Service and Standard Poors were downgraded in 2003. In March 2004, Moodys again lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to Ba1, which is below investment grade, and our short term rating for commercial paper to Not Prime. In April 2004, SP lowered our senior unsecured debt rating to BBB and our short term rating for commercial paper to A 3. SP has placed us on negative outlook. In November 2004, Fitch Ratings initiated rating of our long term and short term debt and rated our senior unsecured notes BBB . Moodys, SP, or any other credit rating agency may further downgrade or take other negative action with respect to our credit ratings in the future. If our credit ratings are further downgraded or other negative action is taken, we would be required to, among other things, pay additional interest under our credit agreements. Any downgrades could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. We have a significant amount of debt and failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. As of March 31, 2005, we had approximately $2.6 billion of debt outstanding, consisting of unsecured fixed rate senior note obligations, convertible senior notes, and unsecured multicurrency credit facilities. Refer to Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Contractual Obligations and Commitments for the payment schedule of our long term debt obligations, inclusive of interest. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided from operations, and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights would weaken our competitive position. Our future success is highly dependent upon our proprietary technology, including our software. Failure to protect such technology could lead to our loss of valuable assets and competitive advantage. We protect our proprietary information through the use of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, policing unauthorized use or copying of our proprietary information is difficult. Unauthorized use or copying occurs from time to time and litigation to enforce intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and diversion of resources. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not afford the same degree of protection to our proprietary rights as do the laws of the United States. For 40 Table of Contents example, we rely on shrink wrap or click on licenses which may be unenforceable in whole or in part in some jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, patents we have obtained may be circumvented, challenged, invalidated, or designed around by other companies. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property for these or other reasons could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Refer to Item 1, Business Proprietary Rights, for additional information. We may become dependent upon large transactions and the failure to close such transactions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. We have historically been dependent upon large dollar enterprise transactions with individual customers. As a result of the flexibility afforded by our Business Model, we anticipate that there will be fewer of these transactions in the future. There can be no assurances, however, that we will not be reliant on large dollar enterprise transactions in the future, and the failure to close such transactions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Our customers data centers and IT environments may be subject to hacking or other breaches harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our products. If an actual or perceived breach of our customers network security occurs, allowing access to our customers data centers or other parts of their IT environments, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources from development efforts. Additionally, these efforts could cause interruptions, modifications, delays or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers adversely affecting our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Our software products, data centers and IT environments may be subject to hacking or other breaches harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our products. Although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions, we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products. Similarly, experienced computer programmers, or hackers, may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our data centers and IT environments and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services. If these intentionally disruptive efforts are successful, our activities could be adversely affected, our reputation and future sales could be harmed, and our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow could be adversely affected. General economic conditions may lead our customers to delay or forgo technology upgrades which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Our products are designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of our customers information processing resources. However, a general slowdown in the world economy or a particular region could cause customers to delay or forgo decisions to license new products, to upgrade their existing environments, or to acquire services, particularly with respect to discretionary spending in the software industry, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. The use of third party microcode could negatively impact our product development. We anticipate ongoing use of microcode or firmware provided by hardware manufacturers. Microcode and firmware are essentially software programs in hardware form and are, therefore, less flexible than other types of software. We believe that such continued use will not have a significant impact on our operations and that our products will remain compatible with any changes to such code. However, there can be no assurance that future technological developments involving such microcode will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. The software business is marked by easy entry and large, entrenched businesses which may lead to increased competition and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Many companies with whom we compete, including IBM, Sun Microsystems, HP, and other large computer manufacturers, have substantial resources, a larger installed base of customers in any particular market niche, as well as the ability to develop and market software programs similar to and competitive with the products offered by us. Additionally, these producers can bundle hardware, software, and services together, which is a disadvantage for us since we do not provide hardware and have far fewer services offerings. Competitive products are also offered by numerous independent software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry. Some, like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP, are the leading developers and vendors in their specialized markets. In addition, new 41 Table of Contents companies enter the market on a frequent and regular basis, offering products that compete with those offered by us. Increased competition also results from consolidation of existing companies within the industry. Additionally, many customers historically have developed their own products that compete with those offered by us. Competition from any of these sources can result in price reductions or displacement of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. We may lose access to third party operating systems which would adversely affect future product development. In the past, certain of our licensees using proprietary operating systems were furnished with source code, which makes the operating system understandable to programmers; object code, which directly controls the hardware; and other technical documentation. Since the availability of source code facilitated the development of systems and applications software, which must interface with the operating systems, independent software vendors, such as us, were able to develop and market compatible software. Microsoft, IBM, and other vendors have a policy of restricting the use or availability of the source code for some of their operating systems. To date, this policy has not had a material effect on us. Some companies, however, may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access. These restrictions may, in the future, result in higher research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products. Although we do not expect that such restrictions will have this adverse effect, there can be no assurances that such restrictions or other restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. The markets for some or all of our key product areas may not grow. As announced in April 2005, our products will be aligned by software business unit. Our business units will consist of Enterprise Systems Management, Security Management, Storage Management, Business Service Optimization (BSO), and the CA Products Group which will encompass solutions from a number of CA brands that fall outside of our core areas of systems and security management. Some or all of these areas may not grow, may decline in growth, or customers may decline or forgo use of products in some or all of these product areas. This is particularly true in newly emerging areas. A decline in these product areas could result in decreased demand for our products and services, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Third parties could claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights which could result in significant litigation expense or settlement with unfavorable terms that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. From time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement of various forms of their intellectual property. Investigation of these claims, whether with or without merit, can be expensive and could affect development, marketing, or shipment of our products. As the number of software patents issued increases, it is likely that additional claims, which with or without merit, will be asserted. Defending against such claims is time consuming and could result in significant litigation expense or settlement with unfavorable terms that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Fluctuations in foreign currencies could result in transaction losses. Most of the revenue and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies. Given the relatively long sales cycle that is typical for many of our products, foreign currency fluctuations could result in substantial changes in the foreign currency impact on these transactions. Additionally, fluctuations of the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar can affect our revenue within those markets, all of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. Our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations. Our stock price is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results, the gain or loss of significant license agreements, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, announcements related to our past accounting issues, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, changes in domestic and international economic and business conditions, general conditions in the software and computer industries, and other events or factors. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries that are similar or related to those in which we operate and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These market fluctuations have in the past adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which in turn could affect the value of our stock based compensation and our ability to retain and attract key employees. 42 Table of Contents Taxation of extraterritorial income could adversely affect our results. In August 2001, a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000 (ETI) constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The U.S. government appealed the panels decision and lost its appeal. On March 1, 2004, the European Union began imposing retaliatory tariffs on a specified list of U.S.source goods. In order to comply with international trade rules the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) repealed the current tax treatment for ETI. The Act replaces the ETI provisions with a domestic manufacturing deduction and includes transition provisions for the ETI phase out. We are reviewing the provisions of the Act and the impact on our effective tax rate. Although the WTO has not challenged the Act, it remains possible that the WTO may once again challenge the new tax benefits as being an illegal export subsidy. Other potential tax liabilities may adversely affect our results. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods in which that determination is made could result. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, debt, and installment accounts receivable. We have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of government agencies, such as municipal bonds, and high quality corporate issuers (Standard Poors single A rating and higher). To mitigate risk, many of the securities have a maturity date within one year, and holdings of any one issuer, excluding the U.S. government, do not exceed 10% of the portfolio. Periodically, the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. We have shifted from a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments to substantially all fixed rate debt instruments to take advantage of historically low interest rates. As of March 31, 2005, our outstanding debt approximated $2.6 billion, approximately all of which is in fixed rate obligations. If market rates were to decline, we could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates. Each 25 basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $7 million. Each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an immaterial annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of March 31, 2005. We offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our software license agreements. The aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element, which can vary with the interest rate environment. Each 25 basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $12 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business on a worldwide basis through branches and subsidiaries in 47 countries outside the United States. We are therefore exposed to movement in currency exchange rates. As part of our risk management strategy and consistent with prior years, we did not enter into any foreign exchange derivative transactions. In addition, we manage our level of exposure by denominating a majority of international sales and payments of related expense in the local currencies of our subsidiaries. A 1% change in all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would have an insignificant effect on our results from operations. Equity Price Risk As of March 31, 2005, we have minimal investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies. These investments were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or temporary losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity. It is not customary for us to make investments in equity securities as part of our investment strategy. 43 Table of Contents
