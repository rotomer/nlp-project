Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity, and results of operations. The information below has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of the Companys financial results which is more fully described in the Explanatory Note Restatements immediately preceding Part I of this Form 10 K and in Note 12, Restatements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Overview We are one of the worlds largest providers of IT management software. Our software and expertise enables customers to better manage their complex IT infrastructures across systems and networks, security and storage solutions. Our technology solutions are comprehensive, integrated, real time and open. They are not tied to any one platform, but instead make it possible for customers to manage all of the computers, networks and other technologies that comprise their computing environments. In turn, this helps customers better manage the investments they have made in IT rather than having to rip and replace them. As a result, customers gain flexibility. They can manage risk, manage cost, increase service and better align their IT investments with the needs of their organization. We pursue a number of high growth areas with our products, including network and systems management, security and storage. Our solutions are designed for both mainframe and distributed environments, each of which comprise about half of our revenue. The CA Business Model As described in greater detail in Item 1, Business, of the Companys Form 10 K, we license our software products directly to customers as well as through distributors, resellers, and VARs. We generate revenue from the following sources: license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis; maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements; and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation, consulting, and education services. The timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a reporting period are determined individually by license agreement, based on its duration and specific terms. Under our business model, we provide customers with the flexibility to license software under month to month licenses or to fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements. We also permit customers to change their software mix as their business and technology needs change, which includes the right to receive software in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee, commonly referred to as unspecified future upgrades. As a result of the right our customers have to receive unspecified future upgrades, as well as maintenance included during the term of the license, we are required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States 29 Table of Contents of America (GAAP) to recognize revenue from our license agreements evenly on a monthly basis (also known as ratably) over the license term. We believe recognizing license revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement more accurately reflects the earnings process; we also believe that it improves the predictability of our reported revenue streams. Under agreements entered into prior to October 2000 (the prior business model), and as is common practice in the software industry, we did not offer our customers the right to receive unspecified future upgrades. As a result, for most license agreements entered into prior to October 2000, we were required under GAAP to record the present value of the license agreement as revenue at the time the license agreement was signed. Under our business model, the portion of the contract value that has not yet been recognized creates what we refer to as deferred subscription value. Deferred subscription value is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the license agreements. When recognized, this revenue is reported on the Subscription revenue line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue, the amount deferred is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Not all of our active customer contracts have been transitioned to our business model, which has created what we refer to as a Transition Period, during which the license agreements under our prior business model come up for renewal. During this Transition Period, as customer license agreements under our prior business model are renewed under our business model, we are building deferred subscription value related to that customer, from which subscription revenue will be amortized in future periods. Total deferred subscription value, and the associated subscription revenue that comes out of it, may increase over time as we continue to renew customer contracts that were executed under the prior business model, transition acquired company contracts to our business model, sell additional products and capacity to existing customers, and enter into new contracts with new customers. The favorable impact on subscription revenue from the conversion of contracts from our old business model to our new business model will decrease over time as the transition is completed. The remaining balance of unbilled installment receivables that were previously recognized as revenue under our prior business model was $0.76 billion and $1.15 billion at March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005, respectively. While the impact of changing from up front revenue recognition under our prior business model to our current business model resulted in the postponement of the recognition of amounts that previously would have been recognized earlier under the up front model, we generally did not change our cost structure. Under both the prior business model and our current business model, customers often pay for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement. We refer to these payments as installment payments. While the transition to the current business model has changed the timing of revenue recognition, in most cases it has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers. As a result, our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the transition to the current business model over the past several years; and we do not expect in the future any significant changes in our cash generated from operations as a result of this transition. Significant Business Events The Government Investigation In fiscal year 2002, the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern Division of New York (USAO) and the staff of the Northeast Region of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commenced an investigation concerning certain of our past accounting practices, including our revenue recognition procedures in periods prior to the adoption of our business model in October 2000. In September 2004, we reached agreements with the USAO and the SEC by entering into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the USAO and consenting to the entry of a Final Consent Judgment (Consent Judgment) in a parallel proceeding brought by the SEC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the Federal Court). The Federal Court approved the DPA on September 22, 2004 and entered the Consent Judgment on September 28, 2004. The agreements resolved the USAO and SEC investigations into certain of our past accounting practices, including our revenue recognition policies and procedures, and obstruction of their investigations. 30 Table of Contents Under the DPA, we agreed to establish a $225 million fund for purposes of restitution to our current and former stockholders, with $75 million paid within 30 days of the date of approval of the DPA by the Court, $75 million to be paid within one year after the approval date and $75 million to be paid within 18 months after the approval date. We have made all three payments as of March 31, 2006. We have, among other things, taken the following actions: (1) added three new independent directors to the Board of Directors; (2) established a compliance committee of the Board of Directors by amending the charter of its Audit Committee and renaming it as the Audit and Compliance Committee; (3) appointed a Chief Compliance Officer and began implementation of an enhanced compliance and ethics program; (4) reorganized the Finance and Internal Audit Departments; (5) established an executive disclosure committee chaired by the our chief executive officer; and (6) enhanced our Hotline (now Helpline) and issued our Compliance and Helpline Policy. We issued a report on our progress under the DPA and Consent Judgment in the proxy statement filed with the SEC in July 2005. We will report on further progress under the DPA in our 2006 definitive proxy statement to be filed in August 2006. On March 16, 2005, pursuant to the DPA and Consent Judgment, the United States District Court issued an order appointing attorney Lee S. Richards III, Esq., of Richards Spears Kibbe & Orbe LLP, to serve as Independent Examiner. The Independent Examiner is reviewing our compliance with the DPA and Consent Judgment and issued his six month report concerning his recommendations regarding best practices on September 15, 2005. On December 15, 2005, March 15, 2006 and June 15, 2006, Mr. Richards issued his first three quarterly reports concerning our compliance with the DPA. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the government investigation. Internal Control Issues and Possible Extension of Independent Examiners Term of Appointment Under the DPA As described elsewhere in this Form 10 K, we are restating our financial results for prior fiscal periods as well as current and prior interim periods during fiscal years 2006 and 2005 because we did not properly recognize non cash stock based compensation expense, subscription revenue, or sales commission expense for certain periods. In addition, our outside auditors determined that we did not properly calculate our taxes for certain non routine tax matters in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and had to adjust them. As a result of these errors and other matters, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in Item 9A of this Form 10 K. Under the DPA, we are obligated, among other things, to take certain steps to improve internal controls and to reorganize our Finance Department. If we have not substantially implemented these and other required reforms for a period of at least two successive quarters before September 30, 2006, the USAO and the SEC may, in their discretion, extend the term of the Independent Examiner. In his Fourth Report dated June 15, 2006, the Independent Examiner expressed the view that, in light of certain internal control issues, which are described further in Item 9A of this Form 10 K, including the fact that we have not yet hired a new chief financial officer, he is no longer able to conclude that we will be able to meet our obligation under the DPA to have improved internal controls and reorganized the Finance Department for two successive quarters prior to September 30, 2006. Consequently, we believe that the term of the Independent Examiner may be extended beyond September 30, 2006. Whether the USAO and the SEC will decide to extend the term or take any other action in connection with the DPA will be made by them in their discretion. We are continuing to review these matters to determine what further steps we should take to address the internal control issues referenced above. On July 28, 2006, we announced that Nancy E. Cooper was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, reporting to our Chief Executive Officer. Her appointment is effective on or about August 15, 2006. Acquisitions and Divestitures In March 2006, we acquired the common stock of Wily Technology, Inc. (Wily), a provider of enterprise application management solutions, for a total purchase price of approximately $374 million, or approximately $361 million net of acquired cash and marketable securities. Wily is a provider of enterprise application management software solutions that enable companies to manage their web applications and infrastructure. The acquisition of Wily extends our application management offerings. 31 Table of Contents In December 2005, we acquired Control F 1 Corporation (Control F 1) for a total purchase price of approximately $14 million. Control F 1 was a privately held provider of support automation solutions that automatically prevent, detect and repair end user computer problems before they disrupt critical IT services. CA markets the Control F1 solutions as stand alone products and has incorporated them into our portfolio of Business Service Optimization solutions, which help customers reduce costs, improve service levels, and better align IT with the business. In December 2005, we sold our wholly owned subsidiary MultiGen Paradigm, Inc. (MultiGen) to Parallax Capital Partners. MultiGen was a provider of real time, end to end 3D solutions for visualizations, simulations and training applications used for both civilian and government purposes. As a result of the sale, we recognized a gain on the disposal of $3 million, net of taxes, which is classified in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In November 2005, we announced an agreement with Garnett & Helfrich Capital, a private equity firm, to create an independent corporate entity, Ingres Corporation. We divested our Ingres open source database unit into Ingres Corporation, in which Garnett & Helfrich Capital is the majority shareholder. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a non cash pre tax gain of approximately $7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006. In October 2005, we completed the acquisition of iLumin Software Services, Inc. (iLumin), a privately held provider of enterprise message management and archiving software, for a total purchase price of approximately $48 million. iLumins Assentor product line has been added to our BrightStor solutions. In July 2005, we acquired Niku Corporation (Niku), a provider of information technology management and governance solutions, for a total purchase price of approximately $345 million, or approximately $282 million net of acquired cash and marketable securities. Nikus primary software product, Clarity IT MG, is an integrated suite that spans and strengthens the IT governance offering of our Business Service Optimization business unit to the full IT life cycle, from investment selection, to execution and delivery of initiatives, to results assessment. In June 2005, we acquired Concord Communications, Inc. (Concord), a provider of network service management software solutions, for a total purchase price of approximately $359 million, or approximately $283 million net of acquired cash and marketable securities. Concord is a provider of infrastructure software principally in the areas of network health, performance, and fault management. We have made Concords eHealth and Spectrum software available both as independent products and as integrated components of our Unicenter product portfolio in our Enterprise Systems Management business unit. In connection with the acquisition, we assumed $86 million in 3% convertible senior notes due 2023. In accordance with the notes terms, we redeemed (for cash) the notes in full in July 2005. In November 2004, we completed the acquisition of Netegrity, Inc. (Netegrity), a provider of business security software solutions in the area of access and identity management, for a total purchase price of approximately $455 million, or approximately $358 million net of acquired cash and marketable securities. Netegrity was a provider of business security software, principally in the areas of identity and access management, and we have made Netegritys identity and access management solutions available both as independent products and as integrated components of our eTrust Identity and Access Management Suite in our Security Management business unit. In August 2004, we acquired PestPatrol, Inc. (PestPatrol), a privately held provider of anti spyware and security solutions, for a total purchase price of approximately $40 million. The products acquired in this transaction were integrated into our eTrust Threat Management software product portfolio in our Security Management business unit. This portfolio protects organizations from diverse Internet dangers such as viruses, spam, and inappropriate use of the Web by employees. In March 2004, we sold our approximate 90% interest in ACCPAC International, Inc. (ACCPAC). ACCPAC provided accounting, customer relationship management, human resources, warehouse management, manufacturing, electronic data interchange, and point of sale software for small and medium sized businesses. Our net proceeds totaled $104 million for all of our outstanding equity interests in ACCPAC, including options and change of control payments for certain ACCPAC officers and managers. We received approximately $90 million of the net proceeds in fiscal year 2004 and the remainder in fiscal year 2005. As a result of the sale, we realized a gain, net of taxes, of approximately $60 million in fiscal year 2004. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we recorded 32 Table of Contents an adjustment to the gain of $2 million, net of tax, reducing the net gain to $58 million. The sale completed our multi year effort to exit the business applications market. Performance Indicators Management uses several quantitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition. Each provides a measurement of the performance of our business model and how well we are executing our plan. Our subscription based business model is unique among our competitors in the software industry and particularly during the Transition Period it is difficult to compare our results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors. The following is a summary of the principal quantitative performance indicators that management uses to review performance: Percent For the Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 Change Change (restated) (in millions) Subscription revenue $ 2,838 $ 2,587 $ 251 10 % Total revenue $ 3,796 $ 3,603 $ 193 5 % Subscription revenue as a percent of total revenue 75 % 72 % 3 % N/A Deferred subscription value $ 5,415 $ 5,486 $ (71 ) (1 ) % New deferred subscription value (direct) $ 2,610 $ 3,493 $ (883 ) (25 ) % New deferred subscription value (indirect) $ 195 $ 144 $ 51 35 % Weighted average license agreement duration in years (direct) 3.03 3.10 (.07 ) (2 ) % Cash from continuing operating activities 1,380 1,527 $ (147 ) (10 ) % Income from continuing operations 156 26 $ 130 500 % Percent As of March 31, 2006 2005 Change Change (in millions) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 1,865 $ 3,125 $ (1,260 ) (40 )% Total debt $ 1,811 $ 2,636 $ (825 ) (31 )% Analyses of our performance indicators, including general trends, can be found in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MD&A. The performance indicators discussed below are those that we believe are unique because of our subscription based business model. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue is the ratable revenue recognized in a period from amounts previously recorded as deferred subscription value. If the weighted average life of our license agreements remains constant, an increase in deferred subscription value will result in an increase in subscription revenue. Deferred Subscription Value Under our business model, the portion of the license contract value that has not yet been earned creates what we refer to as deferred subscription value. As revenue is ratably recognized (evenly on a monthly basis), it is reported as Subscription Revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the deferred subscription value attributable to that contract is correspondingly reduced. When recognized as revenue, the amount is reported on the Subscription revenue line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue, the amount is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers do not always pay for software in equal annual installments over the life of a license agreement. The amount collected under a license agreement for the next twelve months but not yet recognized as revenue is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount paid under a license agreement for periods subsequent to the next twelve months, which will be recognized as revenue on a monthly basis only in those future years, is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) noncurrent on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase or decrease in current payments attributable to periods subsequent to the next twelve months is reported as an operating activity entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) noncurrent in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 33 Table of Contents Payments received in the current period that are attributable to later years of a license agreement have a positive impact in the current period on billings and cash provided by continuing operating activities. Accordingly, to the extent such payments are attributable to the later years of a license agreement, the license would provide a correspondingly reduced contribution to billings and cash from operating activities during the licenses later years. New Deferred Subscription Value New deferred subscription value represents the total incremental value (contract value) of software licenses sold in a period, which will be accounted for under our subscription model of revenue recognition. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we began offering more flexible license terms to our channel partners end users, necessitating ratable recognition of revenue for the majority of our indirect business. Prior to July 1, 2004, such channel license revenue had been recorded up front on a sell through basis (when a distributor, reseller, or VAR sells the software product to its customers) and reported on the Software fees and other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. New deferred subscription value excludes the value associated with single year maintenance only license agreements, license only indirect sales, and professional services arrangements and does not include that portion of bundled maintenance or unamortized discounts that are converted into subscription revenue upon renewal of prior business model contracts. New deferred subscription value is what we expect to collect over time from our customers based upon contractual license agreements entered into during a reporting period. This amount is recognized as subscription revenue ratably over the applicable software license term. The license agreements that contribute to new deferred subscription value represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods generally up to three years. Our new deferred subscription value typically increases in each consecutive fiscal quarter, with the fourth quarter being the strongest. However, since new deferred subscription value is impacted by the volume and dollar amount of contracts coming up for renewal and the amount of early contract renewals, the change in new deferred subscription value, relative to previous periods, does not necessarily correlate to the change in billings or cash receipts, relative to previous periods. The contribution to current period revenue from new deferred subscription value from any single license agreement is relatively small, since revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable license agreement term. Weighted Average License Agreement Duration in Years The weighted average license agreement duration in years reflects the duration of all software licenses executed during a period, weighted to reflect the contract value of each individual software license. The weighted average duration is impacted by the volume and dollar amount of contracts coming up for renewal, and therefore may change from period to period and will not necessarily correlate to the prior year periods. The annual weighted average duration of 3.03 and 3.10 years for the fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively, were derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts and quarterly weighted average durations in years from our direct business: Fiscal Year 2006 Fiscal Year 2005 New Deferred Weighted New Deferred Weighted Subscription Average Subscription Average Value from Duration Value from Duration in Direct Sales in Years Direct Sales Years (in millions) Fourth Quarter $ 969 2.89 $ 1,469 3.40 Third Quarter 730 3.46 845 2.95 Second Quarter 575 2.92 649 2.90 First Quarter 336 2.70 530 2.75 $ 2,610 3.03 $ 3,493 3.10 We believe license agreement durations averaging approximately three years increase the value customers receive from our software licenses by giving customers the flexibility to vary their software mix as their needs change. We also believe this flexibility improves our customer relationships and encourages greater accountability by us to each of our customers. The increase in the weighted average durations for contracts signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 is due to several individual longer term contracts signed during those quarters (e.g., four to five years). 34 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenue The following table presents the percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the revenue line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2006 Fiscal Year 2005 Percentage Percentage of of Percentage of Dollar Percentage of Dollar Total Change Total Change Revenue 2006/ Revenue 2005/ 2006 2005 2005 2005 2004 2004 (restated) (restated) (restated) Revenue: Subscription revenue 75 % 72 % 10 % 72 % 63 % 22 % Maintenance 11 % 12 % (2 )% 12 % 16 % (15 )% Software fees and other 4 % 7 % (36 )% 7 % 10 % (23 )% Financing fees 1 % 2 % (42 )% 2 % 4 % (43 )% Professional services 9 % 7 % 32 % 7 % 7 % 4 % Total revenue 100 % 100 % 5 % 100 % 100 % 8 % Total Revenue Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased $193 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, to $3.80 billion. This increase was partially a result of the transition to our business model, which contributed additional subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year as we continue to add incremental subscription revenue for contracts that are renewals of prior business model contracts for which revenue was previously recognized up front for multiple year licenses under our old business model. The increase in total revenue was also partially attributable to the sales of Concord, Niku, iLumin, and Wily products, which contributed approximately $125 million of separately identifiable revenue. It is expected that software fees and other revenue and maintenance revenue attributable to acquisitions will decline as these acquired products transition to our business model and revenue attributable to these acquired products is reported as subscription revenue. In addition, revenue for fiscal year 2006 was negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately $17 million compared with fiscal year 2005. Total revenue in fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005 was negatively impacted by decreases in maintenance and financing fees resulting from how these items are accounted for under our business model. The recognition of maintenance and financing fees under our business model is discussed further under Subscription Revenue in this MD&A. Our revenue was further negatively impacted by the fact that since the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, revenue from certain contracts in our channel business has been, and continues to be, recorded as new deferred subscription value, which will be ratably recognized into subscription revenue in future periods compared to prior periods when the majority of such revenue was recognized on an up front basis. Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased $271 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, to $3.60 billion. This increase was partially a result of the transition to our business model, which contributed additional subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year. The increase in total revenue was also partially attributable to the sales of Netegrity products which contributed approximately $32 million of revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2005. In addition, as our international contracts are denominated in local currencies, the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound, as well as certain other currencies, against the U.S. dollar increased our revenue by approximately $103 million. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue represents the portion of revenue ratably recognized on software license agreements entered into under our business model. Some of the licenses recorded between October 2000, when our business model was 35 Table of Contents implemented, and the end of fiscal year 2006 continued to contribute to subscription revenue on a monthly, ratable basis. As a result, subscription revenue for fiscal year 2006 includes ratably recognized revenue from contracts recorded in fiscal year 2006, as well as contracts recorded between October 2000 and the end of fiscal year 2005, depending on contract length. Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased $251 million from fiscal year 2005, to $2.84 billion. This increase was predominantly due to a $118 million increase in ratably recognized revenue from the indirect business plus the increase in subscription revenue as a result of renewals of contracts whose revenue was previously recognized on an up front basis or as part of maintenance fees under our prior business model. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, we added new deferred subscription value related to our direct business of $2.61 billion and $3.49 billion, respectively. The $0.88 billion decrease in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 in new deferred subscription value was primarily due to the decrease in early contract renewals resulting from the transition away from a total bookings based compensation structure. In addition, CA signed contract extensions with two customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 that added approximately $390 million in aggregate to new deferred subscription value in the period. We also recorded $195 million of new deferred subscription value for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 related to our indirect business, which increased 35% from the $144 million added in the prior fiscal year. Licenses executed under our business model for our direct business had weighted average durations of 3.03 years and 3.10 years, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Annualized new deferred subscription value represents the total value of all new software license agreements entered into during a period divided by the weighted average life of all such license agreements recorded during the same period. The annualized new deferred subscription value for the subscriptions booked in the direct business during the fiscal year 2006 decreased approximately $266 million, or 24% from the comparable prior fiscal year to approximately $861 million. Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased $474 million from fiscal year 2004, to $2.59 billion. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, we added new deferred subscription value related to our direct business of $3.49 billion and $2.29 billion, respectively. Licenses executed under our business model in the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 had weighted average durations of 3.1 and 2.8 years, respectively. Annualized deferred subscription value related to our direct business increased approximately $301 million, or 36%, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 over the comparable prior fiscal year to $1.13 billion. In addition, we recorded $144 million of new deferred subscription value for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 related to our indirect business. Subscription revenue was further increased as a result of renewals of contracts whose revenue was previously recognized on an up front basis or as part of maintenance fees under our prior business model. Under the prior business model, maintenance revenue was separately identified and was reported on the Maintenance line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under our business model, maintenance that is bundled with product sales is not separately identified in our customers license agreements and therefore is included within the Subscription revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under the prior business model, financing revenue was also separately identified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under our business model, financing fees are no longer applicable and the entire contract value is now recognized as subscription revenue over the term of the contract. The quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the increase in subscription revenue is not determinable. Maintenance Maintenance revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 decreased $11 million, or 3%, from the comparable prior year to $430 million. This decrease in maintenance revenue is a result of our transition to, and increased number of license agreements under, our business model, where maintenance revenue is bundled along with license revenue, and is reported on the Subscription revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The combined maintenance and license revenue on these types of license agreements is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement under our business model. We cannot quantify the impact that our transition to the new business model had on maintenance revenue since maintenance bundled with software licenses under our business model is not separately identifiable. Maintenance revenue from our indirect business declined $5 million 36 Table of Contents from the comparable prior period to $54 million. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $49 million associated with acquisitions completed prior to March 31, 2006. Maintenance revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased $79 million, or 15% from the prior year predominantly due to the transition of maintenance only licenses to subscription licenses, partially offset by a $36 million increase in maintenance revenue from the indirect business from the comparable prior period to $59 million. Software Fees and Other Software fees and other revenue consist of revenue related to distribution and OEM channel partners (sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue) that has been recorded on an up front sell through basis, revenue associated with acquisitions prior to the transition to our business model, revenue from joint ventures, royalty revenues and other revenue. Revenue related to acquisitions is initially recorded on the acquired companys systems generally under a perpetual or up front model, and is typically converted to our ratable model within the first fiscal year after the acquisition. As these contracts are renewed under our business model, revenue is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, software fees and other revenue decreased $92 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, to $162 million. This reduction is due to a $53 million decrease in prior business model revenue, as ratable revenue from new business model contracts was recorded as subscription revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, we experienced a decrease in indirect revenue associated with the transition to our subscription model in July 2004 which represented a $50 million reduction from the prior year as more revenue was deferred as these indirect contracts were renewed. These decreases were offset by other revenue increases of approximately $11 million. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, software fees and other revenue decreased $77 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, to $254 million. This reduction is due to the decrease in indirect revenue associated with the transition to our subscription model in July 2004 which represented a $128 million reduction from the prior year as more revenues were deferred as the contracts were renewed. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $21 million of license revenue associated with the sale of Netegrity products, an approximate $10 million benefit associated with the resolution of a prior business model contract dispute in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and approximately $20 million due to other activities. Financing Fees Financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under the prior business model, which required up front revenue recognition. This discount initially reduced the related installment accounts receivable and is referred to as Unamortized discounts. The related unamortized discount is amortized over the life of the applicable license agreement and is reported as financing fees. Under our business model, additional unamortized discounts are no longer recorded, since we no longer recognize revenue on an up front basis for sales of products with extended payment terms. As expected, for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, financing fees continued to decline, reflecting a decrease of $32 million and $57 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $45 million and $77 million, respectively. The decrease in financing fee revenue for both years is attributable to the discontinuance of offering license agreements under the prior business model and is expected to decline to zero over the next several years. Professional Services Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2006 increased $77 million from fiscal year 2005 to $321 million. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in professional service engagements relating to acquired companies of $23 million, growth in security software which utilize our Access Control and Identity Management solutions, growth in our IT Service and Asset Management engagements and project and portfolio management services. Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2005 increased $10 million from fiscal year 2004 to $244 million. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in security software engagements, which utilize Access Control and 37 Table of Contents Identity Management solutions, as well as growth in IT Service and Asset Management solutions. The increase was also partially attributable to approximately $4 million of services revenue associated with the sale of Netegrity products. This increase in services revenue was limited due to an increase in services sold in combination with related software products of approximately $14 million, which requires that such services revenue be recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period. Total Revenue by Geography The following table presents the amount of revenue earned from sales to unaffiliated customers in the United States and international regions and corresponding percentage changes for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2006 Fiscal Year 2005 2006 % 2005 % Change 2005 % 2004 % Change (restated) (restated) (restated) (in millions) United States $ 2,006 53 $ 1,878 52 7 % $ 1,878 52 $ 1,766 53 6 % International 1,790 47 1,725 48 4 % 1,725 48 1,566 47 10 % $ 3,796 100 $ 3,603 100 5 % $ 3,603 100 $ 3,332 100 8 % International revenue increased $65 million, or 4%, in fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005, primarily due to increased new deferred subscription value in prior periods associated with our European business partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately $17 million. The increase in revenue from the United States was primarily attributable to sales of products related to companies acquired during the fiscal year 2006, an increase in new deferred subscription value in prior periods as well as an increase in professional services revenue, partially offset by decreases in revenue from maintenance, finance fees and software fees and other revenues. International revenue increased $159 million, or 10%, in fiscal year 2005 as compared with fiscal year 2004. The increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to a positive impact to revenue from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $103 million for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004. The increase in foreign currency exchange is primarily associated with the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. The increase was also a result of an increase in contract bookings in prior periods associated with our European business. The increase in revenue from the United States was primarily attributable to an increase in contract booking in prior periods as well as an increase in professional services revenue. The increase was partially offset by decreases in revenue from maintenance, finance fees and software fees and other revenues. Price changes and inflation did not have a material impact in fiscal years 2006, 2005 or 2004. 38 Table of Contents Expenses The following table presents expenses as a percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the expense line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.

Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and internally generated capitalized software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software development costs are related to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage. Amortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 increased $2 million and decreased $16 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $449 million and $447 million, respectively. The increase in 2006 was predominantly due to the Companys current year acquisitions. The decrease in 2005 was primarily due to certain purchased software assets becoming fully amortized in 2005. We recorded amortization of purchased software products for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 of $401 million, $406 million, and $423 million, respectively. We recorded amortization of internally generated capitalized software development costs for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 of $48 million, $41 million, and $40 million, respectively. Cost of Professional Services Cost of professional services consists primarily of the personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2006 increased $42 million from fiscal year 2005 to $272 million, mostly due to increased sales of professional services. The 39 Table of Contents improvement in professional services gross margin from 6% in fiscal year 2005 to 15% in fiscal year 2006 is attributable to a more effective utilization of professional staff and increased professional services revenue. Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2005 increased $5 million from fiscal year 2004 to $230 million mostly due to increased revenue volume, partially offset by approximately $12 million of costs required to be deferred because they were sold in combination with related software products, which requires that the total estimated cost of such services be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period. Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2006 increased $244 million from fiscal year 2005 to $1.60 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to employee and other costs associated with the Concord, Niku, iLumin, and Wily acquisitions of approximately $98 million, increased travel, training and relocation costs of approximately $39 million, increased consulting costs of approximately $55 million related to our ERP implementation, legal fees, Sarbanes Oxley compliance programs, and increased marketing and promotion costs of approximately $35 million mostly due to our new branding campaign and channel promotions. Partly offsetting these increases was a reduction of $15 million associated with the Companys decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 to forego its discretionary contribution to the Company sponsored 401(k) plan. Through the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company had accrued $12 million, all of which was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, resulting in a $12 million reduction to SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. SG&A expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 included approximately $64 million and $60 million of stock based compensation expense, respectively. SG&A expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 included credits to the provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $18 million and $25 million, respectively. The credit in the provision for doubtful accounts is a result of the reduction in the prior business model accounts receivable. Under our business model, amounts due from customers are offset by related deferred subscription revenue, resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet. In addition, under our business model, customer payments are often received in advance of revenue recognition, which results in a reduced net credit exposure. Each of these items reduces the need to provide for estimated bad debts. SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2005 increased $35 million from fiscal year 2004 to $1.35 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs. SG&A expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 included approximately $60 million and $77 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense. In addition, in fiscal year 2005 we recorded a credit of approximately $25 million against the provision of doubtful accounts, which is lower than the credit of $53 million we recorded in fiscal year 2004. SG&A for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 also included approximately $24 million and $30 million, respectively, of legal expenses related to the government investigation and, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, included $31 million for consulting and other fees associated with our Sarbanes Oxley compliance program. Further, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, we realized a gain of approximately $8 million on the sale of an investment that was included in SG&A. Product Development and Enhancements For fiscal year 2006, product development and enhancement expenditures, which include product support, decreased $11 million compared to fiscal year 2005 to $697 million. Product development and enhancement expenditures were approximately 18% and 20% of total revenue for fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During fiscal year 2006, we continued to focus on and invest in product development and enhancements for emerging technologies such as wireless, Web services and on demand computing, as well as a broadening of our enterprise product offerings. Product development and enhancement expenditures for fiscal year 2005 increased $5 million from fiscal year 2004 to $708 million. Product development and enhancement expenditures were approximately 20% and 21% of total revenue for fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Commissions, Royalties and Bonuses Commissions, royalties and bonuses for fiscal year 2006 increased $55 million from fiscal year 2005 to $394 million. Sales commission expense increased approximately $36 million over the prior year, and was approximately $75 million more than the Company had anticipated at the outset of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. The increase was primarily due to a new sales commission plan for fiscal year 2006 that did not appropriately align commission payments with our overall performance. The impact of the higher sales commission expense was partially offset by lower bonus expenses in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 of approximately $8 million, primarily due to the reductions in our variable compensation programs, including management bonuses. Through the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company had accrued approximately $26 million in annual bonus expense, of which approximately $10 million was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2006. We are restating our third quarter results and have identified a material weakness in financial controls as they pertained to the fiscal year 2006 commissions plan. Refer to Part 1, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures for additional information concerning the evaluation of the Companys internal control processes over the recognition of commission expense. Royalties also increased over the prior year by approximately $25 million primarily due to an increased level of royalties associated with recent acquisitions, royalties associated with the newly formed Ingres Corporation as well as higher sales of certain royalty bearing channel products. Commissions, royalties and bonuses for fiscal year 2005 increased $72 million from fiscal year 2004 to $339 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in new deferred subscription value recorded in fiscal year 2005, on which sales commissions were based, as compared with fiscal year 2004. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal year 2006 increased $4 million from fiscal year 2005 to $134 million. The increase in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets acquired during the year, resulting from recent acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal year 2005 decreased $4 million from fiscal year 2004 to $130 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets from past acquisitions becoming fully amortized. Other (Gains)/Expenses, Net Gains and losses attributable to divestitures of fixed assets, certain foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and certain other infrequent events have been included in the Other (gains)/expenses, net line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The components of Other (gains)/expenses, net are as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Gains attributable to divestitures of fixed assets $ (7 ) $ $ (19 ) Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (9 ) 8 41 (Gains) expenses attributable to legal settlements 1 (13 ) 26 Impairment of capitalized software 4 Total $ (15 ) $ (5 ) $ 52 Restructuring and Other In the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we announced a restructuring plan designed to more closely align our investments with strategic growth opportunities, including a workforce reduction of approximately 5% or 800 positions worldwide. The plan is expected to yield about $75 million in savings on an annualized basis, once the reductions are fully implemented. We anticipate the total restructuring plan will cost up to $85 million. As of March 31, 2006, we have incurred approximately $66 million of expenses under the plan of which $45 million of these expenses remain unpaid at March 31, 2006. The remaining liability balance is included in Accrued expenses and other current 41 Table of Contents liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Final payment of these amounts is dependent upon settlement with the works councils in certain international locations and our ability to negotiate lease terminations. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we incurred approximately $15 million in connection with certain DPA related costs and the termination of a non core application development professional services project (see also Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and other expenses. In addition, as part of its restructuring initiatives and associated review of the benefits of owning versus leasing certain properties, the Company also entered into three sale/leaseback transactions during the second half of fiscal year 2006. Two of these transactions resulted in a loss totaling approximately $7 million which was recorded under Restructuring and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The third sale/leaseback transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $5 million which is being recognized ratably as a reduction to rent expense over the life of the lease term. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we announced a restructuring plan that was designed to more closely align our investments with strategic growth opportunities. The restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 5% or 750 positions worldwide, slightly lower than our original estimate of 800 positions. As of March 31, 2005, the Company had made all payments under the plan. Shareholder Litigation and Government Investigation Settlement In prior fiscal years, a number of stockholder class action lawsuits were initiated that alleged, among other things, that the Company made misleading statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in connection with the Companys financial performance. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the shareholder litigation. In August 2003, we announced the settlement of all outstanding litigation related to these actions. Under the settlement, we agreed to issue a total of up to 5.7 million shares of common stock to the shareholders represented in the three class action lawsuits, including payment of attorneys fees. In January 2004, approximately 1.6 million settlement shares were issued along with approximately $3.3 million to the plaintiffs attorneys for attorney fees and related expenses. In March 2004, approximately 0.2 million settlement shares were issued to participants and beneficiaries of the CASH Plan. On October 8, 2004, the Federal Court signed an order approving the distribution of the remaining 3.8 million settlement shares, less administrative expenses. All the remaining shareholder litigation settlement shares were issued in December 2004. Of the 3.8 million settlement shares, approximately 51,000 were used for the payment of administrative expenses in connection with the settlement, approximately 76,000 were liquidated for cash distributions to class members entitled to receive a cash distribution, and the remaining settlement shares were distributed to class members entitled to receive a distribution of shares. The final shareholder litigation settlement value of approximately $174 million was calculated using the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closing price of our common stock on December 14, 2004, the date the settlement shares were issued, and also included certain administrative costs associated with the settlement. An initial estimate for the value of the shareholder litigation settlement was established on August 22, 2003. The chart below summarizes the NYSE closing price of our common stock and the estimated value of the shareholder litigation settlement since the initial estimate was established. Shareholder NYSE Closing Litigation Settlement Stock Price Estimated Value (in millions) December 14, 2004 $ 31.03 $ 174 September 30, 2004 26.30 156 June 30, 2004 28.06 163 March 31, 2004 26.86 158 December 31, 2003 27.34 158 September 30, 2003 26.11 150 August 22, 2003 25.00 144 42 Table of Contents The shareholder litigation settlement expense for fiscal year 2005 of $16 million was a result of the increase in our stock price since March 31, 2004. The aggregate shareholder litigation settlement expense recorded was $174 million, including $158 million in fiscal year 2004. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In September 2004, we reached agreements with the USAO and the SEC in connection with their investigations of improper recognition of revenue and related reporting practices during the period January 1, 1998 through September 30, 2000, and the actions of certain former employees to impede the investigations. Under the DPA, we agreed, among other things, to establish a restitution fund of $225 million to compensate present and former Company shareholders for losses caused by the misconduct of certain former Company executives. In connection with the DPA, we recorded a $10 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 and $218 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 associated with the establishment of the shareholder restitution fund and related administrative fees. The first payment of $75 million was made during the third quarter of fiscal year 2005. The second payment of $75 million was made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and the final payment of $75 million was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net for fiscal year 2006 decreased $65 million as compared to fiscal year 2005 to $41 million. The change was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding which resulted in a $39 million decrease in interest expense, and a decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt, which resulted in a $20 million decrease in interest expense. The decrease was also due to an increase in our average cash balance and an increase in interest rates on the cash balance during the fiscal year ended 2006 as compared to the fiscal year ended 2005, which resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $6 million. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A and Note 6, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Interest expense, net for fiscal year 2005 decreased $11 million as compared to fiscal year 2004 to $106 million. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in our average cash balance during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, which resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $28 million. The decrease in interest expense was partially reduced by additional interest expense of $8 million incurred as a result of the issuance of the 2005 Senior Notes and an increase in the weighted average interest rate, which resulted in a $9 million increase in interest expense. Operating Margins Fiscal year 2006 pretax operating income from continuing operations was $121 million as compared to $33 million in fiscal year 2005. This improvement relates primarily to revenue growth as a result of our acquisitions, and $234 million in shareholder litigation and government investigation costs in fiscal year 2005 that did not recur in fiscal year 2006, partially offset by higher restructuring costs and higher selling, general and administrative costs and commission expenses incurred in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately (29%), 21%, and 23% for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Refer to Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The income tax benefit recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 includes benefits of approximately $51 million arising from the recognition of certain foreign tax credits, $18 million arising from international stock based compensation deductions and $66 million arising from foreign export benefits and other international tax rate benefits. Partially offsetting these benefits was a charge of approximately $46 million related to additional tax reserves. 43 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we repatriated approximately $584 million from foreign subsidiaries. Total taxes related to the repatriation were approximately $55 million. The repatriation was initially planned in fiscal year 2005 in response to the favorable tax benefits afforded by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), which introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, provided that certain criteria were met. During fiscal year 2005, we recorded an estimate of this tax charge of $55 million based on an estimated repatriation amount up to $500 million. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we recorded a benefit of approximately $36 million reflecting the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Notice 2005 38 issued on May 10, 2005. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company finalized its estimates of tax liabilities and determined that an adjustment was necessary and, accordingly, recorded an additional tax charge in the amount of $36 million. As a result of this complex tax matter, the Company has identified a material weakness in its internal controls over documenting and communicating tax planning strategies. See Item 9A, Controls and Procedures for additional information. In May 2004, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2004 34, Changes in Accounting Periods and in Methods of Accounting, which grants taxpayers a twelve month deferral for cash received from customers to the extent such receipts were not recognized in revenue for financial statement purposes. Therefore, taxes associated with cash collected from U.S. customers in advance of the ratable recognition of revenue for certain licenses are deferred for up to one year. As a result of implementing this revenue procedure, we reduced deferred tax assets and income taxes payable by approximately $73 million and $159 million as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes in fiscal year 2005 was approximately $12 million, which was lower than the amount we historically paid for incomes taxes primarily due to the new IRS revenue procedure. The income tax expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 includes a charge of $55 million reflecting the Companys original estimated cost of repatriating approximately $500 million under the AJCA which was partially offset by a $26 million tax benefit attributable to a refund claim originally made for additional tax benefits associated with prior fiscal years. We received a letter from the IRS approving the claim for this refund in September 2004. Selected Quarterly Information The information presented in the tables below has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of the Companys financial results which is more fully described in the Explanatory Note Restatements immediately preceding Part I of this Form 10 K and in Note 12, Restatements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(Refer to Income Taxes within Results of Operations). Also includes an after tax charge of approximately $3 million in connection with certain DPA related costs, an after tax charge of approximately $9 million for severance and other expenses in connection with a restructuring plan (refer to Shareholder Litigation and Government Investigation Settlement and Restructuring Charge within Results of Operations), a tax charge of approximately $2 million relating to the loss on a sale leaseback transaction, and after tax credits of approximately $1 million related to a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts (refer to Note 5, Trade and Installment Accounts Receivable, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), $6 million due to full year reductions in variable compensation programs, and $7 million due to the Companys decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 to forego its discretionary contribution to the company sponsored 401(k) plan. (5) Includes an after tax charge of approximately $130 million related to the shareholder litigation and government investigation settlements, an after tax charge of approximately $17 million for severance and other expenses in connection with a restructuring plan (refer to Shareholder Litigation and Government Investigation Settlement and Restructuring Charge within Results of Operations), and an after tax credit of approximately $3 million related to a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts (refer to Note 5, Trade and Installment Accounts Receivable, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (6) Includes an after tax charge of approximately $6 million of cash and stock based compensation expense associated with the appointment of our new President and CEO in November 2004 and an after tax credit of approximately $4 million related to a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts (refer to Note 5, Trade and Installment Accounts Receivable, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). (7) Includes a tax expense charge of $55 million related to the repatriation of $500 million in cash under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Refer to Income Taxes within Results of Operations), an after tax gain of approximately $10 million related to the settlement with Quest Software Inc., and an after tax credit of approximately $8 million related to a reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts (refer to Note 5, Trade and Installment Accounts Receivable, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 45 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash balances, including cash equivalents, are held in numerous locations throughout the world, and a substantial portion resides outside the United States. In fiscal year 2006, the Company repatriated approximately $584 million in cash to the United States in order to avail itself of the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The aggregate amount of taxes related to the repatriation was approximately $55 million. Sources and Uses of Cash Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.87 billion on March 31, 2006, a decrease of $1.26 billion from the March 31, 2005 balance of $3.13 billion. Cash generated from continuing operations was $1.38 billion and represented the Companys primary source of liquidity in fiscal year 2006. This cash generated was primarily used to fund acquisitions, repay debt and repurchase common shares. In fiscal year 2006, cash provided by continuing operating activities was positively impacted by a decrease of receivable cycles and an increase of payable cycles. During the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the Company undertook a review of its accounts receivable and accounts payable collection/payment cycles and determined that improvements in each could be made. The improvements associated with accounts receivable were related principally to improved collection procedures, including an increased emphasis on obtaining payment of initial customer invoices at the time of contract signing. Management believes that these improvements are sustainable but any further improvements in the accounts receivable collection cycle will not materially impact liquidity in future years. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $106 million was principally related to a concerted effort to make payments to vendors on an extended basis. Management has determined that its payables cycle has exceeded an optimal level and that it should be reduced. Therefore, the Company expects a reduction in the level of days payable outstanding, which will likely have an adverse effect on future cash provided by operating activities, particularly in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. Under both the prior business model and current business model, customers generally pay for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement. We refer to these payments as installment payments. While the transition to the current business model has changed the timing of revenue recognition, in most cases it has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers. As a result, our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the transition to the current business model over the past several years. We do not expect any significant changes in our cash generated from operations as a result of this transition. The timing and amount of installment payments committed under any specific license agreement is often the result of negotiations with the customer and can vary from year to year. In fiscal year 2006, our cash provided by continuing operations was positively impacted by certain arrangements under which the entire contract value or a substantial portion of the contract value was due in one single installment upon execution of the agreement, rather than being invoiced on an annual basis over the life of the contract. Upon receipt, these amounts are reflected as increases in deferred subscription revenue (collected) in the liability section of the balance sheet. Deferred subscription revenue (collected), both current and non current, of $1.96 billion at March 31, 2006 increased approximately $280 million, compared to $1.68 billion at March 31, 2005. The increase of the non current portion, from $273 million to $448 million, was primarily related to these types of arrangements, approximately half of which related to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. As previously noted, collections of these amounts positively impact current year cash flows provided from operating activities and collections that would have been attributable to later years (i.e. the non current portion) will not be available as a source of cash in such later years as the revenue is recognized. Although we cannot predict with certainty the amount of future license agreements that will be executed with similar payment terms, we expect the aggregate dollar value of these arrangements to decline in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. The Companys estimate of the fair value of net installment accounts receivable recorded under the prior business model approximates carrying value. Amounts due from customers under our business model are offset by deferred subscription value related to these license agreements, leaving no or minimal net carrying value on the balance sheet for such amounts. The fair value of such amounts may exceed this carrying value but cannot be practically assessed since there is no existing market for a pool of customer receivables with contractual commitments similar to those 46 Table of Contents owned by us. The actual fair value may not be known until these amounts are sold, securitized, or collected. Although these customer license agreements commit the customer to payment under a fixed schedule, the agreements are considered executory in nature due to the ongoing commitment to provide unspecified future upgrades as part of the agreement terms. Under our business model, we can estimate the total amounts to be billed and or collected at the conclusion of a reporting period. For current business model contracts, amounts we expect to bill within the next fiscal year at March 31, 2006, declined by $0.11 billion to approximately $1.68 billion from the prior year. Amounts we expect to bill for periods after 12 months declined by $0.45 billion to $1.24 billion. These declines are due to a combination of the accelerated payments noted above and the timing of the renewal of existing contracts. The estimated amounts expected to be collected and a reconciliation of such amounts to the amounts we recorded as accounts receivable are as follows: Reconciliation of Amounts to be Collected to Accounts Receivable March 31, March 31, 2006 2005 (restated) (in millions) Current: Accounts receivable $ 828 $ 794 Other receivables 77 39 Amounts to be billed within the next 12 months business model 1,680 1,794 Amounts to be billed within the next 12 months prior business model 254 391 Less: allowance for doubtful accounts (25 ) (35 ) Net amounts expected to be collected current 2,814 2,983 Less: Unamortized discounts (44 ) (62 ) Unearned maintenance (4 ) (23 ) Deferred subscription revenue current, billed (534 ) (314 ) Deferred subscription value current, uncollected (476 ) (661 ) Deferred subscription value noncurrent, uncollected, related to current accounts receivable (1,204 ) (1,133 ) Unearned professional services (47 ) (14 ) Trade and installment accounts receivable current, net 505 776 Non Current: Amounts to be billed beyond the next 12 months business model 1,236 1,698 Amounts to be billed beyond the next 12 months prior business model 511 759 Less: allowance for doubtful accounts (20 ) (53 ) Net amounts expected to be collected noncurrent 1,727 2,404 Less: Unamortized discounts (34 ) (79 ) Unearned maintenance (8 ) (32 ) Deferred subscription value noncurrent, uncollected (1,236 ) (1,698 ) Installment accounts receivable noncurrent, net 449 595 Total accounts receivable, net $ 954 $ 1,371 47 Table of Contents March 31, March 31, 2006 2005 (restated) (in millions) Deferred Subscription Value: Deferred subscription revenue (collected) current $ 1,517 $ 1,407 Deferred subscription revenue (collected) noncurrent 448 273 Deferred subscription revenue current, billed 534 314 Deferred subscription value current, uncollected 476 661 Deferred subscription value noncurrent, uncollected, related to current accounts receivable 1,204 1,133 Deferred subscription value noncurrent, uncollected 1,236 1,698 Aggregate deferred subscription value balance $ 5,415 $ 5,486 Approximately 11% of the total deferred subscription value balance of approximately $5.42 billion at March 31, 2006 is associated with multi year contracts signed with the U.S. Federal Government and other U.S. state and local governmental agencies that are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and or may be terminated at the convenience of the government. While funding under these contracts is not assured, we do not believe any circumstances exist which might indicate that such funding will not be approved and paid in accordance with the terms of our contracts. For any contracts with governmental agencies who are first time customers that are subject to annual fiscal funding approval, we generally do not record the deferred subscription value for the unbilled portion of the contract until the funding is approved. We also receive contracts from non U.S. governmental agencies that contain similar provisions. The total balance of deferred subscription value related to non U.S. governmental agencies that may be terminated at the convenience of the agencies is not material to the overall deferred subscription value balance. Unbilled amounts under the Companys business model are collectible over one to five years. As of March 31, 2006, on a cumulative basis, approximately 58%, 87%, 97%, 99% and 100% of amounts due from customers recorded under the Companys business model come due within fiscal years ended 2007 through 2011, respectively. Unbilled amounts under the prior business model are collectible over three to six years. As of March 31, 2006, on a cumulative basis, approximately 33%, 53%, 68%, 82% and 94% of amounts due from customers recorded under the prior business model come due within fiscal years ended 2007 through 2011, respectively. Fiscal Year 2006 compared to Fiscal Year 2005 Operating Activities Cash generated from continuing operating activities for fiscal year 2006 of $1.38 billion declined by approximately 10% compared to the prior years cash from continuing operations of $1.53 billion. The decrease in cash generated from continuing operations was the result of several factors. The Company experienced an increase of approximately $254 million in collections on accounts receivable compared to the prior year. This increase was more than offset by year over year increases in payments for taxes of approximately $195 million, incremental restitution fund payments of $75 million, and higher payments to vendors and employees of approximately $165 million. The level of payments to vendors in the current year was favorably impacted by the Companys concerted effort to extend payment terms. In fiscal year 2006, the Company experienced an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $106 million, compared to the prior year which experienced a decrease of $141 million. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was approximately $847 million compared to $740 million in the prior year. The change in cash from investing activities primarily relates to $1.01 billion of cash used to fund recent acquisitions. Partly offsetting the cash used for acquisitions was $398 million in cash received from the sales of marketable securities. In addition, the Company also entered into three sale/leaseback transactions during the second half of 48 Table of Contents fiscal year 2006, due to our restructuring initiatives and our associated review of the benefits of owning versus leasing certain properties. Total cash realized from these transactions was approximately $75 million. All of these transactions were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 28, Accounting for Sales with Leasebacks an amendment of FASB Statement No. 13. Financing Activities The primary use of cash for financing activities has been the repayment of debt and the repurchase of common stock, as discussed above. As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, our debt arrangements consisted of the following: 2006 2005 Maximum Outstanding Maximum Outstanding Available Balance Available Balance (in millions) Debt Arrangements 2004 Revolving Credit Facility (expires December 2008) $ 1,000 $ $ 1,000 $ 6.375% Senior Notes due April 2005 825 6.500% Senior Notes due April 2008 350 350 4.750% Senior Notes due December 2009 500 500 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009 460 460 5.625% Senior Notes due December 2014 500 500 Other 1 1 Total $ 1,811 $ 2,636 At March 31, 2006, we had $1.81 billion in debt and $1.87 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our net liquidity position was approximately $54 million. Additionally, we reported restricted cash balances of $60 million and $67 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which were included in the Other noncurrent assets line item. In April 2005, we repaid, as scheduled, the $825 million 6.375% Senior Notes issued during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999 using our available cash balances (see Fiscal Year 1999 Senior Notes for details). During fiscal year 2005, we issued $1 billion of senior notes and redeemed approximately $660 million in outstanding debt compared to a net debt reduction of approximately $826 million in fiscal year 2004. 2004 Revolving Credit Facility In December 2004, we entered into a new unsecured, revolving credit facility (the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility). The maximum committed amount available under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility is $1 billion, exclusive of incremental credit increases of up to an additional $250 million which are available subject to certain conditions and the agreement of our lenders. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility expires December 2008 and no amount was drawn as of March 31, 2006 or March 31, 2005. Refer to Note 6, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate dependent on our credit ratings at the time of such borrowings and will be calculated according to a base rate or a Eurocurrency rate, as the case may be, plus an applicable margin and utilization fee. Depending on our credit rating at the time of borrowing, the applicable margin can range from 0% to 0.325% for a base rate borrowing and from 0.50% to 1.325% for a Eurocurrency borrowing, and the utilization fee can range from 0.125% to 0.250%. At our current credit ratings in July 2006, the applicable margin would be 0.025% for a base rate borrowing and 1.025% for a Eurocurrency borrowing, and the utilization fee would be 0.125%. In addition, we must pay facility fees quarterly at rates dependent on our credit ratings. The facility fees can range from 0.125% to 0.30% of the aggregate amount of each lenders full revolving credit commitment (without taking into account any outstanding borrowings under such 49 Table of Contents commitments). At our credit ratings in July 2006, the facility fee is 0.225% of the aggregate amount of each lenders revolving credit commitment. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants for transactions of this type, including two financial covenants: (i) for the 12 months ending each quarter end, the ratio of consolidated debt for borrowed money to consolidated cash flow, each as defined in the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, must not exceed 3.25 for the quarter ending December 31, 2004 and 2.75 for quarters ending March 31, 2005 and thereafter; and (ii) for the 12 months ending each quarter end, the ratio of consolidated cash flow to the sum of interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, all consolidated debt for borrowed money, as defined in the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, must not be less than 5.00. In addition, as a condition precedent to each borrowing made under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, as of the date of such borrowing, (i) no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) we are to reaffirm that the representations and warranties made in the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility (other than the representation with respect to material adverse changes, but including the representation regarding the absence of certain material litigation) are correct. On June 29, 2006, we obtained a waiver from all participating banks under the credit facility to file our financial statements within the 90 day required period. The waiver extends this period through August 28, 2006. Upon the filing of this Form 10 K we believe we are in compliance with our debt covenants. Fiscal Year 1999 Senior Notes In fiscal year 1999, the Company issued $1.75 billion of unsecured Senior Notes in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (Rule 144A). Amounts borrowed, rates, and maturities for each issue were $575 million at 6.25% due April 15, 2003, $825 million at 6.375% due April 15, 2005, and $350 million at 6.5% due April 15, 2008. In April 2005, the Company repaid the $825 million remaining balance of the 6.375% Senior Notes from available cash balances. As of March 31, 2006, $350 million of the 6.5% Senior Notes remained outstanding. Fiscal Year 2005 Senior Notes In November 2004, the Company issued an aggregate of $1 billion of unsecured Senior Notes (2005 Senior Notes) in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A. The Company issued $500 million of 4.75%, 5 year notes due December 2009 and $500 million of 5.625%, 10 year notes due December 2014. The Company has the option to redeem the 2005 Senior Notes at any time, at redemption prices equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series being redeemed and (ii) the present value of the principal and interest payable over the life of the 2005 Senior Notes, discounted at a rate equal to 15 basis points and 20 basis points for the 5 year notes and 10 year notes, respectively, over a comparable U.S. Treasury bond yield. The maturity of the 2005 Senior Notes may be accelerated by the holders upon certain events of default, including failure to make payments when due and failure to comply with covenants in the 2005 Senior Notes. The 5 year notes were issued at a price equal to 99.861% of the principal amount and the 10 year notes at a price equal to 99.505% of the principal amount for resale under Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Company also agreed for the benefit of the holders to register the 2005 Senior Notes under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to a registered exchange offer so that the 2005 Senior Notes may be sold in the public market. Because the Company did not meet certain deadlines for completion of the exchange offer, the interest rate on the 2005 Senior Notes increased by 25 basis points as of September 27, 2005 and increased by an additional 25 basis points as of December 26, 2005 since the delay was not cured prior to that date. After the delay is cured, such additional interest on the 2005 Senior Notes will no longer be payable. The Company expects to register the 2005 Senior Notes in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. The Company used the net proceeds from this issuance to repay debt as described above. 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes In fiscal year 2003, the Company issued $460 million of unsecured 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes (1.625% Notes), due December 15, 2009, in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A. The 1.625% Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with all existing senior unsecured indebtedness. Concurrent with the issuance of the 1.625% Notes, we entered into call spread repurchase option transactions to partially mitigate potential dilution from conversion of the 1.625% Notes. For further information, refer to Note 6, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 Table of Contents 3% Concord Convertible Notes In connection with our acquisition of Concord in June 2005, we assumed $86 million in 3% convertible senior notes due 2023. In accordance with the notes terms, we redeemed (for cash) the notes in full in July 2005. International Line of Credit An unsecured and uncommitted multi currency line of credit is available to meet short term working capital needs for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States. The line of credit is available on an offering basis, meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions, including interest rate, maturity, representations, covenants and events of default, as mutually agreed between our subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction. As of March 31, 2006, this line totaled approximately $5 million and approximately $3 million was pledged in support of bank guarantees. Amounts drawn under these facilities as of March 31, 2006 were minimal. In addition to the above facility, our foreign subsidiaries use guarantees issued by commercial banks to guarantee performance on certain contracts. At March 31, 2006 the aggregate amount of significant guarantees outstanding was approximately $5 million, none of which had been drawn down by third parties. Share Repurchases, Stock Option Exercises and Dividends We repurchased approximately $590 million of common stock in connection with our publicly announced corporate buyback program in fiscal year 2006 compared with $161 million in fiscal year 2005; we received approximately $97 million in proceeds resulting from the exercise of Company stock options in fiscal year 2006 compared with $73 million in fiscal year 2005; and we paid dividends of $93 million, $47 million and $47 million in each of the fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As announced in April 2005, beginning in fiscal year 2006 we increased our annual cash dividend to $0.16 per share, which was paid out in quarterly installments of $0.04 per share as and when declared by the Board of Directors. On June 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion common stock repurchase plan for fiscal year 2007 which will replace the $600 million common stock repurchase plan announced in March 2006. We expect to finance the stock repurchase plan through a combination of cash on hand and bank financing. Effect of Exchange Rate Changes There was a negative $63 million impact to our cash flows in fiscal year 2006 predominantly due to the weakening of the British pound and the euro against the dollar of approximately 8% and 6%, respectively. In fiscal year 2005, we had a $47 million favorable impact to our cash flows predominantly due to a strengthening of the pound and euro of approximately 3% and 5%, respectively. Other Matters At March 31, 2006, our senior unsecured notes were rated Ba1, BBB , and BBB and were on positive, negative and stable outlook by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively. In June 2006, our senior unsecured notes ratings remained at Ba1, BBB, and BBB by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively, all with a negative outlook. Following the announcement of the delayed filing of our Form 10 K beyond its extended due date of June 29, 2006 and the announcement of our $2 billion stock buy back program, S&P and Fitch downgraded our ratings to BB and BB+, respectively. As of July 2006, Moodys has placed us under review for possible downgrade, the outlook from Fitch is negative and S&P has placed our notes on CreditWatch with negative implications. Peak borrowings under all debt facilities during the fiscal year 2006 totaled approximately $2.64 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.9%. In March 2005, we pre funded contributions to the CA Savings Harvest Plan, a 401(k) plan. The Company elected not to pre fund its contribution in March 2006 as a result of IRS Treasury Regulations eliminating the tax benefit associated with the pre funding of elective and matching contributions. 51 Table of Contents Capital resource requirements as of March 31, 2006 consisted of lease obligations for office space, equipment, mortgage and loan obligations, our ERP implementation, and amounts due as a result of product and company acquisitions. Refer to Contractual Obligations and Commitments for additional information. It is expected that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines and in the capital markets, and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. We expect our long standing history of providing extended payment terms to our customers to continue. We expect to use existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund financing activities such as the repayment of our debt balances as they mature as well as the repurchase of shares of common stock and the payment of dividends as approved by our Board of Directors. Cash generated will also be used for investing activities such as future acquisitions as well as additional capital spending, including our continued investment in our ERP implementation. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have commitments to invest approximately $3 million in connection with joint venture agreements. Prior to fiscal year 2001, we sold individual accounts receivable under the prior business model to a third party subject to certain recourse provisions. The outstanding principal balance subject to recourse of these receivables approximated $146 million and $183 million as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of March 31, 2006, we have not incurred any losses related to these receivables. Other than the commitments and recourse provisions described above, we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and, accordingly, off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with current accounting rules, the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at March 31, 2006 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. In addition, the table summarizes the timing of payments on our debt obligations as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (in millions) Contractual Obligations Long term debt obligations (inclusive of interest) $ 2,223 $ 85 $ 506 $ 1,048 $ 584 Operating lease obligations(1) 612 128 186 111 187 Purchase obligations 118 50 37 25 6 Other long term liabilities(2) 78 17 25 14 22 Total $ 3,031 $ 280 $ 754 $ 1,198 $ 799 (1) The contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases include sublease income totaling $93 million expected to be received in the following periods: $25 million (less than 1 year); $40 million (1 3 years); $18 million (3 5 years); and $10 million (more than 5 years). (2) Other long term liabilities primarily relate to operating expenses associated with operating lease obligations. 52 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2006, we have no material capital lease obligations, either individually or in the aggregate. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2007 This outlook contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs and assumptions made by management, as well as information currently available to management. Should business conditions change or should our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described below. We do not intend to update these forward looking statements. The outlook for our fiscal year 2007 is based on the assumption that there will be limited to modest improvement in the current economic and IT environments. We also believe customers will continue to be cautious with their technology purchases. Our preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2007 is to generate revenue of approximately $3.9 billion, earnings per share of approximately $0.44 as calculated on a GAAP basis, and cash generated from operations of $1.3 billion. We expect that: We will incur approximately $105 million (pre tax) in non cash stock based compensation charges in connection with SFAS No. 123(R) (we incurred approximately $99 million of total stock based compensation charges in fiscal year 2006); Cash generated from operations will be negatively impacted by an additional $200 million in tax payments, higher disbursements due to a decline in the days payables cycle and lower collections from contracts with accelerated payment terms; and Our effective tax rate should be approximately 34% in fiscal year 2007. This outlook has not been adjusted to reflect the $2 billion common stock repurchase plan for fiscal year 2007 or the impact of any related financing activities. This outlook also assumes that the Company will take steps to achieve certain cost savings. These steps may have related non operating costs that would have a negative effect on GAAP earnings per share. The Company has not yet identified these savings or quantified their potential impact on GAAP earnings per share, and it is possible that GAAP earnings per share could be lower than the amount included in this outlook. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. We consider the following significant accounting polices to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources: (1) licensing software products; (2) providing customer technical support (referred to as maintenance); and (3) providing professional services, such as consulting and education. We recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Position 97 2 Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97 2), issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as amended by SOP 98 9 Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. In 53 Table of Contents accordance with SOP 97 2, we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software products when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer; (2) we deliver the products; (3) license agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final; and (4) collection is probable. Our software licenses generally do not include acceptance provisions. An acceptance provision allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software. If a license agreement includes an acceptance provision, we do not record deferred subscription value or recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or, if not notified by the customer to cancel the license agreement, the expiration of the acceptance period. Under our business model, software license agreements include flexible contractual provisions that, among other things, allow customers to receive unspecified future software upgrades for no additional fee. These agreements combine the right to use the software product with maintenance for the term of the agreement. Under these agreements, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning upon completion of the four SOP 97 2 recognition criteria noted above. For license agreements signed prior to October 2000 (the prior business model), once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met, software license fees were recognized as revenue up front, and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license. Maintenance revenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) combined license and maintenance agreements recorded under the prior business model; and (2) stand alone maintenance agreements. Under the prior business model, maintenance and license fees were generally combined into a single license agreement. The maintenance portion was deferred and amortized into revenue over the initial license agreement term. Some of these license agreements have not reached the end of their initial terms and, therefore, continue to amortize. This amortization is recorded on the Maintenance line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The deferred maintenance portion, which was optional to the customer, was determined using its fair value based on annual, fixed maintenance renewal rates stated in the agreement. For license agreements entered into under our current business model, maintenance and license fees continue to be combined; however, the maintenance is inclusive for the entire term. We report such combined fees on the Subscription revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also record stand alone maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance. Revenue from such renewals is recognized as maintenance revenue over the term of the renewal agreement. The Deferred maintenance revenue line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheets principally represents payments received in advance of maintenance services rendered. Revenue from professional service arrangements is recognized pursuant to the provisions of SOP 97 2, which in most cases is as the services are performed. Revenues from professional services that are sold as part of a software transaction are deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the life of the related software transaction. If it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed. Revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and VARs is recognized when all four of the SOP 97 2 revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software product to their customers. This is commonly referred to as the sell through method. Beginning July 1, 2004, sales of our products made by distributors, resellers and VARs to their customers incorporate the right for the end users to receive certain upgraded software products at no additional fee. Accordingly, revenue from those contracts is recognized on a ratable basis. We have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and have a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under such agreements. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed through the receipt of cash payment. 54 Table of Contents Our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products. Such warranties are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. Under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements, we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on, among other things, allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. In most cases, in the event of an infringement claim, we retain the right to (i) procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product; (ii) replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be reasonably achieved, we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid. Such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. In most cases and where legally enforceable, the indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer. Accounts Receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for the potential impairment of accounts receivable on the balance sheet. In developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts, we rely on several factors, including: Historical information, such as general collection history of multi year software agreements; Current customer information/events, such as extended delinquency, requests for restructuring, and filing for bankruptcy; Results of analyzing historical and current data; and The overall macroeconomic environment. The allowance is comprised of two components: (a) specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when, based on current information, we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer; and (b) an allowance for losses inherent in the remaining receivable portfolio based on the analysis of the specifically reviewed receivables. We expect the allowance for doubtful accounts to continue to decline as net installment accounts receivable under the prior business model are billed and collected. Under our business model, amounts due from customers are offset by deferred subscription value (unearned revenue) related to these amounts, resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet. Therefore, a smaller allowance for doubtful accounts is required. Sales Commissions We accrue sales commissions based on, among other things, estimates of how our sales personnel will perform against specified annual sales quotas. These estimates involve assumptions regarding the Companys projected new product sales and billings. All of these assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties, and as a result, if other assumptions had been used in the period, sales commission expense could have been impacted for that period. Under our current sales compensation model, during periods of high growth and sales of new products relative to revenue in that period, the amount of sales commission expense attributable to the license agreement would be recognized fully in the year and could negatively impact income and earnings per share in that period, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year when new contract values are traditionally higher than in the first half. Income Taxes When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction; estimate differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement purposes versus tax return purposes 55 Table of Contents (known as temporary differences), which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities; and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets and net operating losses will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We have recognized as a deferred tax asset a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations. As of March 31, 2006, our gross deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance, totaled $602 million. Realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized. The factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets result from acquisition expenses, such as duplicate facility costs, employee severance and other costs that are not deductible until paid, net operating losses (NOLs) and temporary differences between the taxable cash payments received from customers and the ratable recognition of revenue in accordance with GAAP. The NOLs expire between 2007 and 2026. Additionally, approximately $57 million and $28 million of the valuation allowance as of March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005, respectively, is attributable to acquired NOLs which are subject to annual limitations under IRS Code Section 382. Future results may vary from these estimates. At this time it is not practicable to determine if we will need to increase the valuation allowance or if such future valuations will have a material impact on our financial statements. Goodwill, Capitalized Software Products, and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill. Absent any prior indicators of impairment, we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We performed our annual assessment for fiscal year 2006 and concluded that there were no impairments to record. The SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model is a two step process. The first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test, and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test, is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions. These estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management. This approach uses significant assumptions, including projected future cash flow, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flow, and a terminal growth rate. The carrying value of capitalized software products, both purchased software and internally developed software, and other intangible assets, are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of internal and external facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of cost for other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date. It is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or, if such an impairment were to occur, the magnitude thereof. 56 Table of Contents Product Development and Enhancements We account for product development and enhancements in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates. If other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility, the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been impacted. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation We currently maintain stock based compensation plans. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain stock based awards. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk free interest rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years. As described in Note 9, Stock Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, performance share units are awards granted under the long term incentive plan for senior executives where the number of shares or restricted shares as applicable, ultimately received by the employee depends on Company performance measured against specified targets and will be determined after a three year or one year period as applicable. The fair value of each award is estimated on the date that the performance targets are established based on the fair value of the Companys stock and the Companys estimate of the level of achievement of its performance targets. Each quarter, the Company compares the actual performance the Company expects to achieve with the performance targets. Legal Contingencies We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability of a loss and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims, and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material legal proceedings. New Accounting Pronouncements In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law. This act introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision), provided that certain criteria are met. In addition, on December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP FAS 109 2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. The Company repatriated approximately $584 million of cash under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 during fiscal year 2006 at a total tax cost of approximately $55 million. Refer to the Income Taxes section of this MD&A for further details. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 is 57 Table of Contents effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the Companys second quarter of fiscal year 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation, as that term is used in FASB No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company was required to apply the provisions of FIN 47 in fiscal year 2006. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, or SFAS No. 154, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS Statement 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principle required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income in the period of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, however, the Statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position 115 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, or FSP 115 1, that addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. FSP 115 1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments. The guidance in FSP 115 1 amends SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. The final FSP nullifies certain requirements of EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, and supersedes EITF Topic No. D 44, Recognition of Other Than Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a Security Whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value. The guidance in FSP 115 1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FSP 115 1 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, debt, and installment accounts receivable. We have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in liquid investments that are comprised of money market funds and debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers (Standard & Poors single A rating and higher). To mitigate risk, many of the securities have a maturity date within one year, and holdings of any one issuer, excluding the U.S. government, do not exceed 10% of the portfolio. Periodically, the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated. As of March 31, 2006, our outstanding debt approximated $1.81 billion, most of which was in fixed rate obligations. If market rates were to decline, we could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates. Each 25 basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $5 million. Each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have no material annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of March 31, 2006. As of March 31, 2006, we did not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate the above mentioned interest rate risks. 58 Table of Contents We offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our software license agreements. The aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element, which can vary with the interest rate environment. Each 25 basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $9 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in 46 countries and, as such, a portion of our revenues, earnings, and net investments in foreign affiliates are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing expected local currency revenues in relation to local currency costs and local currency assets in relation to local currency liabilities. In October 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the Risk Management Policy and Procedures (the Policy), which authorizes us to manage, based on managements assessment, our risks/exposures to foreign currency exchange rates through the use of derivative financial instruments (e.g., forward contracts, options, swaps) or other means. We have not historically used, and do not anticipate using, derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we entered into derivative contracts with a total notional value of 280 million euros. Derivatives with a notional value of 80 million euros were entered into with the intent of mitigating a certain portion of our euro operating exposure and are part of the Companys on going risk management program. Derivatives with a notional value of 200 million euros were entered into during March 2006 with the intent of mitigating a certain portion of the foreign exchange variability associated with the Companys repatriation of approximately $584 million from its foreign subsidiaries. Hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133 was not applied to any of the derivatives entered into during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. The resulting gain of approximately $1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 is included in the Other (gains) expenses, net line in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of March 31, 2006, there were no derivative contracts outstanding. In April 2006, the Company entered into similar derivative contracts as those entered during the quarter ended March 31, 2006 relating to the Companys operating exposures. Equity Price Risk As of March 31, 2006, we had $22 million in investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies. These securities were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or temporary losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity, and results of operations. The information below has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of the Companys financial results which is more fully described in the Explanatory Note Restatements immediately preceding Part I of this Form 10 K and in Note 12, Restatements, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Overview We are one of the worlds largest providers of IT management software. Our software and expertise enables customers to better manage their complex IT infrastructures across systems and networks, security and storage solutions. Our technology solutions are comprehensive, integrated, real time and open. They are not tied to any one platform, but instead make it possible for customers to manage all of the computers, networks and other technologies that comprise their computing environments. In turn, this helps customers better manage the investments they have made in IT rather than having to rip and replace them. As a result, customers gain flexibility. They can manage risk, manage cost, increase service and better align their IT investments with the needs of their organization. We pursue a number of high growth areas with our products, including network and systems management, security and storage. Our solutions are designed for both mainframe and distributed environments, each of which comprise about half of our revenue. The CA Business Model As described in greater detail in Item 1, Business, of the Companys Form 10 K, we license our software products directly to customers as well as through distributors, resellers, and VARs. We generate revenue from the following sources: license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis; maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements; and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation, consulting, and education services. The timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a reporting period are determined individually by license agreement, based on its duration and specific terms. Under our business model, we provide customers with the flexibility to license software under month to month licenses or to fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements. We also permit customers to change their software mix as their business and technology needs change, which includes the right to receive software in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee, commonly referred to as unspecified future upgrades. As a result of the right our customers have to receive unspecified future upgrades, as well as maintenance included during the term of the license, we are required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States 29 Table of Contents of America (GAAP) to recognize revenue from our license agreements evenly on a monthly basis (also known as ratably) over the license term. We believe recognizing license revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement more accurately reflects the earnings process; we also believe that it improves the predictability of our reported revenue streams. Under agreements entered into prior to October 2000 (the prior business model), and as is common practice in the software industry, we did not offer our customers the right to receive unspecified future upgrades. As a result, for most license agreements entered into prior to October 2000, we were required under GAAP to record the present value of the license agreement as revenue at the time the license agreement was signed. Under our business model, the portion of the contract value that has not yet been recognized creates what we refer to as deferred subscription value. Deferred subscription value is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the license agreements. When recognized, this revenue is reported on the Subscription revenue line item on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue, the amount deferred is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Not all of our active customer contracts have been transitioned to our business model, which has created what we refer to as a Transition Period, during which the license agreements under our prior business model come up for renewal. During this Transition Period, as customer license agreements under our prior business model are renewed under our business model, we are building deferred subscription value related to that customer, from which subscription revenue will be amortized in future periods. Total deferred subscription value, and the associated subscription revenue that comes out of it, may increase over time as we continue to renew customer contracts that were executed under the prior business model, transition acquired company contracts to our business model, sell additional products and capacity to existing customers, and enter into new contracts with new customers. The favorable impact on subscription revenue from the conversion of contracts from our old business model to our new business model will decrease over time as the transition is completed. The remaining balance of unbilled installment receivables that were previously recognized as revenue under our prior business model was $0.76 billion and $1.15 billion at March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005, respectively. While the impact of changing from up front revenue recognition under our prior business model to our current business model resulted in the postponement of the recognition of amounts that previously would have been recognized earlier under the up front model, we generally did not change our cost structure. Under both the prior business model and our current business model, customers often pay for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement. We refer to these payments as installment payments. While the transition to the current business model has changed the timing of revenue recognition, in most cases it has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers. As a result, our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the transition to the current business model over the past several years; and we do not expect in the future any significant changes in our cash generated from operations as a result of this transition. Significant Business Events The Government Investigation In fiscal year 2002, the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern Division of New York (USAO) and the staff of the Northeast Region of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commenced an investigation concerning certain of our past accounting practices, including our revenue recognition procedures in periods prior to the adoption of our business model in October 2000. In September 2004, we reached agreements with the USAO and the SEC by entering into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the USAO and consenting to the entry of a Final Consent Judgment (Consent Judgment) in a parallel proceeding brought by the SEC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the Federal Court). The Federal Court approved the DPA on September 22, 2004 and entered the Consent Judgment on September 28, 2004. The agreements resolved the USAO and SEC investigations into certain of our past accounting practices, including our revenue recognition policies and procedures, and obstruction of their investigations. 30 Table of Contents Under the DPA, we agreed to establish a $225 million fund for purposes of restitution to our current and former stockholders, with $75 million paid within 30 days of the date of approval of the DPA by the Court, $75 million to be paid within one year after the approval date and $75 million to be paid within 18 months after the approval date. We have made all three payments as of March 31, 2006. We have, among other things, taken the following actions: (1) added three new independent directors to the Board of Directors; (2) established a compliance committee of the Board of Directors by amending the charter of its Audit Committee and renaming it as the Audit and Compliance Committee; (3) appointed a Chief Compliance Officer and began implementation of an enhanced compliance and ethics program; (4) reorganized the Finance and Internal Audit Departments; (5) established an executive disclosure committee chaired by the our chief executive officer; and (6) enhanced our Hotline (now Helpline) and issued our Compliance and Helpline Policy. We issued a report on our progress under the DPA and Consent Judgment in the proxy statement filed with the SEC in July 2005. We will report on further progress under the DPA in our 2006 definitive proxy statement to be filed in August 2006. On March 16, 2005, pursuant to the DPA and Consent Judgment, the United States District Court issued an order appointing attorney Lee S. Richards III, Esq., of Richards Spears Kibbe & Orbe LLP, to serve as Independent Examiner. The Independent Examiner is reviewing our compliance with the DPA and Consent Judgment and issued his six month report concerning his recommendations regarding best practices on September 15, 2005. On December 15, 2005, March 15, 2006 and June 15, 2006, Mr. Richards issued his first three quarterly reports concerning our compliance with the DPA. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the government investigation. Internal Control Issues and Possible Extension of Independent Examiners Term of Appointment Under the DPA As described elsewhere in this Form 10 K, we are restating our financial results for prior fiscal periods as well as current and prior interim periods during fiscal years 2006 and 2005 because we did not properly recognize non cash stock based compensation expense, subscription revenue, or sales commission expense for certain periods. In addition, our outside auditors determined that we did not properly calculate our taxes for certain non routine tax matters in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and had to adjust them. As a result of these errors and other matters, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in Item 9A of this Form 10 K. Under the DPA, we are obligated, among other things, to take certain steps to improve internal controls and to reorganize our Finance Department. If we have not substantially implemented these and other required reforms for a period of at least two successive quarters before September 30, 2006, the USAO and the SEC may, in their discretion, extend the term of the Independent Examiner. In his Fourth Report dated June 15, 2006, the Independent Examiner expressed the view that, in light of certain internal control issues, which are described further in Item 9A of this Form 10 K, including the fact that we have not yet hired a new chief financial officer, he is no longer able to conclude that we will be able to meet our obligation under the DPA to have improved internal controls and reorganized the Finance Department for two successive quarters prior to September 30, 2006. Consequently, we believe that the term of the Independent Examiner may be extended beyond September 30, 2006. Whether the USAO and the SEC will decide to extend the term or take any other action in connection with the DPA will be made by them in their discretion. We are continuing to review these matters to determine what further steps we should take to address the internal control issues referenced above. On July 28, 2006, we announced that Nancy E. Cooper was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, reporting to our Chief Executive Officer. Her appointment is effective on or about August 15, 2006. Acquisitions and Divestitures In March 2006, we acquired the common stock of Wily Technology, Inc. (Wily), a provider of enterprise application management solutions, for a total purchase price of approximately $374 million, or approximately $361 million net of acquired cash and marketable securities. Wily is a provider of enterprise application management software solutions that enable companies to manage their web applications and infrastructure. The acquisition of Wily extends our application management offerings. 31 Table of Contents In December 2005, we acquired Control F 1 Corporation (Control F 1) for a total purchase price of approximately $14 million. Control F 1 was a privately held provider of support automation solutions that automatically prevent, detect and repair end user computer problems before they disrupt critical IT services. CA markets the Control F1 solutions as stand alone products and has incorporated them into our portfolio of Business Service Optimization solutions, which help customers reduce costs, improve service levels, and better align IT with the business. In December 2005, we sold our wholly owned subsidiary MultiGen Paradigm, Inc. (MultiGen) to Parallax Capital Partners. MultiGen was a provider of real time, end to end 3D solutions for visualizations, simulations and training applications used for both civilian and government purposes. As a result of the sale, we recognized a gain on the disposal of $3 million, net of taxes, which is classified in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In November 2005, we announced an agreement with Garnett & Helfrich Capital, a private equity firm, to create an independent corporate entity, Ingres Corporation. We divested our Ingres open source database unit into Ingres Corporation, in which Garnett & Helfrich Capital is the majority shareholder. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a non cash pre tax gain of approximately $7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006. In October 2005, we completed the acquisition of iLumin Software Services, Inc. (iLumin), a privately held provider of enterprise message management and archiving software, for a total purchase price of approximately $48 million. iLumins Assentor product line has been added to our BrightStor solutions. In July 2005, we acquired Niku Corporation (Niku), a provider of information technology management and governance solutions, for a total purchase price of approximately $345 million, or approximately $282 million net of acquired cash and marketable securities. Nikus primary software product, Clarity IT MG, is an integrated suite that spans and strengthens the IT governance offering of our Business Service Optimization business unit to the full IT life cycle, from investment selection, to execution and delivery of initiatives, to results assessment. In June 2005, we acquired Concord Communications, Inc. (Concord), a provider of network service management software solutions, for a total purchase price of approximately $359 million, or approximately $283 million net of acquired cash and marketable securities. Concord is a provider of infrastructure software principally in the areas of network health, performance, and fault management. We have made Concords eHealth and Spectrum software available both as independent products and as integrated components of our Unicenter product portfolio in our Enterprise Systems Management business unit. In connection with the acquisition, we assumed $86 million in 3% convertible senior notes due 2023. In accordance with the notes terms, we redeemed (for cash) the notes in full in July 2005. In November 2004, we completed the acquisition of Netegrity, Inc. (Netegrity), a provider of business security software solutions in the area of access and identity management, for a total purchase price of approximately $455 million, or approximately $358 million net of acquired cash and marketable securities. Netegrity was a provider of business security software, principally in the areas of identity and access management, and we have made Netegritys identity and access management solutions available both as independent products and as integrated components of our eTrust Identity and Access Management Suite in our Security Management business unit. In August 2004, we acquired PestPatrol, Inc. (PestPatrol), a privately held provider of anti spyware and security solutions, for a total purchase price of approximately $40 million. The products acquired in this transaction were integrated into our eTrust Threat Management software product portfolio in our Security Management business unit. This portfolio protects organizations from diverse Internet dangers such as viruses, spam, and inappropriate use of the Web by employees. In March 2004, we sold our approximate 90% interest in ACCPAC International, Inc. (ACCPAC). ACCPAC provided accounting, customer relationship management, human resources, warehouse management, manufacturing, electronic data interchange, and point of sale software for small and medium sized businesses. Our net proceeds totaled $104 million for all of our outstanding equity interests in ACCPAC, including options and change of control payments for certain ACCPAC officers and managers. We received approximately $90 million of the net proceeds in fiscal year 2004 and the remainder in fiscal year 2005. As a result of the sale, we realized a gain, net of taxes, of approximately $60 million in fiscal year 2004. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we recorded 32 Table of Contents an adjustment to the gain of $2 million, net of tax, reducing the net gain to $58 million. The sale completed our multi year effort to exit the business applications market. Performance Indicators Management uses several quantitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition. Each provides a measurement of the performance of our business model and how well we are executing our plan. Our subscription based business model is unique among our competitors in the software industry and particularly during the Transition Period it is difficult to compare our results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors. The following is a summary of the principal quantitative performance indicators that management uses to review performance: Percent For the Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 Change Change (restated) (in millions) Subscription revenue $ 2,838 $ 2,587 $ 251 10 % Total revenue $ 3,796 $ 3,603 $ 193 5 % Subscription revenue as a percent of total revenue 75 % 72 % 3 % N/A Deferred subscription value $ 5,415 $ 5,486 $ (71 ) (1 ) % New deferred subscription value (direct) $ 2,610 $ 3,493 $ (883 ) (25 ) % New deferred subscription value (indirect) $ 195 $ 144 $ 51 35 % Weighted average license agreement duration in years (direct) 3.03 3.10 (.07 ) (2 ) % Cash from continuing operating activities 1,380 1,527 $ (147 ) (10 ) % Income from continuing operations 156 26 $ 130 500 % Percent As of March 31, 2006 2005 Change Change (in millions) Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 1,865 $ 3,125 $ (1,260 ) (40 )% Total debt $ 1,811 $ 2,636 $ (825 ) (31 )% Analyses of our performance indicators, including general trends, can be found in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MD&A. The performance indicators discussed below are those that we believe are unique because of our subscription based business model. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue is the ratable revenue recognized in a period from amounts previously recorded as deferred subscription value. If the weighted average life of our license agreements remains constant, an increase in deferred subscription value will result in an increase in subscription revenue. Deferred Subscription Value Under our business model, the portion of the license contract value that has not yet been earned creates what we refer to as deferred subscription value. As revenue is ratably recognized (evenly on a monthly basis), it is reported as Subscription Revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the deferred subscription value attributable to that contract is correspondingly reduced. When recognized as revenue, the amount is reported on the Subscription revenue line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a customer pays for software prior to the recognition of revenue, the amount is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers do not always pay for software in equal annual installments over the life of a license agreement. The amount collected under a license agreement for the next twelve months but not yet recognized as revenue is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount paid under a license agreement for periods subsequent to the next twelve months, which will be recognized as revenue on a monthly basis only in those future years, is reported as a liability entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) noncurrent on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase or decrease in current payments attributable to periods subsequent to the next twelve months is reported as an operating activity entitled Deferred subscription revenue (collected) noncurrent in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 33 Table of Contents Payments received in the current period that are attributable to later years of a license agreement have a positive impact in the current period on billings and cash provided by continuing operating activities. Accordingly, to the extent such payments are attributable to the later years of a license agreement, the license would provide a correspondingly reduced contribution to billings and cash from operating activities during the licenses later years. New Deferred Subscription Value New deferred subscription value represents the total incremental value (contract value) of software licenses sold in a period, which will be accounted for under our subscription model of revenue recognition. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we began offering more flexible license terms to our channel partners end users, necessitating ratable recognition of revenue for the majority of our indirect business. Prior to July 1, 2004, such channel license revenue had been recorded up front on a sell through basis (when a distributor, reseller, or VAR sells the software product to its customers) and reported on the Software fees and other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. New deferred subscription value excludes the value associated with single year maintenance only license agreements, license only indirect sales, and professional services arrangements and does not include that portion of bundled maintenance or unamortized discounts that are converted into subscription revenue upon renewal of prior business model contracts. New deferred subscription value is what we expect to collect over time from our customers based upon contractual license agreements entered into during a reporting period. This amount is recognized as subscription revenue ratably over the applicable software license term. The license agreements that contribute to new deferred subscription value represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods generally up to three years. Our new deferred subscription value typically increases in each consecutive fiscal quarter, with the fourth quarter being the strongest. However, since new deferred subscription value is impacted by the volume and dollar amount of contracts coming up for renewal and the amount of early contract renewals, the change in new deferred subscription value, relative to previous periods, does not necessarily correlate to the change in billings or cash receipts, relative to previous periods. The contribution to current period revenue from new deferred subscription value from any single license agreement is relatively small, since revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable license agreement term. Weighted Average License Agreement Duration in Years The weighted average license agreement duration in years reflects the duration of all software licenses executed during a period, weighted to reflect the contract value of each individual software license. The weighted average duration is impacted by the volume and dollar amount of contracts coming up for renewal, and therefore may change from period to period and will not necessarily correlate to the prior year periods. The annual weighted average duration of 3.03 and 3.10 years for the fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively, were derived from the following quarterly new deferred subscription revenue amounts and quarterly weighted average durations in years from our direct business: Fiscal Year 2006 Fiscal Year 2005 New Deferred Weighted New Deferred Weighted Subscription Average Subscription Average Value from Duration Value from Duration in Direct Sales in Years Direct Sales Years (in millions) Fourth Quarter $ 969 2.89 $ 1,469 3.40 Third Quarter 730 3.46 845 2.95 Second Quarter 575 2.92 649 2.90 First Quarter 336 2.70 530 2.75 $ 2,610 3.03 $ 3,493 3.10 We believe license agreement durations averaging approximately three years increase the value customers receive from our software licenses by giving customers the flexibility to vary their software mix as their needs change. We also believe this flexibility improves our customer relationships and encourages greater accountability by us to each of our customers. The increase in the weighted average durations for contracts signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2006 is due to several individual longer term contracts signed during those quarters (e.g., four to five years). 34 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenue The following table presents the percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the revenue line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2006 Fiscal Year 2005 Percentage Percentage of of Percentage of Dollar Percentage of Dollar Total Change Total Change Revenue 2006/ Revenue 2005/ 2006 2005 2005 2005 2004 2004 (restated) (restated) (restated) Revenue: Subscription revenue 75 % 72 % 10 % 72 % 63 % 22 % Maintenance 11 % 12 % (2 )% 12 % 16 % (15 )% Software fees and other 4 % 7 % (36 )% 7 % 10 % (23 )% Financing fees 1 % 2 % (42 )% 2 % 4 % (43 )% Professional services 9 % 7 % 32 % 7 % 7 % 4 % Total revenue 100 % 100 % 5 % 100 % 100 % 8 % Total Revenue Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased $193 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, to $3.80 billion. This increase was partially a result of the transition to our business model, which contributed additional subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year as we continue to add incremental subscription revenue for contracts that are renewals of prior business model contracts for which revenue was previously recognized up front for multiple year licenses under our old business model. The increase in total revenue was also partially attributable to the sales of Concord, Niku, iLumin, and Wily products, which contributed approximately $125 million of separately identifiable revenue. It is expected that software fees and other revenue and maintenance revenue attributable to acquisitions will decline as these acquired products transition to our business model and revenue attributable to these acquired products is reported as subscription revenue. In addition, revenue for fiscal year 2006 was negatively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by approximately $17 million compared with fiscal year 2005. Total revenue in fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005 was negatively impacted by decreases in maintenance and financing fees resulting from how these items are accounted for under our business model. The recognition of maintenance and financing fees under our business model is discussed further under Subscription Revenue in this MD&A. Our revenue was further negatively impacted by the fact that since the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, revenue from certain contracts in our channel business has been, and continues to be, recorded as new deferred subscription value, which will be ratably recognized into subscription revenue in future periods compared to prior periods when the majority of such revenue was recognized on an up front basis. Total revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased $271 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, to $3.60 billion. This increase was partially a result of the transition to our business model, which contributed additional subscription revenue from the prior fiscal year. The increase in total revenue was also partially attributable to the sales of Netegrity products which contributed approximately $32 million of revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2005. In addition, as our international contracts are denominated in local currencies, the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound, as well as certain other currencies, against the U.S. dollar increased our revenue by approximately $103 million. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue represents the portion of revenue ratably recognized on software license agreements entered into under our business model. Some of the licenses recorded between October 2000, when our business model was 35 Table of Contents implemented, and the end of fiscal year 2006 continued to contribute to subscription revenue on a monthly, ratable basis. As a result, subscription revenue for fiscal year 2006 includes ratably recognized revenue from contracts recorded in fiscal year 2006, as well as contracts recorded between October 2000 and the end of fiscal year 2005, depending on contract length. Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 increased $251 million from fiscal year 2005, to $2.84 billion. This increase was predominantly due to a $118 million increase in ratably recognized revenue from the indirect business plus the increase in subscription revenue as a result of renewals of contracts whose revenue was previously recognized on an up front basis or as part of maintenance fees under our prior business model. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, we added new deferred subscription value related to our direct business of $2.61 billion and $3.49 billion, respectively. The $0.88 billion decrease in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 in new deferred subscription value was primarily due to the decrease in early contract renewals resulting from the transition away from a total bookings based compensation structure. In addition, CA signed contract extensions with two customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 that added approximately $390 million in aggregate to new deferred subscription value in the period. We also recorded $195 million of new deferred subscription value for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 related to our indirect business, which increased 35% from the $144 million added in the prior fiscal year. Licenses executed under our business model for our direct business had weighted average durations of 3.03 years and 3.10 years, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Annualized new deferred subscription value represents the total value of all new software license agreements entered into during a period divided by the weighted average life of all such license agreements recorded during the same period. The annualized new deferred subscription value for the subscriptions booked in the direct business during the fiscal year 2006 decreased approximately $266 million, or 24% from the comparable prior fiscal year to approximately $861 million. Subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 increased $474 million from fiscal year 2004, to $2.59 billion. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, we added new deferred subscription value related to our direct business of $3.49 billion and $2.29 billion, respectively. Licenses executed under our business model in the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 had weighted average durations of 3.1 and 2.8 years, respectively. Annualized deferred subscription value related to our direct business increased approximately $301 million, or 36%, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 over the comparable prior fiscal year to $1.13 billion. In addition, we recorded $144 million of new deferred subscription value for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 related to our indirect business. Subscription revenue was further increased as a result of renewals of contracts whose revenue was previously recognized on an up front basis or as part of maintenance fees under our prior business model. Under the prior business model, maintenance revenue was separately identified and was reported on the Maintenance line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under our business model, maintenance that is bundled with product sales is not separately identified in our customers license agreements and therefore is included within the Subscription revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under the prior business model, financing revenue was also separately identified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Under our business model, financing fees are no longer applicable and the entire contract value is now recognized as subscription revenue over the term of the contract. The quantification of the impact that each of these factors had on the increase in subscription revenue is not determinable. Maintenance Maintenance revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 decreased $11 million, or 3%, from the comparable prior year to $430 million. This decrease in maintenance revenue is a result of our transition to, and increased number of license agreements under, our business model, where maintenance revenue is bundled along with license revenue, and is reported on the Subscription revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The combined maintenance and license revenue on these types of license agreements is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement under our business model. We cannot quantify the impact that our transition to the new business model had on maintenance revenue since maintenance bundled with software licenses under our business model is not separately identifiable. Maintenance revenue from our indirect business declined $5 million 36 Table of Contents from the comparable prior period to $54 million. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $49 million associated with acquisitions completed prior to March 31, 2006. Maintenance revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 decreased $79 million, or 15% from the prior year predominantly due to the transition of maintenance only licenses to subscription licenses, partially offset by a $36 million increase in maintenance revenue from the indirect business from the comparable prior period to $59 million. Software Fees and Other Software fees and other revenue consist of revenue related to distribution and OEM channel partners (sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue) that has been recorded on an up front sell through basis, revenue associated with acquisitions prior to the transition to our business model, revenue from joint ventures, royalty revenues and other revenue. Revenue related to acquisitions is initially recorded on the acquired companys systems generally under a perpetual or up front model, and is typically converted to our ratable model within the first fiscal year after the acquisition. As these contracts are renewed under our business model, revenue is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the agreement. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, software fees and other revenue decreased $92 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, to $162 million. This reduction is due to a $53 million decrease in prior business model revenue, as ratable revenue from new business model contracts was recorded as subscription revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, we experienced a decrease in indirect revenue associated with the transition to our subscription model in July 2004 which represented a $50 million reduction from the prior year as more revenue was deferred as these indirect contracts were renewed. These decreases were offset by other revenue increases of approximately $11 million. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, software fees and other revenue decreased $77 million from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, to $254 million. This reduction is due to the decrease in indirect revenue associated with the transition to our subscription model in July 2004 which represented a $128 million reduction from the prior year as more revenues were deferred as the contracts were renewed. These decreases were partially offset by approximately $21 million of license revenue associated with the sale of Netegrity products, an approximate $10 million benefit associated with the resolution of a prior business model contract dispute in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and approximately $20 million due to other activities. Financing Fees Financing fees result from the initial discounting to present value of product sales with extended payment terms under the prior business model, which required up front revenue recognition. This discount initially reduced the related installment accounts receivable and is referred to as Unamortized discounts. The related unamortized discount is amortized over the life of the applicable license agreement and is reported as financing fees. Under our business model, additional unamortized discounts are no longer recorded, since we no longer recognize revenue on an up front basis for sales of products with extended payment terms. As expected, for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, financing fees continued to decline, reflecting a decrease of $32 million and $57 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $45 million and $77 million, respectively. The decrease in financing fee revenue for both years is attributable to the discontinuance of offering license agreements under the prior business model and is expected to decline to zero over the next several years. Professional Services Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2006 increased $77 million from fiscal year 2005 to $321 million. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in professional service engagements relating to acquired companies of $23 million, growth in security software which utilize our Access Control and Identity Management solutions, growth in our IT Service and Asset Management engagements and project and portfolio management services. Professional services revenue for fiscal year 2005 increased $10 million from fiscal year 2004 to $244 million. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in security software engagements, which utilize Access Control and 37 Table of Contents Identity Management solutions, as well as growth in IT Service and Asset Management solutions. The increase was also partially attributable to approximately $4 million of services revenue associated with the sale of Netegrity products. This increase in services revenue was limited due to an increase in services sold in combination with related software products of approximately $14 million, which requires that such services revenue be recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period. Total Revenue by Geography The following table presents the amount of revenue earned from sales to unaffiliated customers in the United States and international regions and corresponding percentage changes for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2006 Fiscal Year 2005 2006 % 2005 % Change 2005 % 2004 % Change (restated) (restated) (restated) (in millions) United States $ 2,006 53 $ 1,878 52 7 % $ 1,878 52 $ 1,766 53 6 % International 1,790 47 1,725 48 4 % 1,725 48 1,566 47 10 % $ 3,796 100 $ 3,603 100 5 % $ 3,603 100 $ 3,332 100 8 % International revenue increased $65 million, or 4%, in fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005, primarily due to increased new deferred subscription value in prior periods associated with our European business partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately $17 million. The increase in revenue from the United States was primarily attributable to sales of products related to companies acquired during the fiscal year 2006, an increase in new deferred subscription value in prior periods as well as an increase in professional services revenue, partially offset by decreases in revenue from maintenance, finance fees and software fees and other revenues. International revenue increased $159 million, or 10%, in fiscal year 2005 as compared with fiscal year 2004. The increase in international revenue was primarily attributable to a positive impact to revenue from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $103 million for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004. The increase in foreign currency exchange is primarily associated with the strengthening of both the euro and the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. The increase was also a result of an increase in contract bookings in prior periods associated with our European business. The increase in revenue from the United States was primarily attributable to an increase in contract booking in prior periods as well as an increase in professional services revenue. The increase was partially offset by decreases in revenue from maintenance, finance fees and software fees and other revenues. Price changes and inflation did not have a material impact in fiscal years 2006, 2005 or 2004. 38 Table of Contents Expenses The following table presents expenses as a percentage of total revenue and the percentage of period over period dollar change for the expense line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. These comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results. Fiscal Year 2006 Fiscal Year 2005 Percentage Percentage of of Percentage of Dollar Percentage of Dollar Total Change Total Change Revenue 2006/ Revenue 2005/ 2006 2005 2005 2005 2004 2004 (restated) (restated) (restated) Operating expenses: Amortization of capitalized software costs 12 % 12 % 12 % 14 % (3 )% Cost of professional services 7 % 6 % 18 % 6 % 7 % 2 % Selling, general, and administrative 42 % 38 % 18 % 38 % 40 % 3 % Product development and enhancements 18 % 20 % (2 )% 20 % 21 % 1 % Commissions, royalties and bonuses 10 % 9 % 16 % 9 % 8 % 27 % Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets 4 % 4 % 3 % 4 % 4 % (3 )% Other gains/expenses, net 2 % N/A Restructuring and other 2 % 1 % 214 % 1 % N/A Charge for in process research and development costs Shareholder litigation and government investigation settlements 6 % N/A 6 % 5 % 39% Total operating expenses 96 % 96 % 5 % 96 % 100 % 4% Interest expense, net 1 % 3 % (61 )% 3 % 4 % (9 )% Note Amounts may not add to their respective totals due to rounding. Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and internally generated capitalized software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software development costs are related to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage. Amortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 increased $2 million and decreased $16 million, respectively, from the prior fiscal years to $449 million and $447 million, respectively. The increase in 2006 was predominantly due to the Companys current year acquisitions. The decrease in 2005 was primarily due to certain purchased software assets becoming fully amortized in 2005. We recorded amortization of purchased software products for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 of $401 million, $406 million, and $423 million, respectively. We recorded amortization of internally generated capitalized software development costs for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 of $48 million, $41 million, and $40 million, respectively. Cost of Professional Services Cost of professional services consists primarily of the personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2006 increased $42 million from fiscal year 2005 to $272 million, mostly due to increased sales of professional services. The 39 Table of Contents improvement in professional services gross margin from 6% in fiscal year 2005 to 15% in fiscal year 2006 is attributable to a more effective utilization of professional staff and increased professional services revenue. Cost of professional services for fiscal year 2005 increased $5 million from fiscal year 2004 to $230 million mostly due to increased revenue volume, partially offset by approximately $12 million of costs required to be deferred because they were sold in combination with related software products, which requires that the total estimated cost of such services be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the related software contract period. Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2006 increased $244 million from fiscal year 2005 to $1.60 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to employee and other costs associated with the Concord, Niku, iLumin, and Wily acquisitions of approximately $98 million, increased travel, training and relocation costs of approximately $39 million, increased consulting costs of approximately $55 million related to our ERP implementation, legal fees, Sarbanes Oxley compliance programs, and increased marketing and promotion costs of approximately $35 million mostly due to our new branding campaign and channel promotions. Partly offsetting these increases was a reduction of $15 million associated with the Companys decision in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 to forego its discretionary contribution to the Company sponsored 401(k) plan. Through the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company had accrued $12 million, all of which was reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, resulting in a $12 million reduction to SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. SG&A expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 included approximately $64 million and $60 million of stock based compensation expense, respectively. SG&A expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005 included credits to the provision for doubtful accounts of approximately $18 million and $25 million, respectively. The credit in the provision for doubtful accounts is a result of the reduction in the prior business model accounts receivable. Under our business model, amounts due from customers are offset by related deferred subscription revenue, resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet. In addition, under our business model, customer payments are often received in advance of revenue recognition, which results in a reduced net credit exposure. Each of these items reduces the need to provide for estimated bad debts. SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2005 increased $35 million from fiscal year 2004 to $1.35 billion. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs. SG&A expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 included approximately $60 million and $77 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense. In addition, in fiscal year 2005 we recorded a credit of approximately $25 million against the provision of doubtful accounts, which is lower than the credit of $53 million we recorded in fiscal year 2004. SG&A for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004 also included approximately $24 million and $30 million, respectively, of legal expenses related to the government investigation and, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, included $31 million for consulting and other fees associated with our Sarbanes Oxley compliance program. Further, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, we realized a gain of approximately $8 million on the sale of an investment that was included in SG&A. Product Development and Enhancements For fiscal year 2006, product development and enhancement expenditures, which include product support, decreased $11 million compared to fiscal year 2005 to $697 million. Product development and enhancement expenditures were approximately 18% and 20% of total revenue for fiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During fiscal year 2006, we continued to focus on and invest in product development and enhancements for emerging technologies such as wireless, Web services and on demand computing, as well as a broadening of our enterprise product offerings. Product development and enhancement expenditures for fiscal year 2005 increased $5 million from fiscal year 2004 to $708 million. Product development and enhancement expenditures were approximately 20% and 21% of total revenue for fiscal years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Commissions, Royalties and Bonuses Commissions, royalties and bonuses for fiscal year 2006 increased $55 million from fiscal year 2005 to $394 million. Sales commission expense increased approximately $36 million over the prior year, and was approximately $75 million more than the Company had anticipated at the outset of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. The increase was primarily due to a new sales commission plan for fiscal year 2006 that did not appropriately align commission payments with our overall performance. The impact of the higher sales commission expense was partially offset by lower bonus expenses in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 of approximately $8 million, primarily due to the reductions in our variable compensation programs, including management bonuses. Through the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company had accrued approximately $26 million in annual bonus expense, of which approximately $10 million was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2006. We are restating our third quarter results and have identified a material weakness in financial controls as they pertained to the fiscal year 2006 commissions plan. Refer to Part 1, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures for additional information concerning the evaluation of the Companys internal control processes over the recognition of commission expense. Royalties also increased over the prior year by approximately $25 million primarily due to an increased level of royalties associated with recent acquisitions, royalties associated with the newly formed Ingres Corporation as well as higher sales of certain royalty bearing channel products. Commissions, royalties and bonuses for fiscal year 2005 increased $72 million from fiscal year 2004 to $339 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in new deferred subscription value recorded in fiscal year 2005, on which sales commissions were based, as compared with fiscal year 2004. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal year 2006 increased $4 million from fiscal year 2005 to $134 million. The increase in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets acquired during the year, resulting from recent acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal year 2005 decreased $4 million from fiscal year 2004 to $130 million. The decrease in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets was a result of certain intangible assets from past acquisitions becoming fully amortized. Other (Gains)/Expenses, Net Gains and losses attributable to divestitures of fixed assets, certain foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and certain other infrequent events have been included in the Other (gains)/expenses, net line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The components of Other (gains)/expenses, net are as follows: Year Ended March 31, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Gains attributable to divestitures of fixed assets $ (7 ) $ $ (19 ) Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (9 ) 8 41 (Gains) expenses attributable to legal settlements 1 (13 ) 26 Impairment of capitalized software 4 Total $ (15 ) $ (5 ) $ 52 Restructuring and Other In the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, we announced a restructuring plan designed to more closely align our investments with strategic growth opportunities, including a workforce reduction of approximately 5% or 800 positions worldwide. The plan is expected to yield about $75 million in savings on an annualized basis, once the reductions are fully implemented. We anticipate the total restructuring plan will cost up to $85 million. As of March 31, 2006, we have incurred approximately $66 million of expenses under the plan of which $45 million of these expenses remain unpaid at March 31, 2006. The remaining liability balance is included in Accrued expenses and other current 41 Table of Contents liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Final payment of these amounts is dependent upon settlement with the works councils in certain international locations and our ability to negotiate lease terminations. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we incurred approximately $15 million in connection with certain DPA related costs and the termination of a non core application development professional services project (see also Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and other expenses. In addition, as part of its restructuring initiatives and associated review of the benefits of owning versus leasing certain properties, the Company also entered into three sale/leaseback transactions during the second half of fiscal year 2006. Two of these transactions resulted in a loss totaling approximately $7 million which was recorded under Restructuring and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The third sale/leaseback transaction resulted in a gain of approximately $5 million which is being recognized ratably as a reduction to rent expense over the life of the lease term. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we announced a restructuring plan that was designed to more closely align our investments with strategic growth opportunities. The restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 5% or 750 positions worldwide, slightly lower than our original estimate of 800 positions. As of March 31, 2005, the Company had made all payments under the plan. Shareholder Litigation and Government Investigation Settlement In prior fiscal years, a number of stockholder class action lawsuits were initiated that alleged, among other things, that the Company made misleading statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in connection with the Companys financial performance. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the shareholder litigation. In August 2003, we announced the settlement of all outstanding litigation related to these actions. Under the settlement, we agreed to issue a total of up to 5.7 million shares of common stock to the shareholders represented in the three class action lawsuits, including payment of attorneys fees. In January 2004, approximately 1.6 million settlement shares were issued along with approximately $3.3 million to the plaintiffs attorneys for attorney fees and related expenses. In March 2004, approximately 0.2 million settlement shares were issued to participants and beneficiaries of the CASH Plan. On October 8, 2004, the Federal Court signed an order approving the distribution of the remaining 3.8 million settlement shares, less administrative expenses. All the remaining shareholder litigation settlement shares were issued in December 2004. Of the 3.8 million settlement shares, approximately 51,000 were used for the payment of administrative expenses in connection with the settlement, approximately 76,000 were liquidated for cash distributions to class members entitled to receive a cash distribution, and the remaining settlement shares were distributed to class members entitled to receive a distribution of shares. The final shareholder litigation settlement value of approximately $174 million was calculated using the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) closing price of our common stock on December 14, 2004, the date the settlement shares were issued, and also included certain administrative costs associated with the settlement. An initial estimate for the value of the shareholder litigation settlement was established on August 22, 2003. The chart below summarizes the NYSE closing price of our common stock and the estimated value of the shareholder litigation settlement since the initial estimate was established. Shareholder NYSE Closing Litigation Settlement Stock Price Estimated Value (in millions) December 14, 2004 $ 31.03 $ 174 September 30, 2004 26.30 156 June 30, 2004 28.06 163 March 31, 2004 26.86 158 December 31, 2003 27.34 158 September 30, 2003 26.11 150 August 22, 2003 25.00 144 42 Table of Contents The shareholder litigation settlement expense for fiscal year 2005 of $16 million was a result of the increase in our stock price since March 31, 2004. The aggregate shareholder litigation settlement expense recorded was $174 million, including $158 million in fiscal year 2004. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In September 2004, we reached agreements with the USAO and the SEC in connection with their investigations of improper recognition of revenue and related reporting practices during the period January 1, 1998 through September 30, 2000, and the actions of certain former employees to impede the investigations. Under the DPA, we agreed, among other things, to establish a restitution fund of $225 million to compensate present and former Company shareholders for losses caused by the misconduct of certain former Company executives. In connection with the DPA, we recorded a $10 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 and $218 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 associated with the establishment of the shareholder restitution fund and related administrative fees. The first payment of $75 million was made during the third quarter of fiscal year 2005. The second payment of $75 million was made in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and the final payment of $75 million was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net for fiscal year 2006 decreased $65 million as compared to fiscal year 2005 to $41 million. The change was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding which resulted in a $39 million decrease in interest expense, and a decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt, which resulted in a $20 million decrease in interest expense. The decrease was also due to an increase in our average cash balance and an increase in interest rates on the cash balance during the fiscal year ended 2006 as compared to the fiscal year ended 2005, which resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $6 million. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A and Note 6, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Interest expense, net for fiscal year 2005 decreased $11 million as compared to fiscal year 2004 to $106 million. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in our average cash balance during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004, which resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $28 million. The decrease in interest expense was partially reduced by additional interest expense of $8 million incurred as a result of the issuance of the 2005 Senior Notes and an increase in the weighted average interest rate, which resulted in a $9 million increase in interest expense. Operating Margins Fiscal year 2006 pretax operating income from continuing operations was $121 million as compared to $33 million in fiscal year 2005. This improvement relates primarily to revenue growth as a result of our acquisitions, and $234 million in shareholder litigation and government investigation costs in fiscal year 2005 that did not recur in fiscal year 2006, partially offset by higher restructuring costs and higher selling, general and administrative costs and commission expenses incurred in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately (29%), 21%, and 23% for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Refer to Note 8, Income Taxes, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The income tax benefit recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 includes benefits of approximately $51 million arising from the recognition of certain foreign tax credits, $18 million arising from international stock based compensation deductions and $66 million arising from foreign export benefits and other international tax rate benefits. Partially offsetting these benefits was a charge of approximately $46 million related to additional tax reserves. 43 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we repatriated approximately $584 million from foreign subsidiaries. Total taxes related to the repatriation were approximately $55 million. The repatriation was initially planned in fiscal year 2005 in response to the favorable tax benefits afforded by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), which introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, provided that certain criteria were met. During fiscal year 2005, we recorded an estimate of this tax charge of $55 million based on an estimated repatriation amount up to $500 million. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we recorded a benefit of approximately $36 million reflecting the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Notice 2005 38 issued on May 10, 2005. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company finalized its estimates of tax liabilities and determined that an adjustment was necessary and, accordingly, recorded an additional tax charge in the amount of $36 million. As a result of this complex tax matter, the Company has identified a material weakness in its internal controls over documenting and communicating tax planning strategies. See Item 9A, Controls and Procedures for additional information. In May 2004, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2004 34, Changes in Accounting Periods and in Methods of Accounting, which grants taxpayers a twelve month deferral for cash received from customers to the extent such receipts were not recognized in revenue for financial statement purposes. Therefore, taxes associated with cash collected from U.S. customers in advance of the ratable recognition of revenue for certain licenses are deferred for up to one year. As a result of implementing this revenue procedure, we reduced deferred tax assets and income taxes payable by approximately $73 million and $159 million as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes in fiscal year 2005 was approximately $12 million, which was lower than the amount we historically paid for incomes taxes primarily due to the new IRS revenue procedure. The income tax expense for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 includes a charge of $55 million reflecting the Companys original estimated cost of repatriating approximately $500 million under the AJCA which was partially offset by a $26 million tax benefit attributable to a refund claim originally made for additional tax benefits associated with prior fiscal years. We received a letter from the IRS approving the claim for this refund in September 2004.

In fiscal year 2006, the Company repatriated approximately $584 million in cash to the United States in order to avail itself of the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The aggregate amount of taxes related to the repatriation was approximately $55 million. Sources and Uses of Cash Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.87 billion on March 31, 2006, a decrease of $1.26 billion from the March 31, 2005 balance of $3.13 billion. Cash generated from continuing operations was $1.38 billion and represented the Companys primary source of liquidity in fiscal year 2006. This cash generated was primarily used to fund acquisitions, repay debt and repurchase common shares. In fiscal year 2006, cash provided by continuing operating activities was positively impacted by a decrease of receivable cycles and an increase of payable cycles. During the quarter ended September 30, 2005, the Company undertook a review of its accounts receivable and accounts payable collection/payment cycles and determined that improvements in each could be made. The improvements associated with accounts receivable were related principally to improved collection procedures, including an increased emphasis on obtaining payment of initial customer invoices at the time of contract signing. Management believes that these improvements are sustainable but any further improvements in the accounts receivable collection cycle will not materially impact liquidity in future years. The increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $106 million was principally related to a concerted effort to make payments to vendors on an extended basis. Management has determined that its payables cycle has exceeded an optimal level and that it should be reduced. Therefore, the Company expects a reduction in the level of days payable outstanding, which will likely have an adverse effect on future cash provided by operating activities, particularly in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. Under both the prior business model and current business model, customers generally pay for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement. We refer to these payments as installment payments. While the transition to the current business model has changed the timing of revenue recognition, in most cases it has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers. As a result, our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the transition to the current business model over the past several years. We do not expect any significant changes in our cash generated from operations as a result of this transition. The timing and amount of installment payments committed under any specific license agreement is often the result of negotiations with the customer and can vary from year to year. In fiscal year 2006, our cash provided by continuing operations was positively impacted by certain arrangements under which the entire contract value or a substantial portion of the contract value was due in one single installment upon execution of the agreement, rather than being invoiced on an annual basis over the life of the contract. Upon receipt, these amounts are reflected as increases in deferred subscription revenue (collected) in the liability section of the balance sheet. Deferred subscription revenue (collected), both current and non current, of $1.96 billion at March 31, 2006 increased approximately $280 million, compared to $1.68 billion at March 31, 2005. The increase of the non current portion, from $273 million to $448 million, was primarily related to these types of arrangements, approximately half of which related to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. As previously noted, collections of these amounts positively impact current year cash flows provided from operating activities and collections that would have been attributable to later years (i.e. the non current portion) will not be available as a source of cash in such later years as the revenue is recognized. Although we cannot predict with certainty the amount of future license agreements that will be executed with similar payment terms, we expect the aggregate dollar value of these arrangements to decline in fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. The Companys estimate of the fair value of net installment accounts receivable recorded under the prior business model approximates carrying value. Amounts due from customers under our business model are offset by deferred subscription value related to these license agreements, leaving no or minimal net carrying value on the balance sheet for such amounts. The fair value of such amounts may exceed this carrying value but cannot be practically assessed since there is no existing market for a pool of customer receivables with contractual commitments similar to those 46 Table of Contents owned by us. The actual fair value may not be known until these amounts are sold, securitized, or collected. Although these customer license agreements commit the customer to payment under a fixed schedule, the agreements are considered executory in nature due to the ongoing commitment to provide unspecified future upgrades as part of the agreement terms. Under our business model, we can estimate the total amounts to be billed and or collected at the conclusion of a reporting period. For current business model contracts, amounts we expect to bill within the next fiscal year at March 31, 2006, declined by $0.11 billion to approximately $1.68 billion from the prior year. Amounts we expect to bill for periods after 12 months declined by $0.45 billion to $1.24 billion. These declines are due to a combination of the accelerated payments noted above and the timing of the renewal of existing contracts. The estimated amounts expected to be collected and a reconciliation of such amounts to the amounts we recorded as accounts receivable are as follows: Reconciliation of Amounts to be Collected to Accounts Receivable March 31, March 31, 2006 2005 (restated) (in millions) Current: Accounts receivable $ 828 $ 794 Other receivables 77 39 Amounts to be billed within the next 12 months business model 1,680 1,794 Amounts to be billed within the next 12 months prior business model 254 391 Less: allowance for doubtful accounts (25 ) (35 ) Net amounts expected to be collected current 2,814 2,983 Less: Unamortized discounts (44 ) (62 ) Unearned maintenance (4 ) (23 ) Deferred subscription revenue current, billed (534 ) (314 ) Deferred subscription value current, uncollected (476 ) (661 ) Deferred subscription value noncurrent, uncollected, related to current accounts receivable (1,204 ) (1,133 ) Unearned professional services (47 ) (14 ) Trade and installment accounts receivable current, net 505 776 Non Current: Amounts to be billed beyond the next 12 months business model 1,236 1,698 Amounts to be billed beyond the next 12 months prior business model 511 759 Less: allowance for doubtful accounts (20 ) (53 ) Net amounts expected to be collected noncurrent 1,727 2,404 Less: Unamortized discounts (34 ) (79 ) Unearned maintenance (8 ) (32 ) Deferred subscription value noncurrent, uncollected (1,236 ) (1,698 ) Installment accounts receivable noncurrent, net 449 595 Total accounts receivable, net $ 954 $ 1,371 47 Table of Contents March 31, March 31, 2006 2005 (restated) (in millions) Deferred Subscription Value: Deferred subscription revenue (collected) current $ 1,517 $ 1,407 Deferred subscription revenue (collected) noncurrent 448 273 Deferred subscription revenue current, billed 534 314 Deferred subscription value current, uncollected 476 661 Deferred subscription value noncurrent, uncollected, related to current accounts receivable 1,204 1,133 Deferred subscription value noncurrent, uncollected 1,236 1,698 Aggregate deferred subscription value balance $ 5,415 $ 5,486 Approximately 11% of the total deferred subscription value balance of approximately $5.42 billion at March 31, 2006 is associated with multi year contracts signed with the U.S. Federal Government and other U.S. state and local governmental agencies that are generally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and or may be terminated at the convenience of the government. While funding under these contracts is not assured, we do not believe any circumstances exist which might indicate that such funding will not be approved and paid in accordance with the terms of our contracts. For any contracts with governmental agencies who are first time customers that are subject to annual fiscal funding approval, we generally do not record the deferred subscription value for the unbilled portion of the contract until the funding is approved. We also receive contracts from non U.S. governmental agencies that contain similar provisions. The total balance of deferred subscription value related to non U.S. governmental agencies that may be terminated at the convenience of the agencies is not material to the overall deferred subscription value balance. Unbilled amounts under the Companys business model are collectible over one to five years. As of March 31, 2006, on a cumulative basis, approximately 58%, 87%, 97%, 99% and 100% of amounts due from customers recorded under the Companys business model come due within fiscal years ended 2007 through 2011, respectively. Unbilled amounts under the prior business model are collectible over three to six years. As of March 31, 2006, on a cumulative basis, approximately 33%, 53%, 68%, 82% and 94% of amounts due from customers recorded under the prior business model come due within fiscal years ended 2007 through 2011, respectively. Fiscal Year 2006 compared to Fiscal Year 2005 Operating Activities Cash generated from continuing operating activities for fiscal year 2006 of $1.38 billion declined by approximately 10% compared to the prior years cash from continuing operations of $1.53 billion. The decrease in cash generated from continuing operations was the result of several factors. The Company experienced an increase of approximately $254 million in collections on accounts receivable compared to the prior year. This increase was more than offset by year over year increases in payments for taxes of approximately $195 million, incremental restitution fund payments of $75 million, and higher payments to vendors and employees of approximately $165 million. The level of payments to vendors in the current year was favorably impacted by the Companys concerted effort to extend payment terms. In fiscal year 2006, the Company experienced an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately $106 million, compared to the prior year which experienced a decrease of $141 million. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was approximately $847 million compared to $740 million in the prior year. The change in cash from investing activities primarily relates to $1.01 billion of cash used to fund recent acquisitions. Partly offsetting the cash used for acquisitions was $398 million in cash received from the sales of marketable securities. In addition, the Company also entered into three sale/leaseback transactions during the second half of 48 Table of Contents fiscal year 2006, due to our restructuring initiatives and our associated review of the benefits of owning versus leasing certain properties. Total cash realized from these transactions was approximately $75 million. All of these transactions were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 28, Accounting for Sales with Leasebacks an amendment of FASB Statement No. 13. Financing Activities The primary use of cash for financing activities has been the repayment of debt and the repurchase of common stock, as discussed above. As of March 31, 2006 and 2005, our debt arrangements consisted of the following: 2006 2005 Maximum Outstanding Maximum Outstanding Available Balance Available Balance (in millions) Debt Arrangements 2004 Revolving Credit Facility (expires December 2008) $ 1,000 $ $ 1,000 $ 6.375% Senior Notes due April 2005 825 6.500% Senior Notes due April 2008 350 350 4.750% Senior Notes due December 2009 500 500 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009 460 460 5.625% Senior Notes due December 2014 500 500 Other 1 1 Total $ 1,811 $ 2,636 At March 31, 2006, we had $1.81 billion in debt and $1.87 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our net liquidity position was approximately $54 million. Additionally, we reported restricted cash balances of $60 million and $67 million at March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which were included in the Other noncurrent assets line item. In April 2005, we repaid, as scheduled, the $825 million 6.375% Senior Notes issued during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999 using our available cash balances (see Fiscal Year 1999 Senior Notes for details). During fiscal year 2005, we issued $1 billion of senior notes and redeemed approximately $660 million in outstanding debt compared to a net debt reduction of approximately $826 million in fiscal year 2004. 2004 Revolving Credit Facility In December 2004, we entered into a new unsecured, revolving credit facility (the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility). The maximum committed amount available under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility is $1 billion, exclusive of incremental credit increases of up to an additional $250 million which are available subject to certain conditions and the agreement of our lenders. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility expires December 2008 and no amount was drawn as of March 31, 2006 or March 31, 2005. Refer to Note 6, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate dependent on our credit ratings at the time of such borrowings and will be calculated according to a base rate or a Eurocurrency rate, as the case may be, plus an applicable margin and utilization fee. Depending on our credit rating at the time of borrowing, the applicable margin can range from 0% to 0.325% for a base rate borrowing and from 0.50% to 1.325% for a Eurocurrency borrowing, and the utilization fee can range from 0.125% to 0.250%. At our current credit ratings in July 2006, the applicable margin would be 0.025% for a base rate borrowing and 1.025% for a Eurocurrency borrowing, and the utilization fee would be 0.125%. In addition, we must pay facility fees quarterly at rates dependent on our credit ratings. The facility fees can range from 0.125% to 0.30% of the aggregate amount of each lenders full revolving credit commitment (without taking into account any outstanding borrowings under such 49 Table of Contents commitments). At our credit ratings in July 2006, the facility fee is 0.225% of the aggregate amount of each lenders revolving credit commitment. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants for transactions of this type, including two financial covenants: (i) for the 12 months ending each quarter end, the ratio of consolidated debt for borrowed money to consolidated cash flow, each as defined in the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, must not exceed 3.25 for the quarter ending December 31, 2004 and 2.75 for quarters ending March 31, 2005 and thereafter; and (ii) for the 12 months ending each quarter end, the ratio of consolidated cash flow to the sum of interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, all consolidated debt for borrowed money, as defined in the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, must not be less than 5.00. In addition, as a condition precedent to each borrowing made under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, as of the date of such borrowing, (i) no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) we are to reaffirm that the representations and warranties made in the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility (other than the representation with respect to material adverse changes, but including the representation regarding the absence of certain material litigation) are correct. On June 29, 2006, we obtained a waiver from all participating banks under the credit facility to file our financial statements within the 90 day required period. The waiver extends this period through August 28, 2006. Upon the filing of this Form 10 K we believe we are in compliance with our debt covenants. Fiscal Year 1999 Senior Notes In fiscal year 1999, the Company issued $1.75 billion of unsecured Senior Notes in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (Rule 144A). Amounts borrowed, rates, and maturities for each issue were $575 million at 6.25% due April 15, 2003, $825 million at 6.375% due April 15, 2005, and $350 million at 6.5% due April 15, 2008. In April 2005, the Company repaid the $825 million remaining balance of the 6.375% Senior Notes from available cash balances. As of March 31, 2006, $350 million of the 6.5% Senior Notes remained outstanding. Fiscal Year 2005 Senior Notes In November 2004, the Company issued an aggregate of $1 billion of unsecured Senior Notes (2005 Senior Notes) in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A. The Company issued $500 million of 4.75%, 5 year notes due December 2009 and $500 million of 5.625%, 10 year notes due December 2014. The Company has the option to redeem the 2005 Senior Notes at any time, at redemption prices equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series being redeemed and (ii) the present value of the principal and interest payable over the life of the 2005 Senior Notes, discounted at a rate equal to 15 basis points and 20 basis points for the 5 year notes and 10 year notes, respectively, over a comparable U.S. Treasury bond yield. The maturity of the 2005 Senior Notes may be accelerated by the holders upon certain events of default, including failure to make payments when due and failure to comply with covenants in the 2005 Senior Notes. The 5 year notes were issued at a price equal to 99.861% of the principal amount and the 10 year notes at a price equal to 99.505% of the principal amount for resale under Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Company also agreed for the benefit of the holders to register the 2005 Senior Notes under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to a registered exchange offer so that the 2005 Senior Notes may be sold in the public market. Because the Company did not meet certain deadlines for completion of the exchange offer, the interest rate on the 2005 Senior Notes increased by 25 basis points as of September 27, 2005 and increased by an additional 25 basis points as of December 26, 2005 since the delay was not cured prior to that date. After the delay is cured, such additional interest on the 2005 Senior Notes will no longer be payable. The Company expects to register the 2005 Senior Notes in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. The Company used the net proceeds from this issuance to repay debt as described above. 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes In fiscal year 2003, the Company issued $460 million of unsecured 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes (1.625% Notes), due December 15, 2009, in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A. The 1.625% Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with all existing senior unsecured indebtedness. Concurrent with the issuance of the 1.625% Notes, we entered into call spread repurchase option transactions to partially mitigate potential dilution from conversion of the 1.625% Notes. For further information, refer to Note 6, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 Table of Contents 3% Concord Convertible Notes In connection with our acquisition of Concord in June 2005, we assumed $86 million in 3% convertible senior notes due 2023. In accordance with the notes terms, we redeemed (for cash) the notes in full in July 2005. International Line of Credit An unsecured and uncommitted multi currency line of credit is available to meet short term working capital needs for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States. The line of credit is available on an offering basis, meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions, including interest rate, maturity, representations, covenants and events of default, as mutually agreed between our subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction. As of March 31, 2006, this line totaled approximately $5 million and approximately $3 million was pledged in support of bank guarantees. Amounts drawn under these facilities as of March 31, 2006 were minimal. In addition to the above facility, our foreign subsidiaries use guarantees issued by commercial banks to guarantee performance on certain contracts. At March 31, 2006 the aggregate amount of significant guarantees outstanding was approximately $5 million, none of which had been drawn down by third parties. Share Repurchases, Stock Option Exercises and Dividends We repurchased approximately $590 million of common stock in connection with our publicly announced corporate buyback program in fiscal year 2006 compared with $161 million in fiscal year 2005; we received approximately $97 million in proceeds resulting from the exercise of Company stock options in fiscal year 2006 compared with $73 million in fiscal year 2005; and we paid dividends of $93 million, $47 million and $47 million in each of the fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As announced in April 2005, beginning in fiscal year 2006 we increased our annual cash dividend to $0.16 per share, which was paid out in quarterly installments of $0.04 per share as and when declared by the Board of Directors. On June 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion common stock repurchase plan for fiscal year 2007 which will replace the $600 million common stock repurchase plan announced in March 2006. We expect to finance the stock repurchase plan through a combination of cash on hand and bank financing. Effect of Exchange Rate Changes There was a negative $63 million impact to our cash flows in fiscal year 2006 predominantly due to the weakening of the British pound and the euro against the dollar of approximately 8% and 6%, respectively. In fiscal year 2005, we had a $47 million favorable impact to our cash flows predominantly due to a strengthening of the pound and euro of approximately 3% and 5%, respectively. Other Matters At March 31, 2006, our senior unsecured notes were rated Ba1, BBB , and BBB and were on positive, negative and stable outlook by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively. In June 2006, our senior unsecured notes ratings remained at Ba1, BBB, and BBB by Moodys, S&P and Fitch, respectively, all with a negative outlook. Following the announcement of the delayed filing of our Form 10 K beyond its extended due date of June 29, 2006 and the announcement of our $2 billion stock buy back program, S&P and Fitch downgraded our ratings to BB and BB+, respectively. As of July 2006, Moodys has placed us under review for possible downgrade, the outlook from Fitch is negative and S&P has placed our notes on CreditWatch with negative implications. Peak borrowings under all debt facilities during the fiscal year 2006 totaled approximately $2.64 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.9%. In March 2005, we pre funded contributions to the CA Savings Harvest Plan, a 401(k) plan. The Company elected not to pre fund its contribution in March 2006 as a result of IRS Treasury Regulations eliminating the tax benefit associated with the pre funding of elective and matching contributions. 51 Table of Contents Capital resource requirements as of March 31, 2006 consisted of lease obligations for office space, equipment, mortgage and loan obligations, our ERP implementation, and amounts due as a result of product and company acquisitions. Refer to Contractual Obligations and Commitments for additional information. It is expected that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines and in the capital markets, and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. We expect our long standing history of providing extended payment terms to our customers to continue. We expect to use existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund financing activities such as the repayment of our debt balances as they mature as well as the repurchase of shares of common stock and the payment of dividends as approved by our Board of Directors. Cash generated will also be used for investing activities such as future acquisitions as well as additional capital spending, including our continued investment in our ERP implementation. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have commitments to invest approximately $3 million in connection with joint venture agreements. Prior to fiscal year 2001, we sold individual accounts receivable under the prior business model to a third party subject to certain recourse provisions. The outstanding principal balance subject to recourse of these receivables approximated $146 million and $183 million as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of March 31, 2006, we have not incurred any losses related to these receivables. Other than the commitments and recourse provisions described above, we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and, accordingly, off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with current accounting rules, the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at March 31, 2006 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. In addition, the table summarizes the timing of payments on our debt obligations as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2006. Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 3 3 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (in millions) Contractual Obligations Long term debt obligations (inclusive of interest) $ 2,223 $ 85 $ 506 $ 1,048 $ 584 Operating lease obligations(1) 612 128 186 111 187 Purchase obligations 118 50 37 25 6 Other long term liabilities(2) 78 17 25 14 22 Total $ 3,031 $ 280 $ 754 $ 1,198 $ 799 (1) The contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases include sublease income totaling $93 million expected to be received in the following periods: $25 million (less than 1 year); $40 million (1 3 years); $18 million (3 5 years); and $10 million (more than 5 years). (2) Other long term liabilities primarily relate to operating expenses associated with operating lease obligations. 52 Table of Contents As of March 31, 2006, we have no material capital lease obligations, either individually or in the aggregate. Outlook for Fiscal Year 2007 This outlook contains certain forward looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs and assumptions made by management, as well as information currently available to management. Should business conditions change or should our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described below. We do not intend to update these forward looking statements. The outlook for our fiscal year 2007 is based on the assumption that there will be limited to modest improvement in the current economic and IT environments. We also believe customers will continue to be cautious with their technology purchases. Our preliminary outlook for fiscal year 2007 is to generate revenue of approximately $3.9 billion, earnings per share of approximately $0.44 as calculated on a GAAP basis, and cash generated from operations of $1.3 billion. We expect that: We will incur approximately $105 million (pre tax) in non cash stock based compensation charges in connection with SFAS No. 123(R) (we incurred approximately $99 million of total stock based compensation charges in fiscal year 2006); Cash generated from operations will be negatively impacted by an additional $200 million in tax payments, higher disbursements due to a decline in the days payables cycle and lower collections from contracts with accelerated payment terms; and Our effective tax rate should be approximately 34% in fiscal year 2007. This outlook has not been adjusted to reflect the $2 billion common stock repurchase plan for fiscal year 2007 or the impact of any related financing activities. This outlook also assumes that the Company will take steps to achieve certain cost savings. These steps may have related non operating costs that would have a negative effect on GAAP earnings per share. The Company has not yet identified these savings or quantified their potential impact on GAAP earnings per share, and it is possible that GAAP earnings per share could be lower than the amount included in this outlook. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. We consider the following significant accounting polices to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources: (1) licensing software products; (2) providing customer technical support (referred to as maintenance); and (3) providing professional services, such as consulting and education. We recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Position 97 2 Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97 2), issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as amended by SOP 98 9 Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. In 53 Table of Contents accordance with SOP 97 2, we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software products when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer; (2) we deliver the products; (3) license agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final; and (4) collection is probable. Our software licenses generally do not include acceptance provisions. An acceptance provision allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to license the software. If a license agreement includes an acceptance provision, we do not record deferred subscription value or recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or, if not notified by the customer to cancel the license agreement, the expiration of the acceptance period. Under our business model, software license agreements include flexible contractual provisions that, among other things, allow customers to receive unspecified future software upgrades for no additional fee. These agreements combine the right to use the software product with maintenance for the term of the agreement. Under these agreements, we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning upon completion of the four SOP 97 2 recognition criteria noted above. For license agreements signed prior to October 2000 (the prior business model), once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met, software license fees were recognized as revenue up front, and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license. Maintenance revenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) combined license and maintenance agreements recorded under the prior business model; and (2) stand alone maintenance agreements. Under the prior business model, maintenance and license fees were generally combined into a single license agreement. The maintenance portion was deferred and amortized into revenue over the initial license agreement term. Some of these license agreements have not reached the end of their initial terms and, therefore, continue to amortize. This amortization is recorded on the Maintenance line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The deferred maintenance portion, which was optional to the customer, was determined using its fair value based on annual, fixed maintenance renewal rates stated in the agreement. For license agreements entered into under our current business model, maintenance and license fees continue to be combined; however, the maintenance is inclusive for the entire term. We report such combined fees on the Subscription revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also record stand alone maintenance revenue earned from customers who elect optional maintenance. Revenue from such renewals is recognized as maintenance revenue over the term of the renewal agreement. The Deferred maintenance revenue line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheets principally represents payments received in advance of maintenance services rendered. Revenue from professional service arrangements is recognized pursuant to the provisions of SOP 97 2, which in most cases is as the services are performed. Revenues from professional services that are sold as part of a software transaction are deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the life of the related software transaction. If it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed. Revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and VARs is recognized when all four of the SOP 97 2 revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software product to their customers. This is commonly referred to as the sell through method. Beginning July 1, 2004, sales of our products made by distributors, resellers and VARs to their customers incorporate the right for the end users to receive certain upgraded software products at no additional fee. Accordingly, revenue from those contracts is recognized on a ratable basis. We have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and have a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under such agreements. We assess collectibility based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed through the receipt of cash payment. 54 Table of Contents Our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products. Such warranties are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. Under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements, we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on, among other things, allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. In most cases, in the event of an infringement claim, we retain the right to (i) procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product; (ii) replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be reasonably achieved, we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid. Such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The likelihood that we would be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. In most cases and where legally enforceable, the indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer. Accounts Receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for the potential impairment of accounts receivable on the balance sheet. In developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts, we rely on several factors, including: Historical information, such as general collection history of multi year software agreements; Current customer information/events, such as extended delinquency, requests for restructuring, and filing for bankruptcy; Results of analyzing historical and current data; and The overall macroeconomic environment. The allowance is comprised of two components: (a) specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when, based on current information, we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer; and (b) an allowance for losses inherent in the remaining receivable portfolio based on the analysis of the specifically reviewed receivables. We expect the allowance for doubtful accounts to continue to decline as net installment accounts receivable under the prior business model are billed and collected. Under our business model, amounts due from customers are offset by deferred subscription value (unearned revenue) related to these amounts, resulting in little or no carrying value on the balance sheet. Therefore, a smaller allowance for doubtful accounts is required. Sales Commissions We accrue sales commissions based on, among other things, estimates of how our sales personnel will perform against specified annual sales quotas. These estimates involve assumptions regarding the Companys projected new product sales and billings. All of these assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties, and as a result, if other assumptions had been used in the period, sales commission expense could have been impacted for that period. Under our current sales compensation model, during periods of high growth and sales of new products relative to revenue in that period, the amount of sales commission expense attributable to the license agreement would be recognized fully in the year and could negatively impact income and earnings per share in that period, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year when new contract values are traditionally higher than in the first half. Income Taxes When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We record this amount as a provision for taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction; estimate differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement purposes versus tax return purposes 55 Table of Contents (known as temporary differences), which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities; and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets and net operating losses will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We have recognized as a deferred tax asset a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations. As of March 31, 2006, our gross deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance, totaled $602 million. Realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized. The factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets result from acquisition expenses, such as duplicate facility costs, employee severance and other costs that are not deductible until paid, net operating losses (NOLs) and temporary differences between the taxable cash payments received from customers and the ratable recognition of revenue in accordance with GAAP. The NOLs expire between 2007 and 2026. Additionally, approximately $57 million and $28 million of the valuation allowance as of March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005, respectively, is attributable to acquired NOLs which are subject to annual limitations under IRS Code Section 382. Future results may vary from these estimates. At this time it is not practicable to determine if we will need to increase the valuation allowance or if such future valuations will have a material impact on our financial statements. Goodwill, Capitalized Software Products, and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill. Absent any prior indicators of impairment, we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We performed our annual assessment for fiscal year 2006 and concluded that there were no impairments to record. The SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model is a two step process. The first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test, and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test, is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions. These estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management. This approach uses significant assumptions, including projected future cash flow, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flow, and a terminal growth rate. The carrying value of capitalized software products, both purchased software and internally developed software, and other intangible assets, are reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of internal and external facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of cost for other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date. It is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or, if such an impairment were to occur, the magnitude thereof. 56 Table of Contents Product Development and Enhancements We account for product development and enhancements in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates. If other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility, the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been impacted. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation We currently maintain stock based compensation plans. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain stock based awards. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk free interest rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years. As described in Note 9, Stock Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, performance share units are awards granted under the long term incentive plan for senior executives where the number of shares or restricted shares as applicable, ultimately received by the employee depends on Company performance measured against specified targets and will be determined after a three year or one year period as applicable. The fair value of each award is estimated on the date that the performance targets are established based on the fair value of the Companys stock and the Companys estimate of the level of achievement of its performance targets. Each quarter, the Company compares the actual performance the Company expects to achieve with the performance targets. Legal Contingencies We are involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability of a loss and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims, and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Refer to Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material legal proceedings. New Accounting Pronouncements In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law. This act introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision), provided that certain criteria are met. In addition, on December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP FAS 109 2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. The Company repatriated approximately $584 million of cash under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 during fiscal year 2006 at a total tax cost of approximately $55 million. Refer to the Income Taxes section of this MD&A for further details. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 is 57 Table of Contents effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the Companys second quarter of fiscal year 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation, as that term is used in FASB No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The Company was required to apply the provisions of FIN 47 in fiscal year 2006. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, or SFAS No. 154, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS Statement 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principle required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income in the period of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, however, the Statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position 115 1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, or FSP 115 1, that addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. FSP 115 1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments. The guidance in FSP 115 1 amends SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. The final FSP nullifies certain requirements of EITF Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, and supersedes EITF Topic No. D 44, Recognition of Other Than Temporary Impairment upon the Planned Sale of a Security Whose Cost Exceeds Fair Value. The guidance in FSP 115 1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. The adoption of FSP 115 1 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, debt, and installment accounts receivable. We have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in liquid investments that are comprised of money market funds and debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers (Standard & Poors single A rating and higher). To mitigate risk, many of the securities have a maturity date within one year, and holdings of any one issuer, excluding the U.S. government, do not exceed 10% of the portfolio. Periodically, the portfolio is reviewed and adjusted if the credit rating of a security held has deteriorated. As of March 31, 2006, our outstanding debt approximated $1.81 billion, most of which was in fixed rate obligations. If market rates were to decline, we could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates. Each 25 basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $5 million. Each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have no material annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of March 31, 2006. As of March 31, 2006, we did not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate the above mentioned interest rate risks. 58 Table of Contents We offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our software license agreements. The aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element, which can vary with the interest rate environment. Each 25 basis point increase in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of approximately $9 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in 46 countries and, as such, a portion of our revenues, earnings, and net investments in foreign affiliates are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing expected local currency revenues in relation to local currency costs and local currency assets in relation to local currency liabilities. In October 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the Risk Management Policy and Procedures (the Policy), which authorizes us to manage, based on managements assessment, our risks/exposures to foreign currency exchange rates through the use of derivative financial instruments (e.g., forward contracts, options, swaps) or other means. We have not historically used, and do not anticipate using, derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006, we entered into derivative contracts with a total notional value of 280 million euros. Derivatives with a notional value of 80 million euros were entered into with the intent of mitigating a certain portion of our euro operating exposure and are part of the Companys on going risk management program. Derivatives with a notional value of 200 million euros were entered into during March 2006 with the intent of mitigating a certain portion of the foreign exchange variability associated with the Companys repatriation of approximately $584 million from its foreign subsidiaries. Hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133 was not applied to any of the derivatives entered into during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. The resulting gain of approximately $1 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 is included in the Other (gains) expenses, net line in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of March 31, 2006, there were no derivative contracts outstanding. In April 2006, the Company entered into similar derivative contracts as those entered during the quarter ended March 31, 2006 relating to the Companys operating exposures. Equity Price Risk As of March 31, 2006, we had $22 million in investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies. These securities were considered available for sale with any unrealized gains or temporary losses deferred as a component of stockholders equity.
