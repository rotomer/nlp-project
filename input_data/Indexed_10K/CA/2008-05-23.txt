ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Introduction This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations. This MDA should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Report. References in this MDA to fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, etc. are to our fiscal years ended on March 31, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005, etc., respectively. Business Overview We are the worlds leading independent information technology (IT) management software company, helping organizations use IT to better perform, compete, innovate and grow. We help customers govern, manage and secure their entire IT operation all of the people, information, processes, systems, networks, applications and databases from a Web service to the mainframe, regardless of the hardware or software they are using. We license our products worldwide, principally to large IT service providers, financial services companies, governmental agencies, retailers, manufacturers, educational institutions, and healthcare institutions. These customers typically maintain IT infrastructures that are both complex and central to their objectives for operational excellence. We offer our software products and solutions directly to our customers through our direct sales force and indirectly through global systems integrators, value added partners, original equipment manufacturers, and distribution partners. CAs Business Model As described in greater detail in Part I, Item 1, Business, we license our software products directly to customers as well as through distributors, resellers and value added resellers. We generate revenue from the following sources: license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis; maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements; and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation, consulting and education. The timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a reporting period are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Under our business model, we offer customers a wide range of licensing options, including the flexibility to license software under month to month licenses or to fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements. Licenses sold for most of our software products permit customers to change their software product mix as their business and technology needs change, which includes the right to receive software products in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee, commonly referred to as unspecified future software products. In such instances, we do not have vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) for the fair value of the undelivered elements, and we are therefore required under GAAP to recognize revenue from such license agreements evenly on a monthly basis (also known as ratably) over the license term. Under our business model, a relatively small percentage of our revenue is recognized on a perpetual or up front basis once all revenue recognition criteria are met in accordance with Statement of Position 97 2 Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97 2) (see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for details). In such cases, these products are not sold with the right to receive unspecified future software products and VSOE has been established for maintenance. We expect to continue to offer these types of licensing arrangements; therefore, the amount of revenue we expect to recognize on an up front basis may increase to the extent that such license agreements are not executed within a short time frame of other agreements with the same customer or in contemplation of other license agreements with the same customer for which the right exists to receive unspecified future software products. Some contracts executed prior to October 2000 (the prior business model) remain in effect and have not been renewed under license arrangements that contain the right to receive unspecific future software products. Under those agreements, and as is common practice in the software industry, we did not offer our customers the right to receive unspecified future software products and we were required under GAAP to record the present value of the license agreement as revenue at the time the license agreement was signed. As these customer license agreements are 23 Table of Contents renewed under our current licensing model, we expect to see an increase in deferred subscription value related to these licenses, from which subscription revenue will be amortized in future periods. Total deferred subscription value is also expected to increase as we transition acquired company contracts to our business model, sell additional products and capacity to existing customers, and enter into new contracts with new customers. The favorable impact on subscription revenue from the conversion of contracts from our prior business model to our business model is decreasing over time as the transition is completed. The remaining balance of unbilled installment receivables that were previously recognized as revenue under our prior business model was $0.40 billion and $0.50 billion as of March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007, respectively. Under our license agreements, customers generally make installment payments for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement. While the timing of revenue recognition is affected by the offering of unspecified future software products, it generally has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers and as a result, our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the offering of unspecified future software products. Significant Business Events Acquisitions and Divestitures In November 2006, we sold our interest in Benit for $3 million. In September 2006, we acquired Cendura Corporation a privately held provider of IT service management and application service delivery solutions. In July 2006, we acquired XOsoft, Inc. (XOsoft), a privately held company that provided continuous application availability solutions that minimize application downtime and accelerate time to recovery. In June 2006, we acquired MDY Group International, Inc., a provider of enterprise records management software and services. In May 2006, we acquired Cybermation Inc., a privately held provider of enterprise workload automation solutions. In March 2006, we acquired the common stock of Wily Technology, Inc., a provider of enterprise application management solutions. In December 2005, we acquired Control F 1 Corporation, a privately held provider of support automation solutions that automatically prevent, detect and repair end user computer problems before they disrupt critical IT services. In December 2005, we sold our wholly owned subsidiary MultiGen Paradigm, Inc. (MultiGen). MultiGen was a provider of real time, end to end 3D solutions for visualizations, simulations and training applications used for both civilian and governmental purposes. In November 2005, we announced an agreement with Garnett Helfrich Capital, a private equity firm, to create an independent corporate entity, Ingres Corporation. We divested our Ingres open source database unit into Ingres Corporation, of which Garnett Helfrich Capital is the majority shareholder and we hold a minority position. In October 2005, we acquired iLumin Software Services, Inc., a privately held provider of enterprise message management and archiving software. In July 2005, we acquired Niku Corporation (Niku), a provider of information technology management and governance solutions. In June 2005, we acquired Concord Communications, Inc. (Concord), a provider of network service management software solutions. Performance Indicators Management uses several quantitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition. Each provides a measurement of the performance of our business model and how well we are executing our plan. Our predominantly subscription based business model is unique among our competitors in the software industry and it may be difficult to compare our results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors. The 24 Table of Contents following is a summary of the principal quantitative performance indicators that management uses to review performance: YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, PERCENT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2008 2007 CHANGE CHANGE Total revenue $ 4,277 $ 3,943 $ 334 8 % Subscription and maintenance revenue $ 3,762 $ 3,458 $ 304 9 % New deferred subscription value (direct)1 $ 3,723 $ 3,107 $ 616 20 % New deferred subscription value (indirect) $ 135 $ 183 $ (48 ) (26 )% Weighted average license agreement duration in years (direct) 3.22 3.29 (0.07 ) (2 )% Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,103 $ 1,068 $ 35 3 % Income from continuing operations, net of taxes $ 500 $ 121 $ 379 313 % MARCH 31, PERCENT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2008 2007 CHANGE CHANGE Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities2 $ 2,796 $ 2,280 $ 516 23 % Total debt $ 2,582 $ 2,583 $ (1 ) % Total expected future cash collections from committed contracts3 $ 4,362 $ 4,180 $ 182 4 % Revenue to be recognized in next 12 months from committed contracts3 $ 3,478 $ 3,080 $ 398 13 % Revenue to be recognized beyond next 12 months from committed contracts3 $ 3,380 $ 3,075 $ 305 10 % Total Revenue Backlog $ 6,858 $ 6,155 $ 703 11 % 1 Includes results for our one tier channel business. 2 For March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2007, marketable securities were $1 million and $5 million, respectively. 3 Refer to the discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MDA for additional information on expected future cash collections from committed contracts, billing backlog and revenue backlog. Analyses of our performance indicators, including general trends, can be found in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MDA. The performance indicators discussed below are those that we believe are unique because of our subscription based business model. Subscription and Maintenance Revenue Subscription and maintenance revenue is the amount of revenue recognized ratably during the reporting period from either: (i) subscription license agreements that were in effect during the period, which generally include maintenance that is bundled with and not separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, or (ii) maintenance agreements associated with providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and upgrades which are separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales. New Deferred Subscription Value New deferred subscription value is the aggregate incremental amount we expect to collect from our customers over the terms of the underlying subscription license agreements entered into during a reporting period. These amounts relate to the sale of products, by distributors, resellers and value added resellers to end users, where the contracts incorporate the right for end users to receive unspecified future software products. These amounts are recognized ratably as subscription revenue over the applicable software license terms. New deferred subscription value typically excludes the value associated with certain perpetual based licenses, maintenance only license agreements, license only indirect sales, and professional services arrangements. The license agreements that contribute to new deferred subscription value represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods generally up to three years, although in certain cases customer commitments can be for longer periods. The amount of new deferred subscription value recorded in a period is affected by the volume and amount of contracts renewed during that period. Typically, our new deferred subscription value increases in each consecutive quarter during a fiscal year, with the first quarter being the weakest and the fourth quarter being the strongest. However, as we make efforts to improve the balance of the distribution of our contract renewals throughout the fiscal year, new deferred subscription value may not always follow the pattern of increasing in consecutive quarters during a fiscal year, and the quarter to quarter differences in new deferred subscription value may be more moderate. Additionally, changes in new deferred subscription value, relative to previous periods, do not necessarily correlate to changes in billings or cash receipts, relative to previous periods. The contribution to current period revenue from new deferred subscription value from any single license agreement is relatively small, since revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable license agreement term. 25 Table of Contents Weighted Average License Agreement Duration in Years The weighted average license agreement duration in years for our direct business reflects the duration of all software licenses executed during a period, weighted to reflect the contract value of each individual software license. The weighted average duration is affected by the number and dollar amounts of contracts signed during the period, and therefore may change from period to period and will not necessarily correlate to the prior year periods. If the weighted average life of our subscription license agreements remains constant, an increase in deferred subscription value will ultimately result in an increase in subscription revenue in future periods. Annualized new deferred subscription value represents the annual amount of new deferred subscription value to be recognized as subscription revenue from our direct business in future years based on the weighted average duration of the underlying contracts. It is calculated by dividing the total value of all new term based software license agreements entered into during a period in our direct business by the weighted average life of all such license agreements recorded during the same period. The annualized new deferred subscription value measures the revenue to be realized on an annual basis from the contracts signed. Total Revenue Backlog Total revenue backlog represents the aggregate amount the Company expects to recognize as revenue in the future as either subscription and maintenance revenue or professional services revenue associated with contractually committed amounts billed or to be billed as of the balance sheet date. Total revenue backlog is comprised of amounts recognized as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue billed or collected as well as unearned amounts associated with balances yet to be billed under subscription, maintenance and professional service agreements. Amounts are classified as current or non current depending on when they are expected to be earned and therefore recognized as revenue. We refer to the portion of total revenue backlog that relates to subscription and maintenance licenses as deferred subscription value. Deferred subscription value is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the underlying license agreements and is reported as Subscription and maintenance revenue line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred revenue billed or collected is comprised of: (i) amounts received in advance of revenue recognition from the customer, (ii) amounts billed but not collected for which revenue has not yet been earned, and (iii) amounts received in advance of revenue recognition from financial institutions where the Company has transferred its interest in committed installments (referred to as financing obligations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents revenue and expense line items reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 and the period over period dollar and percentage changes for those line items. Dollar amounts are expressed in millions. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. For further information, see Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Subscription and Maintenance Revenue Subscription and maintenance revenue is the amount of revenue recognized ratably during the reporting period from either: (i) subscription license agreements that were in effect during the period, which generally include maintenance that is bundled with and not separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, or (ii) maintenance agreements associated with providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and upgrades which are separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales. For fiscal 2008, subscription and maintenance revenue associated with sales made directly to our end user customers, which we define as our direct business, was $3.36 billion compared with $3.16 billion for fiscal 2007. Sales made through our channel partners, which we define as our indirect business, contributed $403 million to subscription and maintenance revenue compared with $299 million in fiscal 2007, principally due to items reclassified between direct and indirect business revenues, as well as favorable impacts from foreign exchange and growth relating to contracts executed in the prior periods. For fiscal 2008, we added new deferred subscription value related to our direct business of $3.72 billion compared with $3.11 billion for fiscal 2007. The increase in new deferred subscription value in our direct business was primarily attributable to the growth in sales of new products and services, continued improvement in the management of contract renewals, an increase in the number and dollar amounts of large contracts during the fiscal year and foreign exchange. During fiscal 2008, we renewed 61 license agreements with contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an 28 Table of Contents aggregate contract value of $1.40 billion. This is compared with fiscal 2007, when 42 license agreements were executed with contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $1.14 billion. Sales made directly to our end user customers contributed $3.16 billion to subscription and maintenance revenue in fiscal 2007 compared with $3.04 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to growth in new deferred subscription value from the sale of solutions in the areas of infrastructure management, business service optimization and security management led by the sale of acquired products partially offset by the reclassification of $46 million of subscription revenue related to value added resellers that were reclassified to the indirect business in fiscal 2007. Sales made through our channel partners contributed $299 million to subscription and maintenance revenue compared with $207 million in fiscal 2006, principally due to an increase of $49 million associated with acquisitions completed prior to March 31, 2006 and the inclusion of the aforementioned reclassification of $46 million of subscription revenue related to value added resellers. During fiscal 2007, we added new deferred subscription value related to our direct business of $3.11 billion, compared with $2.61 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase in new deferred subscription value in our direct business was primarily attributable to the growth in sales of new products and services, an improved process for the management of contract renewals, the benefits achieved from the realignment of our sales force earlier in the year, and an increase in the number, length and dollar amounts of large contracts during the fiscal year, which resulted in an increase in the weighted average contract length. During fiscal 2007, we renewed 42 license agreements with contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $1.14 billion. This is compared with fiscal 2006, when 49 license agreements were executed with contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $861 million. With respect to our indirect business, for fiscal 2007, we added new deferred subscription value of $183 million, compared with $195 million for fiscal 2006. The weighted average duration of license agreements executed in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 for our direct business was 3.22, 3.29 and 3.03 years, respectively. The annual fluctuations were attributable to the changes in the number and amounts of contracts executed with varying contract terms. During fiscal 2008, there were 48 contracts with durations of five years or longer, representing $579 million of new deferred subscription value. In comparison, during fiscal 2007 and 2006, there were 21 and 11 contracts, respectively, with durations of five years or longer, representing $531 million and $190 million of new deferred subscription value, respectively. One contract executed in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 had a contract term of seven years and represented new deferred subscription value greater than $130 million, which contributed to the higher weighted average duration of license agreements in fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2006. Annualized new deferred subscription value represents the annual amount of new deferred subscription value to be recognized as subscription revenue from our direct business in future years based on the weighted average duration of the underlying contracts. It is calculated by dividing the total value of all new term based software license agreements entered into during a period in our direct business by the weighted average life of all such license agreements recorded during the same period. The annualized new deferred subscription value for fiscal 2008 increased $213 million, or 23%, from fiscal 2007, to $1.16 billion. The annualized new deferred subscription value during fiscal 2007 increased $83 million, or 10%, from fiscal 2006 to $944 million. Professional Services The increase in professional services revenue for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was driven primarily by growth in volume of Project and Portfolio Management, Identity and Access Management and Service Management implementation projects in fiscal 2008. The increase in professional services revenue for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was primarily due to professional services engagements relating to product implementations associated with products acquired subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of $13 million, growth in security software engagements that utilize Access Control and Identity Management solutions and project and portfolio management services tied to Clarity solutions. Software Fees and Other Software fees and other revenue primarily consists of revenue that is recognized on an up front basis. This includes revenue generated through transactions with distribution and original equipment manufacturer channel partners 29 Table of Contents (sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue) and certain revenue associated with new or acquired products sold on an up front or perpetual basis. Also included is financing fee revenue, which results from the discounting of product sales recognized on a perpetual or up front basis with extended payment terms to present value. Revenue recognized on an up front or perpetual basis results in higher revenue for the period than if the same revenue had been recognized ratably under our subscription model. With respect to revenue from newly acquired products where VSOE of fair value has been established for undelivered elements, our practice has been to record revenue initially on the acquired companys systems, generally under a perpetual or up front model. Within the first fiscal year after the acquisition, new licenses for such products have historically been executed under our subscription model, which incorporates the right to receive unspecified future software products and therefore requires the associated revenue to be recognized ratably. In fiscal 2008, we decided that some new and renewal contracts for newly developed and recently acquired products will be sold, or continue to be sold, without the right to unspecified future software products. As such, software license fees from these contracts will continue to be recognized as Software fees and other. Additionally, in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we decided that license agreements for certain channel or commercial products sold through two tier distributors will no longer include the right to receive unspecified future software products. As such, license revenue from these sales where we have established VSOE for maintenance will be recognized on a perpetual or up front basis using the residual method and reflected as Software fees and other. Maintenance revenue from such sales will be deferred and recognized ratably and be reported as Subscription and maintenance revenue. For fiscal 2008, Software fees and other revenue of $132 million was a slight decrease from the $134 million recorded in fiscal 2007, as higher up front revenue was offset by lower financing fee revenue due to the decrease in the remaining number of contracts from the prior business model with extended payment terms. For fiscal 2008, we recorded revenue on an up front basis of $97 million, compared with $86 million for fiscal 2007, including revenue from our indirect business of $69 million, in fiscal 2008 compared with $46 million in fiscal 2007. The increase from the indirect business was principally due to the change noted above. For fiscal 2007, software fees and other revenue declined compared with fiscal 2006 principally due to lower revenue from products acquired in fiscal 2006 which had transitioned to our current business model, as well as the divestiture of certain business units and joint ventures such as Ingres Corporation and MultiGen. In fiscal 2007, we recorded revenue on an up front basis from our indirect business of $46 million, compared with $45 million for fiscal 2006. Total Revenue by Geography The following table presents the amount of revenue earned from sales to unaffiliated customers in the United States and international regions and corresponding percentage changes for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. FISCAL 2008 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2007 FISCAL 2007 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2006 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2008 % of Total 2007 % of Total % Change 2007 % of Total 2006 % of Total % Change United States $ 2,217 52 % $ 2,131 54 % 4 % $ 2,131 54 % $ 2,006 53 % 6 % International 2,060 48 % 1,812 46 % 14 % 1,812 46 % 1,766 47 % 3 % $ 4,277 100 % $ 3,943 100 % 9 % $ 3,943 100 % $ 3,772 100 % 5 % Note previously reported information has been reclassified to exclude discontinued operations. Fiscal 2008 revenue in the United States increased, compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to growth from higher subscription revenue resulting from subscription licenses executed in prior periods. International revenue increased compared with fiscal 2007 principally due to the favorable impacts from foreign exchange of $165 million as well as higher subscription revenue associated with an increase in deferred subscription value from contracts executed in prior periods, particularly in Europe. For fiscal 2007, revenue in the United States increased compared with fiscal 2006, primarily due to growth from products acquired during fiscal 2006 and higher subscription revenue resulting from an increase in new deferred subscription value. For fiscal 2007, international revenue decreased by $28 million, compared with fiscal 2006, which was offset by a favorable impact from foreign exchange of $74 million. 30 Table of Contents Price changes do not have a material impact on revenue in a given period as a result of our ratable subscription model. Expenses Cost of Licensing and Maintenance Costs of licensing and maintenance includes technical support costs (previously reported as part of Product development and enhancements), royalties (previously reported as part of Commissions, royalties and bonuses), and other manufacturing and distribution costs (previously included within Selling, general, and administrative). The remaining amounts previously reported under Commissions, royalties and bonuses have been allocated between Selling and marketing and General and administrative expenses. For further information, refer to Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in costs of licensing and maintenance for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to increased technical support costs for enhanced support agreements we sell to our customers. Also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2008 was the negative impact of foreign exchange. Cost of Professional Services Cost of professional services consists primarily of our personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. For fiscal 2008, the cost of professional services increased primarily due to the growth in professional services provided. Margins on professional services revenue were 9%, which represented a slight increase over fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2007, the cost of professional services increased $63 million, or 24%, compared with fiscal 2006, to $326 million. The increase was principally due to the increase in professional services revenue and was partly offset by higher usage of external consultants, which lowered margins on professional services to 7% for fiscal 2007, compared with 17% for fiscal 2006. Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and internally generated capitalized software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software development costs relate to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage. The declines in amortization of capitalized software costs from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 were both principally due to the full amortization of certain capitalized software costs related to prior acquisitions. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses include the costs relating to our sales force, costs relating to our channel partners, corporate and business marketing costs, and our customer training programs. Inclusive of a $69 million overall increase due to foreign exchange, the decline in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to reduced personnel and office costs of $37 million, mostly due to savings realized in connection with fiscal 2007 cost reduction and restructuring plan (fiscal 2007 Plan). For additional information refer to Note 3, Restructuring and Other, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Partially offsetting these declines were higher sales commissions of $23 million, primarily due to an increase in the aggregate value of contracts executed during the year. Sales commissions are expensed in the period in which they are earned by employees, which is typically upon the signing of a contract. For fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, the decline in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to lower commission costs of $86 million resulting from changes in our Incentive Compensation Plan for our sales force as well as changes in our sales organization and sales coverage model. The changes to the Incentive Compensation Plan included, among other changes, reducing accelerators in the plan (under which sales employees are paid commissions at higher rates when they reach certain levels of quota achievement), revising quotas, and reducing the number of people and functions paid on commissions as opposed to incentive compensation (bonus) plans. We believe that the changes made to the Incentive Compensation Plan for fiscal 2007, as well as certain commission related process improvements, have enhanced our ability to control overall commissions expense and avoid unexpected increases in commissions expense as occurred in the second half of fiscal 2006, as well as improve our ability to effectively estimate, calculate, monitor, and timely pay sales commissions. The lower commission expense was partially offset by higher bonus expenses resulting from acquisition related retention payments and an increase in the number of 31 Table of Contents employees who were compensated through annual incentive compensation (bonus) as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $26 million compared with fiscal 2006. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate and support functions including our executive leadership and administration groups, finance, legal, human resources, corporate communications and other costs such as provisions for doubtful accounts. Excluding a $32 million increase due to foreign exchange, general and administrative costs decreased $46 million in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 primarily due to lower personnel related expenses and consulting costs of $38 million. These decreases were primarily due to the various cost reduction efforts implemented throughout the year. In fiscal 2008, we increased our provision for doubtful accounts by $19 million, compared with fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, we recorded a $12 million reduction in general and administrative expenses due to obligations from prior period acquisitions that were settled for amounts less than originally estimated (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). For fiscal 2007, general and administrative costs increased compared with fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher personnel related expenses, a discretionary contribution to the CA Savings Harvest Plan (a 401(k) plan) that was not made in the prior year, and costs associated with acquisitions. Despite being higher, personnel related costs were favorably affected by the savings related to the restructuring actions from fiscal 2007 cost reduction and restructuring plan. In fiscal 2007, we recorded a charge of $4 million to the provision for doubtful accounts compared with a net credit of $26 million in the prior fiscal year associated with the reduction in the prior business model accounts receivable balances. These increases were partially offset by lower external consultant costs of $28 million as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $14 million compared with fiscal 2006. Product Development and Enhancements For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, product development and enhancement expenditures represented 12%, 14% and 15% of total revenue, respectively. During fiscal 2008, we continued to focus on and invest in product development and enhancements for emerging technologies and products from our recent acquisitions, as well as a broadening of our enterprise product offerings. The year over year declines in product development were principally due to a continued focus on transferring development to lower cost regions and savings realized from restructuring activities. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Intangible Assets The increase in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007, was primarily due to the amortization of intangibles recognized in conjunction with prior year acquisitions and costs capitalized in connection with our continued investment in our enterprise resource planning system. Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2007 increased from fiscal 2006 primarily due to the amortization of intangibles recognized in conjunction with fiscal 2007 and 2006 acquisitions and our enterprise resource planning system that went live in April 2006. Other Expenses (Gains), Net Gains and losses attributable to divestitures of certain assets, certain foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and certain other infrequent events have been included in the Other expenses (gains), net line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The components of Other expenses (gains), net are as follows: YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2008 2007 2006 Expenses (gains) attributable to divestitures of certain assets $ 1 $ (17 ) $ (7 ) Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (28 ) (9 ) Expenses attributable to legal settlements 33 4 1 Total $ 6 $ (13 ) $ (15 ) For fiscal 2008, we incurred expenses associated with litigation claims of $33 million. Included in the expenses for litigation claims was a charge of $14 million representing the present value of the obligation to pay additional amounts 32 Table of Contents in connection with a settlement agreement on our Senior Notes due in 2014 (Refer to the discussion of the Fiscal 2005 Senior Notes in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MDA for further information). For fiscal 2007, the gains attributable to the divestiture of certain assets were primarily related to the sale of an investment in marketable securities for a gain of $14 million. For fiscal 2006, the gain attributable to divestitures of certain assets related primarily to the non cash gain recognized on the sale of assets which were contributed during the formation of Ingres Corporation. Restructuring and Other In August 2006, we announced the fiscal 2007 plan to significantly improve our expense structure and increase our competitiveness. The objectives of the fiscal 2007 plan included a workforce reduction, global facilities consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. The total cost of the fiscal 2007 plan was initially expected to be $200 million. In April 2008, we announced additional cost reduction and restructuring actions relating to the fiscal 2007 plan. The objectives were expanded to include additional workforce reductions, global facilities consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives with expected additional costs of $75 million to $100 million, bringing the total pre tax restructuring charges for the fiscal 2007 plan to $275 million to $300 million. We currently estimate a reduction in workforce of approximately 2,800 individuals under the fiscal 2007 plan, including approximately 300 positions from the divestitures of consolidated majority owned subsidiaries considered joint ventures during fiscal 2007. Through March 31, 2008, we incurred $244 million in expenses under the fiscal 2007 plan. Refer to Note 3, Restructuring and Other in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. For fiscal 2008 and 2007, we incurred expenses of $97 million and $147 million, respectively, primarily related to severance and lease termination costs under the fiscal 2007 plan, of which $120 million remains unpaid as of March 31, 2008. The severance portion of the remaining liability balance is included in the Salaries, wages and commissions line on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The facilities abandonment portion of the remaining liability balance is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Final payment of these amounts is dependent upon settlement with the works councils in certain international locations and our ability to negotiate lease terminations. In July 2005, we announced a restructuring plan designed to more closely align our investments with strategic growth opportunities, including a workforce reduction of 5% or 800 positions worldwide. We incurred $87 million of expenses under the plan as of March 31, 2008, of which $2 million was incurred in fiscal 2008 and $11 million was unpaid as of March 31, 2008. As of March 31, 2007, we had incurred $85 million of expenses under the plan, $20 million of which was unpaid as of March 31, 2007. The severance portion of the remaining liability balance is included in the Salaries, wages and commissions line on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the respective periods. The facilities portion of the remaining liability balance is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Final payment of these amounts is dependent upon settlement with the works councils in certain international locations and our ability to negotiate lease terminations. Amounts remaining to be incurred are related to actions already undertaken and not expected to be material to future periods. During fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, we incurred $12 million and $15 million, respectively, in legal fees in connection with matters under review by the Special Litigation Committee, composed of independent members of the Board of Directors. Refer to Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, we recorded impairment charges of $6 million and $4 million, respectively, for software that was capitalized for internal use but was determined to be impaired for future periods. We also incurred an impairment charge of $12 million in fiscal 2007, relating to certain separately identifiable intangible assets acquired in conjunction with a prior year acquisition that were not subject to amortization. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we incurred an approximate $4 million expense related to a loss on the sale of an investment in marketable securities associated with the closure of an international location. During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, we incurred $4 million and $10 million, respectively, in connection with the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) entered into with the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York. 33 Table of Contents Charge for In Process Research and Development Costs For fiscal 2007, the charge for in process research and development costs of $10 million was associated with the acquisition of XOsoft. Interest Expense, Net The decrease in interest expense, net, for fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007, was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on higher average cash balances during the year. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2007 increased compared with fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in the average debt outstanding related to our borrowings under the credit facility associated with our $1 billion tender offer. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MDA and Note 7, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately 38%, 21%, and (28)% for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Refer to Note 9, Income Taxes, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On April 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48, which sets forth a comprehensive model for financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns. For further information, refer to Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of our adoption FIN 48, there was an increase to retained earnings of $11 million and a corresponding decrease to tax liabilities. Upon adoption on April 1, 2007, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $303 million and the deferred tax assets arising from such uncertain tax positions (from interest and state income tax deductions) was approximately $48 million. If the unrecognized tax benefits associated with these positions are ultimately recognized, they would primarily affect our effective tax rate. In addition, consistent with the provisions of FIN 48, we reclassified $253 million of income tax liabilities from current to non current liabilities as of April 1, 2007, because the cash payment of such liabilities was not anticipated to occur within one year of the balance sheet date. All non current income tax liabilities are recorded in the Federal, state and foreign income taxes payable noncurrent line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The income tax provision recorded for fiscal 2008 includes charges of $26 million associated with certain corporate income tax rate reductions enacted in various non US tax jurisdictions (with corresponding impacts on our net deferred tax assets). As enacted income tax rates decline, the future value of the deferred tax assets declines and therefore gives rise to a charge through the corporate income tax provision in the current period. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are adjusted to reflect the enacted rates in effect when the temporary items are expected to reverse. The income tax provision for fiscal 2007 included benefits of $23 million primarily arising from the resolution of certain international and U.S. federal tax liabilities. The income tax benefit recorded for the fiscal 2006 included benefits of $51 million arising from the recognition of certain foreign tax credits, $18 million arising from international stock based compensation deductions and $66 million arising from foreign export benefits and other international tax rate benefits. Partially offsetting these benefits was a charge of $46 million related to additional tax liabilities. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we repatriated $584 million from foreign subsidiaries in response to the favorable tax benefits afforded by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), which introduced a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, provided that certain criteria were met. During fiscal 2005, we recorded an estimate of this tax charge of $55 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a benefit of $36 million reflecting the IRS Notice 2005 38 issued on May 10, 2005. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we finalized our estimates of tax liabilities relating to the special repatriation provisions of the AJCA and determined that an adjustment was necessary and, accordingly, recorded an additional tax charge in the amount of $36 million. No provision has been made for U.S. federal income taxes on the remaining balance of the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we plan to permanently reinvest all such earnings outside the U.S. Unremitted earnings totaled $1.11 billion and $838 million as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. It is not practicable to determine the amount of the tax associated with such remitted earnings. 34 Table of Contents Selected Quarterly Information FISCAL 2008 QUARTER ENDED (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PERCENTAGE AMOUNTS) JUNE 301 SEPT. 302 DEC. 313 MAR. 314 TOTAL Revenue $ 1,025 $ 1,067 $ 1,100 $ 1,085 $ 4,277 Percentage of annual revenue 24 % 25 % 26 % 25 % 100 % Income from continuing operations $ 129 $ 137 $ 163 $ 71 $ 500 Basic income from continuing operations per share $ 0.25 $ 0.27 $ 0.32 $ 0.14 $ 0.97 Diluted income from continuing operations per share $ 0.24 $ 0.26 $ 0.31 $ 0.13 $ 0.93 FISCAL 2007 QUARTER ENDED (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PERCENTAGE AMOUNTS) JUNE 305 SEPT. 306 DEC. 317 MAR. 318 TOTAL Revenue $ 949 $ 987 $ 1,002 $ 1,005 $ 3,943 Percentage of annual revenue 24 % 25 % 25 % 26 % 100 % Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 35 $ 54 $ 52 $ (20 ) $ 121 Basic income (loss) from continuing operations per share $ 0.06 $ 0.09 $ 0.10 $ (0.04 ) $ 0.22 Diluted income (loss) from continuing operations per share $ 0.06 $ 0.09 $ 0.10 $ (0.04 ) $ 0.22 1 Includes an after tax charge of $1 million in connection with matters under review by the Special Litigation Committee (refer to Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) and an after tax charge of $4 million for severance and other expenses in connection with a restructuring plan (refer to Restructuring and Other within Results of Operations).

Also includes an after tax impairment charge of $7 million, relating to certain indefinite lived assets that were acquired in conjunction with a prior year acquisition and an after tax charge of $2 million for internal use software capitalized in connection with our enterprise resource planning system implementation that was deemed to have no future value as we have selected a different technology solution that we believe better satisfies the specific needs of the business. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash balances, including cash equivalents and marketable securities, are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with the 48% residing outside the United States. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.80 billion as of March 31, 2008, representing an increase of $520 million from the March 31, 2007 balance of $2.28 billion. As of March 31, 2008 compared with March 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents increased by $208 million due to the positive translation effect that foreign currency exchange rates had on cash held outside the United States, in currencies other than the U.S. dollars, for fiscal 2008. Sources and Uses of Cash Cash generated by continuing operating activities, which represents our primary source of liquidity, was $1.10 billion and $1.07 billion for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. For fiscal 2008, accounts receivable decreased by $111 million, compared with a decline in fiscal 2007 of $274 million. In fiscal 2008, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased $95 million compared with a decrease in the prior year of $12 million. The decline in accounts 35 Table of Contents payable for fiscal 2008 compared with the increase in fiscal 2007, was primarily a result of managements determination in fiscal 2008 that its payable cycle had exceeded an optimal level and that the accounts payable balance should be reduced from the March 31, 2007 balance. We do not expect a significant impact on future cash flows from further changes in the payable cycle. Under our subscription licenses, customers generally make installment payments over the term of the agreement, often with at least one payment due at contract execution, for the right to use our software products and receive product support, software fixes and new products when available. The timing and actual amounts of cash received from committed customer installment payments under any specific license agreement can be affected by several factors, including the time value of money and the customers credit rating. Often, the amount received is the result of direct negotiations with the customer when establishing pricing and payment terms. In certain instances, the customer negotiates a price for a single up front installment payment and seeks its own internal or external financing sources. In other instances, we may assist the customer by arranging financing on their behalf through a third party financial institution. Although the terms and conditions of the financing arrangements are negotiated by us with the financial institution, the decision whether to enter into these types of financing arrangements remains at the customers discretion. Alternatively, we may decide to transfer our rights and title to the future committed installment payments due under the license agreement to a third party financial institution in exchange for a cash payment. In these instances, the license agreements signed by the customer may contain provisions that allow for the assignment of our financial interest without customer consent. Once transferred, the future committed installments are payable by the customer to the third party financial institution. Whether the future committed installments have been financed directly by the customer with our assistance or by the transfer of our rights and title to future committed installments to a third party, such financing agreements may contain limited recourse provisions with respect to our continued performance under the license agreements. Based on our historical experience, we believe that any liability that may be incurred as a result of these limited recourse provisions will be immaterial. Amounts billed or collected as a result of a single installment for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, rather than being invoiced and collected over the life of the license agreement are reflected in the liability section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Deferred revenue (billed or collected). Amounts received from either the customer or a third party financing institution in the current period that are attributable to later years of a license agreement have a positive impact on billings and cash provided by continuing operating activities. Accordingly, to the extent such collections are attributable to the later years of a license agreement, billings and cash provided by operating activities during the licenses later years will be lower than if the payments were received over the license term. We are unable to predict with certainty the amount of cash to be collected from single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, under new or renewed license agreements to be executed in future periods. For fiscal 2008, gross receipts related to single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, increased $64 million, compared with fiscal 2007, to $641 million, principally due to activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The increase was principally due to an increase in the aggregate value of single installment contracts executed and billed within fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007, which resulted in higher collections of $147 million. This was partly offset by lower collections during fiscal 2008 from single installment contracts billed in the fiscal 2007 of $83 million. Amounts received from customers, including instances where CA assisted with arranging third party financing, increased $138 million, while amounts received from the transfer of our financial interest in committed payments to a third party financial institution decreased $74 million. For fiscal 2008, no single customer represented more than 10% of the gross receipts from single installment payments, compared with two such customers in the prior fiscal year. $21 million of installments representing the entire contract value or a substantial portion of the contract value billed in fiscal 2008 are expected to be collected in fiscal 2009, compared with $7 million that had been billed in fiscal 2007 and was collected in fiscal 2008. In any quarter, we may receive payments in advance of the contractually committed date on which the payments were otherwise due. In limited circumstances, we may offer discounts to customers to ensure payment in the current period of invoices that have been billed, but might not otherwise be paid until a subsequent period because of payment terms or other factors. Historically, any such discounts have not been material. 36 Table of Contents Our estimate of the fair value of net installment accounts receivable recorded under the prior business model approximates carrying value. Amounts due from customers under our business model are offset by deferred subscription value related to these license agreements, leaving no or minimal net carrying value on the balance sheet for such amounts. The fair value of such amounts may exceed this carrying value but cannot be practically assessed since there is no existing market for a pool of customer receivables with contractual commitments similar to those owned by us. The actual fair value may not be known until these amounts are sold, securitized or collected. Although these customer license agreements commit the customer to payment under a fixed schedule, to the extent amounts are not yet due and payable by the customer, the agreements are considered executory in nature due to our ongoing commitment to provide maintenance and unspecified future software products as part of the agreement terms. We can estimate the total amounts to be billed from committed contracts, referred to as our Billings Backlog, and the total amount to be recognized as revenue from committed contracts, referred to as our Revenue Backlog. The aggregate amount of our Billings Backlog and trade and installment receivables already reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the amounts we expect to collect in the future from committed contracts. MARCH 31, MARCH 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2008 2007 Billings Backlog: Amounts to be billed current $ 1,716 $ 1,525 Amounts to be billed non current 1,442 1,354 Total billings backlog $ 3,158 $ 2,879 Revenue Backlog: Revenue to be recognized within the next 12 months current $ 3,478 $ 3,080 Revenue to be recognized beyond the next 12 months non current 3,380 3,075 Total revenue backlog $ 6,858 $ 6,155 Deferred revenue billed or collected $ 3,700 $ 3,276 Unearned revenue yet to be billed 3,158 2,879 Total revenue backlog $ 6,858 $ 6,155 Note: Revenue Backlog includes deferred subscription, maintenance and professional services revenue We can also estimate the total cash to be collected in the future from committed contracts, referred to as our Expected future cash collections by adding the total billings backlog to the current and non current Trade and Installment Accounts Receivable from our balance sheet. MARCH 31, MARCH 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2008 2007 Expected future cash collections: Total billings backlog $ 3,158 $ 2,879 Trade and installment accounts receivable current, net 970 967 Installment accounts receivable non current, net 234 334 Total expected cash collections $ 4,362 $ 4,180 In any fiscal year, cash generated by continuing operating activities typically increases in each consecutive quarter throughout the fiscal year, with the fourth quarter being the highest and the first quarter being the lowest, which may even be negative. The timing of cash generated during the fiscal year is affected by many factors, including the timing of new or renewed contracts and the associated billings, as well as the timing of any customer financing or transfer of our interest in such contractual installments. Other factors that influence the levels of cash generated throughout the quarter can include the level and timing of expenditures. For fiscal 2007, the cash generated by continuing operating activities was highest in the third quarter, principally due to improvements in the receivable cycle attained in the third quarter which were primarily related to the transfer of our interest in committed installments to third party financial institutions, as well as the timing of tax related disbursements. 37 Table of Contents Unbilled amounts under the Companys business model are mostly collectible over one to five years. As of March 31, 2008, on a cumulative basis, 56%, 86%, 95%, 99%, and 100% of amounts due from customers recorded under the Companys business model come due within fiscal 2009 through 2013, respectively. Unbilled amounts under the prior business model are collectible over one to four years. As of March 31, 2008, on a cumulative basis, 31%, 61%, 87%, and 100% of amounts due from customers recorded under the prior business model come due within fiscal 2009 through 2012, respectively.

Fiscal 2008 Compared with Fiscal 2007 Operating Activities Cash generated by continuing operating activities for fiscal 2008 was $1.10 billion, representing a slight increase of $35 million compared with fiscal 2007. The increase was driven primarily by higher collections of $100 million, including an increase of $64 million from single installment receipts, and lower disbursements to vendors and lower payroll related disbursements of $76 million. These amounts were partly offset by higher cash payments for income taxes and interest payments. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2008 was $219 million compared with $202 million for fiscal 2007. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $27 million for fiscal 2008 compared with $212 million for fiscal 2007. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $46 million for fiscal 2008, compared with $223 million in fiscal 2007, which included proceeds on the sale leaseback of our corporate headquarters in Islandia, New York of $201 million. In fiscal 2008, the Company had net purchases of marketable securities of $3 million compared with proceeds from sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2007 of $44 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2008 was $572 million compared with $515 million in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased $500 million of our own common stock, compared with $1.21 billion in fiscal 2007. Partially offsetting the share repurchases in fiscal 2007 was an increase in borrowings of $750 million under our 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, we repaid our 2004 Revolving Credit Facility with proceeds from our new 2008 Revolving Credit Facility. During fiscal 2008, we paid dividends of $82 million, compared with $88 million in fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 Compared with Fiscal 2006 Operating Activities Cash generated by continuing operating activities for fiscal 2007 was $1.07 billion, representing a decline of $312 million compared with fiscal 2006. The decline was driven primarily by higher disbursements to vendors and higher payroll related disbursements of $167 million in the aggregate, higher cash payments for income taxes and higher disbursements relating to restructuring activities of $65 million. Additionally, collections from customers declined $39 million. The higher disbursements and lower collections were partially offset by $150 million in restitution fund payments in fiscal 2006 that did not recur in fiscal 2007. 38 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2007 was $202 million compared with $847 million for fiscal 2006. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $212 million for fiscal 2007, compared with $1.01 billion for fiscal 2006. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $223 million for fiscal 2007 which included proceeds on the sale leaseback of our corporate headquarters in Islandia, New York of $201 million. Proceeds received from the sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2007 declined $354 million to $44 million compared with fiscal 2006. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2007 was $515 million compared with $1.47 billion in fiscal 2006. The cash used in fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of the repurchase of 51 million shares for $1.21 billion, partly offset by new borrowings of $750 million under the Companys $1 billion revolving credit facility. The cash used in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of the $912 million repayment of the Companys 6.375% Senior Notes and the 3% Concord Convertible Notes, as well as share repurchases of $590 million. As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, our debt arrangements consisted of the following: 2008 2007 MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING (IN MILLIONS) AVAILABLE BALANCE AVAILABLE BALANCE Debt Arrangements: 2004 Revolving Credit Facility (terminated August 2007) $ $ $ 1,000 $ 750 2008 Revolving Credit Facility (expires August 2012) 1,000 750 6.500% Senior Notes due April 2008 350 350 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009 460 460 4.750% Senior Notes due December 2009 500 500 6.125% Senior Notes due December 2014 500 500 International line of credit 25 20 Capital lease obligations and other 22 23 Total $ 2,582 $ 2,583 As of March 31, 2008, we had $2.58 billion in debt and $2.80 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our net surplus position was $214 million. Additionally, we reported restricted cash balances of $62 million and $61 million as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which were included in the Other noncurrent assets line item. 2008 Revolving Credit Facility In August 2007, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility). The maximum committed amount available under the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility is $1 billion, exclusive of incremental credit increases of up to an additional $500 million, which are available subject to certain conditions and the agreement of our lenders. The 2008 Revolving Credit Facility replaces the prior $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility) which was due to expire on December 2, 2008. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility was terminated effective August 29, 2007, at which time outstanding borrowings of $750 million were repaid and simultaneously re borrowed under the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2008 Revolving Credit Facility expires August 29, 2012. As of March 31, 2008, $750 million was drawn down under the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate dependent on our credit ratings at the time of such borrowings and are calculated according to a base rate or a Eurocurrency rate, as the case may be, plus an applicable margin and utilization fee. The applicable margin for a base rate borrowing is 0.0% and, depending on our credit rating, the applicable margin for a Eurocurrency borrowing ranges from 0.27% to 0.875%. Also, depending on our credit rating at the time of the borrowing, the utilization fee can range from 0.10% to 0.25% for borrowings over 50% of the total commitment. At our credit ratings as of March 31, 2008, the applicable margin was 0% for a base rate borrowing and 0.60% for a Eurocurrency borrowing, and the utilization fee was 0.125%. As of March 31, 2008 the 39 Table of Contents interest rate on our outstanding borrowings was 3.83%. In addition, the Company must pay facility commitment fees quarterly at rates dependent on its credit ratings. The facility commitment fees can range from 0.08% to 0.375% of the final allocated amount of each Lenders full revolving credit commitment (without taking into account any outstanding borrowings under such commitments). Based on our credit ratings as of March 31, 2008, the facility commitment fee was 0.15% of the $1 billion committed amount. The 2008 Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants for transactions of this type, including two financial covenants: (i) for the 12 months ending each quarter end, the ratio of consolidated debt for borrowed money to consolidated cash flow, each as defined in the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility, must not exceed 4.00 to 1.00; and (ii) for the 12 months ending each quarter end, the ratio of consolidated cash flow to the sum of interest payable on, and amortization of debt discount in respect of, all consolidated debt for borrowed money, as defined in the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility, must not be less than 5.00 to 1.00. In addition, as a condition precedent to each borrowing made under the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility, as of the date of such borrowing, (i) no event of default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) we are to reaffirm that the representations and warranties we made in the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility (other than the representation with respect to material adverse changes, but including the representation regarding the absence of certain material litigation) are correct. As of March 31, 2008 we were in compliance with these debt covenants. In September 2006, we drew down $750 million under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility in order to finance a portion of our $1 billion tender offer to repurchase our common stock. Refer to Part II, Item 5, Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer for additional information. 6.500% Senior Notes In fiscal 1999, we issued $1.75 billion of unsecured Senior Notes in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 (Rule 144A). Amounts borrowed, rates, and maturities for each issue were $575 million at 6.25% due and paid in April 2003, $825 million at 6.375% due and paid in April 2005, and $350 million at 6.5% that was due and paid in April 2008. As of March 31, 2008 and 2007, $350 million of the 6.5% Senior Notes were outstanding. 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes In fiscal 2003, we issued $460 million of unsecured 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes (1.625% Notes), due December 15, 2009, in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A. The 1.625% Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with all existing senior unsecured indebtedness. Concurrent with the issuance of the 1.625% Notes, we entered into call spread repurchase option transactions (1.625% Notes Call Spread) to partially mitigate potential dilution from conversion of the 1.625% Notes. The option purchase price of the 1.625% Notes Call Spread was $73 million and the entire purchase price was charged to Stockholders Equity in December 2002. Under the terms of the 1.625% Notes Call Spread, the Company can elect to receive (i) outstanding shares equivalent to the number of shares that will be issued if all of the 1.625% Notes are converted into shares (23 million shares) upon payment of an exercise price of $20.04 per share (aggregate price of $460 million); or (ii) a net cash settlement, net share settlement or a combination, whereby the Company will receive cash or shares equal to the increase in the market value of the 23 million shares from the aggregate value at the $20.04 exercise price (aggregate price of $460 million), subject to the upper limit of $30.00 discussed below. The 1.625% Notes Call Spread is designed to partially mitigate the potential dilution from conversion of the 1.625% Notes, depending upon the market price of the Companys common stock at such time. The 1.625% Notes Call Spread can be exercised in December 2009 at an exercise price of $20.04 per share. To limit the cost of the 1.625% Notes Call Spread, an upper limit of $30.00 per share has been set, such that if the price of the common stock is above that limit at the time of exercise, the number of shares eligible to be purchased will be proportionately reduced based on the amount by which the common share price exceeds $30.00 at the time of exercise. As of March 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of the 1.625% Notes Call Spread was $88 million, which was based upon valuations from third party financial institutions. Fiscal 2005 Senior Notes In November 2004, the Company issued an aggregate of $1 billion of unsecured Senior Notes (2005 Senior Notes) in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A. The Company issued $500 million of 4.75%, 5 year notes due December 2009 and 40 Table of Contents $500 million of 5.625%, 10 year notes due December 2014. In May 2007, a lawsuit captioned The Bank of New York v. CA, Inc. et al., was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. The complaint sought unspecified damages and other relief, including acceleration of principal, based upon a claim for breach of contract. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Company failed to comply with certain purported obligations in connection with our 5.625% Senior Notes due 2014 (the Notes), issued in November 2004, insofar as the Company failed to carry out a purported obligation to cause a registration statement to become effective to permit the exchange of the Notes for substantially similar securities of the Company registered under the Securities Act of 1933 that would be freely tradable, and, having failed to effect such exchange offer, failed to carry out the purported obligation to pay additional interest of 0.50% per annum after November 18, 2006. CA denied that any such breach had occurred. On December 21, 2007, the Company, The Bank of New York, and the holders of a majority of the Notes reached a settlement of this litigation and executed a First Supplemental Indenture. The First Supplemental Indenture provides, among other things, that the Company will pay an additional 0.50% per annum interest on the $500 million principal of the Notes, with such additional interest beginning to accrue as of December 1, 2007. Pursuant to the Supplemental Indenture, the Notes are now referred to as the Companys 6.125% Senior Notes Due 2014. As a result of the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company recorded a charge of $14 million, representing the present value of the additional amounts that will be paid. This charge is included in Other expenses (gains), net line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In connection with the settlement, the Company also entered into an Addendum to Registration Rights Agreement relating to the Notes. The Addendum confirms that the Company no longer has any obligations under the original Registration Rights Agreement entered into with respect to the Notes. The settlement became effective upon the signature of the Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice by Justice Ramos of the New York Supreme Court on January 3, 2008. The Company has the option to redeem the 2005 Senior Notes at any time, at redemption prices equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes of such series being redeemed and (ii) the present value of the principal and interest payable over the life of the 2005 Senior Notes, discounted at a rate equal to 15 basis points and 20 basis points for the 5 year notes and 10 year notes, respectively, over a comparable U.S. Treasury bond yield. The maturity of the 2005 Senior Notes may be accelerated by the holders upon certain events of default, including failure to make payments when due and failure to comply with covenants in the 2005 Senior Notes. The 5 year notes were issued at a price equal to 99.861% of the principal amount and the 10 year notes at a price equal to 99.505% of the principal amount for resale under Rule 144A and Regulation S. International Line of Credit An unsecured and uncommitted multi currency line of credit is available to meet short term working capital needs for the Companys subsidiaries operating outside the United States. The line of credit is available on an offering basis, meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions, including interest rate, maturity, representations, covenants and events of default, as mutually agreed between the Companys subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction. As of March 31, 2008, the amount available under this line totaled $25 million and $4 million was pledged in support of bank guarantees and other local credit lines. Amounts drawn under these facilities as of March 31, 2008 were nominal. In addition to the above facility, the Company and its subsidiaries use guarantees and letters of credit issued by financial institutions to guarantee performance on certain contracts. As of March 31, 2008, none of these arrangements had been drawn down by third parties. Share Repurchases, Stock Option Exercises and Dividends On June 29, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to $2 billion of shares of our common stock. This plan replaced the prior $600 million common stock repurchase plan. On August 15, 2006, we announced the commencement of a $1 billion tender offer to repurchase outstanding common stock, at a price not less than $22.50 and not greater than $24.50 per share. On September 14, 2006, the expiration date of the tender offer, we accepted for purchase 41.2 million shares at a purchase price of $24.00 per share, for a total price of $989 million, which excludes bank, legal and other associated charges. Upon completion of the tender offer, we retired all of the shares that were repurchased. 41 Table of Contents In November 2007, we concluded our previously announced $500 million Accelerated Share Repurchase program with a third party financial institution. In June 2007, we paid $500 million to repurchase shares of our common stock and received 16.9 million shares at inception of the program. Based on the terms of the agreement between us and the third party financial institution, we received 3.0 million additional shares of our common stock at the conclusion of the program in November 2007 at no additional cost. The average price paid under the Accelerated Share Repurchase program was $25.13 per share and total shares repurchased was 19.9 million. Our remaining authority under the previously authorized plan to repurchase up to $2 billion in shares of common stock has expired. Any potential future repurchases will be considered by us in the normal course of business. We repurchased $1.21 billion of common stock in connection with our publicly announced corporate buyback program in fiscal 2007 compared with $590 million in fiscal 2006; for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, we received proceeds resulting from the exercise of Company stock options of $19 million, $39 million and $97 million, respectively. Beginning in fiscal 2006 we increased our annual cash dividend to $0.16 per share, which was paid out in quarterly installments of $0.04 per share as and when declared by the Board of Directors. We paid dividends of $82 million, $88 million and $93 million in each of fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Effect of Exchange Rate Changes There was a $208 million favorable impact to our cash flows in fiscal 2008 predominantly due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar of 18%, 13% and 12%, respectively. In fiscal 2007, we had a favorable $93 million impact to our cash flows, predominantly due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and the euro, by 7% each. Other Matters As of March 31, 2008, our senior unsecured notes were rated Ba1, BB, and BB+ by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), Standard and Poors (SP) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch), respectively. The outlook on these unsecured notes is rated negative, positive and stable by Moodys, SP and Fitch, respectively. In December 2007 Fitch revised its rating outlook from negative to the current stable outlook and in March 2008 SP placed the company on credit watch with positive implications. As of May 2008, our rating and outlook remained unchanged. Peak borrowings under all debt facilities during fiscal 2008 totaled $2.58 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.12%. Capital resource requirements as of March 31, 2008 and 2007 consisted of lease obligations for office space, equipment, mortgage and loan obligations, our enterprise resource planning implementation, and amounts due as a result of product and company acquisitions. Refer to Contractual Obligations and Commitments for additional information. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines and in the capital markets, and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. We expect our long standing practice of providing extended payment terms to our customers to continue. We expect to use existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund financing activities such as the repayment of our debt balances as they mature as well as the repurchase of shares of common stock and the payment of dividends as approved by our Board of Directors. Cash generated will also be used for investing activities such as future acquisitions as well as additional capital spending, including our continued investment in our enterprise resource planning implementation. The Company conducts an ongoing review of its capital structure and debt obligations as part of its risk management strategy. Excluding the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, the fair value of the Companys long term debt, including the current portion of long term debt, was $1.89 billion and $1.92 billion as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The fair value of long term debt is based on quoted market prices. Refer to the Fair Value of Financial Instruments section of Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 42 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Prior to fiscal 2001, we sold individual accounts receivable to a third party subject to certain recourse provisions. The outstanding principal balance subject to recourse of these receivables approximated $81 million and $115 million as of March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of March 31, 2008, we have not incurred any losses related to these receivables. Other than the commitments and recourse provisions described above, we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and, accordingly, off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with current accounting rules, the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of March 31, 2008 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. In addition, the table summarizes the timing of payments on our debt obligations as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2008. PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN 13 35 MORE THAN (IN MILLIONS) TOTAL 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS 5 YEARS Contractual Obligations Long term debt obligations (inclusive of interest) $ 2,992 $ 451 $ 1,114 $ 866 $ 561 Operating lease obligations1 787 147 215 137 288 Purchase obligations 93 61 31 1 Other obligations2 223 107 65 33 18 Total $ 4,095 $ 766 $ 1,425 $ 1,037 $ 867 1 The contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases include sublease income totaling $67 million expected to be received in the following periods: $24 million (less than 1 year); $28 million (13 years); $14 million (35 years); and $1 million (more than 5 years). 2 Includes $55 million of estimated liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. As of March 31, 2008, we have no material capital lease obligations, either individually or in the aggregate. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that impact our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. We consider the following significant accounting polices to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources: (1) licensing software products; (2) providing customer technical support (referred to as maintenance); and (3) providing professional services, such as consulting and education. Revenue is recorded net of applicable sales taxes. 43 Table of Contents We recognize revenue pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2 Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as amended by SOP 98 9 Modification of SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. In accordance with SOP 97 2, we begin to recognize revenue from licensing and supporting our software products when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer; (2) we deliver the products; (3) license agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final; and (4) collection is probable. Under our subscription model, implemented in October 2000, software license agreements typically combine the right to use specified software products, the right to maintenance, and the right to receive and use unspecified future software products for no additional fee during the term of the agreement. Under these subscription licenses, once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria are met, we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement. For license agreements signed prior to October 2000, once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met, software license fees were recognized as revenue generally when the software was delivered to the customer, or up front (as the contracts did not include a right to unspecified future software products), and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license. Under our current business model, a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an up front or perpetual basis, subject to meeting the same revenue recognition criteria in accordance with SOP 97 2 as described above. Software fees from such licenses are recognized up front and are reported in the Software fees and other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Maintenance fees from such licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the license and are reported in the Subscription and maintenance revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. License agreements under which software fees are recognized up front do not include the right to receive unspecified future software products. However, in the event such license agreements are executed within close proximity or in contemplation of other license agreements that are signed under our subscription model with the same customer, the licenses together may be deemed a single multi element agreement, and all such revenue is required to be recognized ratably and is recorded as Subscription and maintenance revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in license agreements that include software products for which maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices and arrangements that contain rights to unspecified future software products. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when VSOE of fair value can be established. When the license includes the right to receive unspecified future software products, license revenue is recognized ratably over the term on the arrangement as VSOE does not exist for the unspecified future software products. Since we implemented our subscription model in October 2000, our practice with respect to newly acquired products with established VSOE of fair value has been to record revenue initially on the acquired companys systems, generally under a perpetual or up front model; and, starting within the first fiscal year after the acquisition, to enter new licenses for such products under our subscription model, following which revenue is recognized ratably and recorded as Subscription and maintenance revenue. In some instances, we sell some newly developed and recently acquired products without the right to receive unspecified future software products. Revenue from these agreements is generally recorded on an up front model, to the extent that we are able to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements and such license agreements are not deemed to have been linked with other contracts executed within a short time frame with the same customer or in contemplation of other license agreements with the same customer for which the right exists to receive unspecified future software products. The software license fees from these contracts are recorded on an up front basis as Software fees and other. Selling such licenses under an up front model will result in higher total revenue in a reporting period than if such licenses were based on our subscription model and the associated revenue recognized ratably. Maintenance revenue is derived from two primary sources: (1) the maintenance portion of combined license and maintenance agreements; and (2) stand alone maintenance agreements. Maintenance revenue is reported on the Subscription and maintenance revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the term of the renewal agreement. 44 Table of Contents Revenue from professional service arrangements is generally recognized as the services are performed. Revenue from committed professional services that are sold as part of a software transaction is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the life of the related software transaction. If it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed. Revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and value added resellers commences when all four of the SOP 97 2 revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software product to their customers. This is commonly referred to as the sell through method. Revenue from the sale of products to distributors, resellers and value added resellers that incorporates the right for the end users to receive certain unspecified future software products is recognized on a ratable basis. We have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and have a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under such agreements. We assess collectability based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed through the receipt of cash payment. Our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products. Such warranties are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. The likelihood that we will be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. Under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements, we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on, among other things, allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. In most cases, in the event of an infringement claim, we retain the right to (i) procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product; (ii) replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be reasonably achieved, we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid. Such indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5. The likelihood that we will be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. In most cases and where legally enforceable, the indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer. Accounts Receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for the potential impairment of accounts receivable on the balance sheet. In developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts, we rely on several factors, including: Historical information, such as general collection history of multi year software agreements; Current customer information and events, such as extended delinquency, requests for restructuring, and filings for bankruptcy; Results of analyzing historical and current data; and The overall macroeconomic environment. The allowance is composed of two components: (a) specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when, based on current information, we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer; and (b) an allowance for losses inherent in the remaining receivable portfolio based historical activity. Income Taxes When we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate. On April 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). Among other things, FIN 48 prescribes a more likely than not threshold for the recognition and derecognition of tax positions, provides guidance on the accounting for interest and penalties relating to tax positions and requires that the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position. 45 Table of Contents SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability in each jurisdiction; estimate differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement purposes versus tax return purposes (known as temporary differences), which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities; and assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets and net operating losses will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We have recognized as a deferred tax asset a portion of the tax benefits connected with losses related to operations. As of March 31, 2008, our gross deferred tax assets, net of a valuation allowance, totaled $828 million. Realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized. The factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets result from acquisition expenses, such as duplicate facility costs, employee severance and other costs that are not deductible until paid, net operating losses (NOLs) and temporary differences between the taxable cash payments received from customers and the ratable recognition of revenue in accordance with GAAP. The NOLs expire between fiscal 2009 and 2028. Additionally, $61 million of the valuation allowance as of March 31, 2008 and as of March 31, 2007 is attributable to acquired NOLs that are subject to annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Future results may vary from these estimates. Goodwill, Capitalized Software Products, and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142), requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life. Absent any prior indicators of impairment, we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model is a two step process. The first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination; that is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test is measured using the quoted market price method. Determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. These estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management. This approach uses significant assumptions, including projected future cash flow, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flow, and a terminal growth rate. There was no impairment charge recorded with respect to goodwill for fiscal 2008. The carrying values of capitalized software products, for both purchased software and internally developed software, and other intangible assets, are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that any excess of the carrying value over the net realizable value is written off. The facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of cost for other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date. It is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or, if such an impairment were to occur, the magnitude thereof. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are subject to amortization over the expected period of economic benefit to the Company. We evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. In cases where a revision to the 46 Table of Contents remaining period of amortization is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we determined that an impairment charge of $0.5 million relating to certain identifiable intangible assets that were acquired in conjunction with a prior year acquisition and were not subject to amortization should be recorded. For fiscal 2008, the impairment charge was reported in the Restructuring and other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The balance of assets with indefinite lives as of both March 31, 2008 and 2007 was $14 million. Accounting for Business Combinations The allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Product Development and Enhancements We account for product development and enhancements in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed (SFAS No. 86). SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates. If other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility, the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been affected. Annual amortization of capitalized software costs is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product, generally estimated to be five years from the date the product became available for general release to customers. The Company amortized capitalized software costs using the straight line method in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, as anticipated future revenue is projected to increase for several years considering the Company is continuously integrating current software technology into new software products. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation We currently maintain several stock based compensation plans. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain stock based awards. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk free interest rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock based compensation expense could have been materially affected. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially affected in future years. As described in Note 10, Stock Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, performance share units (PSUs) are awards under the long term incentive programs for senior executives where the number of shares or restricted shares, as applicable, ultimately received by the employee depends on Company performance measured against specified targets and will be determined after a three year or one year period as applicable. The fair value of each award is estimated on the date that the performance targets are established based on the fair value of our stock and our estimate of the level of achievement of our performance targets. We are required to recalculate the fair value of issued PSUs each reporting period until the underlying shares are granted. The adjustment is based on the quoted market price of our stock on the reporting period date. Each quarter, we compare the actual performance we expect to achieve with the performance targets. Legal Contingencies We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment 47 Table of Contents is required in both the determination of the probability of a loss and the determination as to whether the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, the decision to record an accrual and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims, and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Refer to Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material legal proceedings. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 157 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 159 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non controlling interest in the acquiree. The Statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 13, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 5, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. APB 14 1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement). FSP No. APB 14 1 requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to account separately for the liability and equity components of the instrument. The debt would be recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The equity component would be recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the note and the fair value of the liability. FSP No. APB 14 1 will also require an accretion of the resultant debt discount over the expected life of the debt. The proposed transition guidance requires retrospective application to all periods presented, and does not grandfather existing instruments. FSP No. APB 14 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of FSP No. APB 14 1 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, debt, and installment accounts receivable. We have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in liquid investments that are composed of money market funds and debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers 48 Table of Contents (SP single A rating and higher). To mitigate risk, all of the securities have a maturity date within one year, and holdings of any one issuer do not exceed 10% of the portfolio. As of March 31, 2008, our outstanding debt approximated $2.58 billion, most of which was in fixed rate obligations. If market rates were to decline, we could be required to make payments on the fixed rate debt that would exceed those based on current market rates. Each 25 basis point decrease in interest rates would have an associated annual opportunity cost of $5 million. Each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have a corresponding effect on our variable rate debt of $2 million as of March 31, 2008. As of March 31, 2008, we did not utilize derivative financial instruments to mitigate the above mentioned interest rate risks. We offer financing arrangements with installment payment terms in connection with our software license agreements. The aggregate amounts due from customers include an imputed interest element, which can vary with the interest rate environment. Each 25 basis point increase in interest rates would currently have an associated annual opportunity cost of $9 million. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in 46 countries and, as such, a portion of our revenues, earnings, and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing expected local currency revenues in relation to local currency costs and local currency assets in relation to local currency liabilities. In October 2005, the Board of Directors adopted our Risk Management Policy and Procedures, which authorizes us to manage, based on managements assessment, our risks and exposures to foreign currency exchange rates through the use of derivative financial instruments (e.g., forward contracts, options, swaps) or other means. We have not historically used, and do not anticipate using, derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). As of March 31, 2008, we had no outstanding derivative contracts in place. We recognized a loss of $6 million, associated with derivative contracts that were closed, as of March 31, 2008 and settled in April 2008. For all derivative contracts that were entered into during fiscal 2008, the Company recognized a loss of $14 million. These contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS No. 133. These results are included in the Other expenses (gains), net line item of the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2008. In April and May 2008, we entered into a series of derivative contracts to protect the Company against the risks associated with movements in foreign exchange rates on the balance sheet and expected operating exposures throughout fiscal 2009. We anticipate that we will continue to employ derivatives to protect the Company against these risks as the size of the balance sheet and expected operating exposures change throughout the fiscal year. Equity Price Risk As of March 31, 2008, we did not hold significant investments in marketable equity securities of publicly traded companies. Our investments in marketable securities were considered available for sale. Unrealized gains or temporary losses on available for sale securities are deferred as a component of stockholders equity.
