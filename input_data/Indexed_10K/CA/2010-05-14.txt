ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Introduction This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, change in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations. This MDA should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Report and the Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Report as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Report. References in this MDA to fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 are to our fiscal years ended on March 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Business Overview We are the leading independent enterprise IT management software and service company with deep expertise across IT environments from mainframe and physical to virtual and cloud. We develop and deliver software and services that help organizations manage and secure their IT infrastructures and deliver more flexible IT services. This allows companies to more effectively and efficiently respond to business needs. We address virtually all of the components of the computing environment, including people, information, processes, systems, networks, applications and databases, regardless of the hardware or software customers are using. We have a broad portfolio of software products that address our customers needs with a specific focus on service management and assurance; mainframe; project and portfolio management; security (identity and access management); virtualization and automation; and cloud computing. We deliver our products on premise or, for certain products, via Software as a Service (SaaS). We license our products worldwide. We service companies across most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers, governmental agencies, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational institutions and health care institutions. These customers typically maintain IT infrastructures that are both complex and central to their objectives for operational excellence. We offer our software products and solutions directly to our customers through our direct sales force and indirectly through global systems integrators, managed service providers, technology partners, value added resellers, exclusive representatives and distributors and volume partners. CAs Business Model We generate revenue from the following sources: license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis; maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements; and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation, consulting and education. The timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a reporting period are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Revenue is reported net of applicable sales taxes. Under our business model, we offer customers a wide range of licensing options, including the flexibility to license software under month to month licenses or to fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements. Licenses sold for most of our software products permit customers to change their software product mix as their business and technology needs change and include the right to receive software products in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee, commonly referred to as unspecified future software products, as well as maintenance included during the term of each license. In some instances, we sell certain products without the right to receive unspecified future software products. Performance Indicators Management uses several quantitative and qualitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition. Each provides a measurement of the performance of our business and how well we are executing our plan. 21 Table of Contents Our predominantly subscription based business model is less common among our competitors in the software industry and it may be difficult to compare the results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors. The following is a summary of the principal performance indicators that management uses to review performance: YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, PERCENT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2010 2009 CHANGE CHANGE Total revenue $ 4,353 $ 4,271 $ 82 2 % Subscription and maintenance revenue $ 3,887 $ 3,772 $ 115 3 % Net income $ 771 $ 671 $ 100 15 % Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,360 $ 1,212 $ 148 12 % Total bookings $ 4,964 $ 5,245 $ (281 ) (5 )% Subscription and maintenance bookings $ 4,435 $ 4,783 $ (348 ) (7 )% Weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years 3.54 3.61 (0.07 ) (2 )% Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings $ 1,253 $ 1,325 $ (72 ) (5 )% AS OF AS OF MARCH 31, MARCH 31, PERCENT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2010 2009 CHANGE CHANGE Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,583 $ 2,712 $ (129 ) (5 )% Total debt $ 1,545 $ 1,908 $ (363 ) (19 )% Total expected future cash collections from committed contracts(1) $ 5,564 $ 4,914 $ 650 13 % Total revenue backlog(1) $ 8,210 $ 7,378 $ 832 11 % (1) Refer to the discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MDA for additional information on expected future cash collections from committed contracts, billing backlog and revenue backlog. Analyses of our performance indicators, including general trends, can be found in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MDA. Total Revenue Total revenue is the amount of revenue recognized during the reporting period from subscription and maintenance agreements, professional services arrangements and software fees and other revenue recognized during the reporting period. Subscription and Maintenance Revenue Subscription and maintenance revenue is the amount of revenue recognized ratably during the reporting period from: (i) subscription license agreements that were in effect during the period, generally including maintenance that is bundled with and not separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, (ii) maintenance agreements associated with providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and upgrades that are separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, and (iii) license agreements bundled with additional products, maintenance or professional services for which Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (VSOE) has not been established. These amounts include the sale of products directly by us, as well as by distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives to end users, where the contracts incorporate the right for end users to receive unspecified future software products, and other contracts entered into in close proximity or contemplation of such agreements. Total Bookings Total bookings includes the incremental value of all subscription, maintenance and professional service contracts and software fees and other contracts entered into during the reporting period. Subscription and Maintenance Bookings Subscription and maintenance bookings is the aggregate incremental amount we expect to collect from our customers over the terms of the underlying subscription and maintenance agreements entered into during a reporting period. These amounts include the sale of products directly by us and may include additional products, services or other fees for which we have not established VSOE. Subscription and maintenance bookings also includes indirect sales by distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives to end users, where the contracts incorporate the right for end users to receive unspecified future software products, and other contracts without these rights entered into in close proximity or contemplation of such agreements. These amounts are expected to be recognized ratably as subscription and maintenance revenue over the applicable term of the agreements. Subscription and maintenance bookings excludes the value associated with certain perpetual licenses, license only indirect sales, and professional services arrangements. 22 Table of Contents The license and maintenance agreements that contribute to subscription and maintenance bookings represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods that range generally from three to five years on a weighted average basis, although individual customer commitments can be for longer or shorter periods. These current period bookings are often renewals of prior contracts that also had various durations, usually from three to five years. The amount of new subscription and maintenance bookings recorded in a period is affected by the volume, duration and value of contracts renewed during that period. Our subscription and maintenance bookings typically increase in each consecutive quarter during a fiscal year, with the first quarter having the least amount of bookings and the fourth quarter having the highest bookings. However, subscription and maintenance bookings may not always follow the pattern of increasing in consecutive quarters during a fiscal year, and the quarter to quarter differences in subscription and maintenance bookings may vary. Given the varying durations of the contracts being renewed, year over year comparisons on bookings are not always indicative of the overall bookings trend. We believe our revenue backlog is our best indicator of future revenue due to the high percentage of our revenue that is recognized from license agreements that are already committed and being recognized ratably. Additionally, period to period changes in subscription and maintenance bookings do not necessarily correlate to changes in cash receipts. The contribution to current period revenue from subscription and maintenance bookings from any single license or maintenance agreement is relatively small, since revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable term for these agreements. Weighted Average Subscription and Maintenance License Agreement Duration in Years The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years reflects the duration of all subscription and maintenance agreements executed during a period, weighted by the total contract value of each individual agreement. Annualized Subscription and Maintenance Bookings Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings is an indicator that normalizes the bookings recorded in the current period to account for contract length. It is calculated by dividing the total value of all new subscription and maintenance license agreements entered into during a period by the weighted average subscription and license agreement duration in years for all such subscription and maintenance license agreements recorded during the same period. Total Revenue Backlog Total revenue backlog represents the aggregate amount we expect to recognize as revenue in the future as either subscription and maintenance revenue, professional services revenue or software fees and other revenue associated with contractually committed amounts billed or to be billed as of the balance sheet date. Total revenue backlog is composed of amounts recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred revenue (billed or collected) as well as unearned amounts yet to be billed under subscription and maintenance and software fees and other agreements. Amounts are classified as current or non current depending on when they are expected to be earned and therefore recognized as revenue. The portion of the total revenue backlog that relates to subscription and maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the underlying agreements and is reported as subscription and maintenance revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred revenue (billed or collected) is composed of: (i) amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition, (ii) amounts billed but not collected for which revenue has not yet been earned, and (iii) amounts received in advance of revenue recognition from financial institutions where we have transferred our interest in committed installments. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents revenue and expense line items reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 and the period over period dollar and percentage changes for those line items.

Revenue The $82 million increase in total revenue for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a higher annualized value of customer contracts contributing to revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of $32 million and a decrease in professional services revenue. Total revenue for fiscal 2009 decreased $6 million compared with fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 revenue was unfavorably affected by foreign exchange of $35 million compared with fiscal 2008, partially offset by a higher value of customer subscription and maintenance contracts. Subscription and Maintenance Revenue The increase in subscription and maintenance revenue for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a higher annualized value of customer contracts contributing to revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009, partially offset by a $32 million negative effect from foreign exchange. Subscription and maintenance revenue increased slightly for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in the value of existing customer contracts, partially offset by a $32 million negative effect from foreign exchange. Subscription and Maintenance Bookings For fiscal 2010 and 2009, our subscription and maintenance bookings were $4,435 million and $4,783 million, respectively. The decrease in subscription and maintenance bookings for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to several large contract extensions with terms of approximately five years entered into during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, two of which had a combined contract value of approximately $550 million. During fiscal 2010, we renewed a total of 68 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of 25 Table of Contents $2,146 million. During fiscal 2009, we renewed a total of 68 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $2,471 million. The decrease in the dollar value of the agreements in excess of $10 million was primarily attributable to the large contract renewals that were signed in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, annualized subscription and maintenance bookings decreased $72 million from the prior year period to $1,253 million. The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years decreased slightly from fiscal 2009 to 2010, from 3.61 to 3.54. Although each contract is subject to terms negotiated by the respective parties, management does not currently expect the weighted average duration of contracts to change materially from current levels for end user contracts. For fiscal 2009 and 2008, our subscription and maintenance bookings were $4,783 million and $4,110 million, respectively. Subscription and maintenance bookings for fiscal 2009 were favorably affected by an increase in U.S. renewal bookings compared with the prior year period primarily due to the size and duration of the contracts that were renewed in fiscal 2009, partially offset by an unfavorable variance due to foreign exchange. During fiscal 2009, we renewed a total of 68 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $2,471 million. During fiscal 2008, we renewed a total of 61 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $1,396 million. The increase in the dollar value of the agreements in excess of $10 million was primarily attributable to the execution of several large contract extensions with terms of approximately five years in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, two of which had a combined contract value of approximately $550 million. For fiscal 2009, annualized subscription and maintenance bookings decreased $54 million from the prior year period to $1,325 million. The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years increased to 3.61 for fiscal 2009 compared with 2.98 for fiscal 2008 due to an increase in the number and dollar values of contracts executed with contract terms longer than historical averages. Professional Services Professional services revenue primarily includes product implementation, customer training and customer education. The revenue decrease for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily a result of our customers reduced discretionary spending due to the difficult economic environment. The revenue decrease for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to our concerted efforts to reduce the number of low margin service contracts in all regions, revenue decreases from customer delays in signing professional service contracts due to the difficult economic environment and revenue decreases in the Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) region, which was due to our decision to stop providing professional services in certain markets in conjunction with our change in that region from a direct to an indirect sales model. Software Fees and Other Software fees and other revenue primarily consists of revenue that is recognized on an up front basis. This includes revenue generated through transactions with distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives (sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue) and certain revenue associated with products sold on an up front basis. In fiscal 2009 we recorded $5 million under the license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement entered into with Rocket Software, Inc. (Rocket) that expires in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2010 we recorded $6 million from a renegotiated payment schedule under this agreement. Software fees and other revenue increased for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $39 million increase in revenue associated with acquired new products and existing application management products sold on an up front basis. Approximately $18 million of these revenues were from products of NetQoS, which was acquired during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2009, software fees and other revenue increased from fiscal 2008 primarily due to an $11 million increase in our indirect business revenue and $5 million from the aforementioned settlement agreement we entered into with Rocket partially offset by lower financing fees and other revenue. 26 Table of Contents Total Revenue by Geography The following table presents the amount of revenue earned from sales to unaffiliated customers in the United States and international regions and corresponding percentage changes for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. FISCAL 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2009 FISCAL 2009 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2008 (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2010 % of Total 2009 % of Total % Change 2009 % of Total 2008 % of Total % Change United States $ 2,414 55 % $ 2,291 54 % 5 % $ 2,291 54 % $ 2,217 52 % 3 % International 1,939 45 % 1,980 46 % (2 )% 1,980 46 % 2,060 48 % (4 )% $ 4,353 100 % $ 4,271 100 % 2 % $ 4,271 100 % $ 4,277 100 % 0 % Revenue in the U.S. increased by 5% for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to a higher annual value of customer subscription and maintenance contracts. For fiscal 2010, international revenue decreased by approximately 2% as compared with the prior period primarily due to the unfavorable effect from foreign exchange of $32 million. U.S. revenue increased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to growth from higher subscription revenue resulting from subscription agreements executed in prior periods. International revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 partially due to the unfavorable effect from foreign exchange of $35 million as well as a $37 million revenue decrease in the APJ region, which was mostly due to our decision to stop providing professional services in certain markets in conjunction with our change in that region from a direct to indirect sales model. Price changes do not have a material effect on revenue in a given period as a result of our ratable subscription model. Expenses The overall decrease in operating expenses for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to lower restructuring costs partially offset by increased selling and marketing, general and administrative and other costs. The overall decrease in operating expenses for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to improved cost management and increased operating efficiencies, including personnel and other savings realized from the fiscal 2007 cost reduction and restructuring plan (fiscal 2007 restructuring plan). In addition, there was a favorable effect from foreign exchange of $35 million for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008. Costs of Licensing and Maintenance Costs of licensing and maintenance include technical support, royalties, and other manufacturing and distribution costs. Costs of licensing and maintenance for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 decreased $8 million due to lower royalty fees offset by increases in product support expenses and other costs. The increase in costs of licensing and maintenance for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the strategic partnership agreement that we signed with an outside third party relating to our Internet Security business during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, under which fees are paid based on sales volumes. Prior to this strategic partnership, the development costs relating to this business were included in product development and enhancements. These increases in costs of licensing and maintenance were partially offset by decreases in product support expenses. Cost of Professional Services Cost of professional services consists primarily of our personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. For fiscal 2010, cost of professional services decreased as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $36 million decrease in consulting and personnel costs, mostly related to lower sales volumes, and a $4 million favorable foreign exchange variance. Professional services gross margin for fiscal 2010 was 11% as compared with 14% for fiscal 2009 mostly due to lower utilization rates resulting from the decrease in sales. The decrease in cost of professional services for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a reduced use of external consultants, reduced personnel costs and our effort to reduce the number of low margin service contracts which resulted in cost reductions due to lower sales volume and margin improvements. As a result of the decreased cost of professional services, the margins on professional services revenue improved to 14% for fiscal 2009 compared with 4% for fiscal 2008. 27 Table of Contents Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and internally generated capitalized software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software development costs relate to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage. The increases in amortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 and in fiscal 2009 as compared with fiscal 2008 were principally due to the capitalizable value of projects that have reached technological feasibility in recent periods. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses include costs relating to our sales force, channel partners, corporate and business marketing and customer training programs. The increase in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increased personnel costs of $20 million partially from acquired companies and higher commission costs of $30 million resulting from new product sales partially offset by reduced promotion expenses of $21 million, principally attributable to the timing of CA World in fiscal 2009. CA World is our largest periodic promotional and marketing event that takes place approximately every 18 months, which did not occur during fiscal 2010. Including a $15 million decrease due to foreign exchange, the decline in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to decreases in personnel costs of $48 million, promotion expenses of $26 million, office and IT costs of $14 million and external consulting costs of $11 million in connection with our cost reduction efforts. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate and support functions, including our executive leadership and administration groups, finance, legal, human resources and corporate communications and other costs, such as provisions for doubtful accounts. For fiscal 2010, general and administrative costs increased $15 million as compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to $17 million in costs related to the departure of our Chief Executive Officer and the transition to his successor. We also incurred a $12 million increase in costs attributable to acquisitions and other strategic initiatives partially offset by a $7 million reduction in bad debt expenses and other cost reductions. Including a $4 million decrease due to foreign exchange, general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower office and IT costs of $28 million, lower personnel related expenses of $16 million, lower external consulting costs of $18 million and a reduction in bad debt expenses of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by a $12 million reduction in general and administrative expenses we recorded in fiscal 2008 due to obligations from prior period acquisitions that were settled for amounts less than originally estimated (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Product Development and Enhancements Product development and enhancements expenses for fiscal 2010 decreased from fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase in resources dedicated to internally developed software for strategic investments in our security, mainframe and infrastructure management products, which are capitalized and reflected in the Capitalized development costs and other intangible assets, net line on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Mostly offsetting this decrease in expenses were increased personnel costs, an increase in our investment in product development and enhancements for emerging technologies, and a broadening of our enterprise product offerings to build on our portfolio of software and services to meet next generation market opportunities. Expenses declined during fiscal 2009 as compared with fiscal 2008 primarily due to the strategic partnership agreement relating to the development of products associated with our Internet Security business and increased capitalization of internally developed software, partially offset by higher personnel costs. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, product development and enhancements expenses represented approximately 11%, 11% and 12% of total revenue, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Intangible Assets The increase in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the increased value of fixed assets placed into service during fiscal 2010. 28 Table of Contents The decrease in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to decreased amortization costs of intangible assets relating to prior period acquisitions. Other Expenses (Gains), net Other expenses (gains), net includes gains and losses attributable to divested assets, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and certain other items. YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2010 2009 2008 (Gains) expenses attributable to divestitures of certain assets and other items $ (1 ) $ (5 ) $ 1 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 10 (11 ) (28 ) Expenses attributable to litigation claims and settlements 5 15 33 Total $ 14 $ (1 ) $ 6 In fiscal 2010, we recorded net foreign exchange losses of $10 million. The foreign exchange amounts recorded in fiscal 2010 included net losses of $20 million associated with derivative contracts, which we use to mitigate our operating risks and exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. These losses were offset by foreign currency transaction gains due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of other countries in which we conduct our operations. In fiscal 2009, we recorded net foreign exchange gains of $11 million. The foreign exchange amounts recorded in fiscal 2009 included net gains of $77 million associated with derivative foreign exchange contracts, which we use to mitigate our operating risks and exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. These gains were mostly offset by foreign exchange losses from other operating activities due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of other countries in which we conduct our operations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we recognized a gain of $5 million associated with our repurchase of $148 million principal amount of our 4.750% Senior Notes. Restructuring and Other The Fiscal 2010 Restructuring Plan (Fiscal 2010 Plan) was approved in March 2010. The Fiscal 2007 Restructuring Plan (Fiscal 2007 Plan) was approved in August 2006. For fiscal 2010 and 2009, we incurred expenses of $46 million and $96 million, respectively, primarily related to severance and lease abandonment and termination costs under the Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2007 Plans, of which $116 million remained unpaid as of March 31, 2010. The severance portion of the remaining liability balance is included in the Accrued salaries, wages and commissions line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The facilities abandonment portion of the remaining liability balance is included in the Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Final payment of these amounts is dependent upon settlement with the works councils in certain international locations and our ability to negotiate lease terminations. (Refer to Note 3, Restructuring and Other, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). During fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $3 million and $5 million, respectively, for software that was capitalized for internal use but was determined to be impaired. During fiscal 2010, we incurred $3 million in legal fees in connection with matters under review by the Special Litigation Committee (refer to Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we incurred a $4 million expense related to a loss on the sale of an investment in marketable securities associated with the closure of an international location. During fiscal 2008, we incurred $12 million in legal fees in connection with matters under review by the Special Litigation Committee. Interest Expense, net The increase in interest expense, net for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a decline in short term interest rates which reduced interest income earned on cash balances. The decrease in interest expense, net for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to decreased interest expenses as a result of the repayment of our $350 million 6.500% Senior Notes due April 2008 (the fiscal 1999 Senior Notes) and partial repurchase of our 4.750% Senior Notes due December 2009. 29 Table of Contents Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MDA and Note 8, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was approximately 34%, 37% and 38%, for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010, as compared with fiscal 2009, resulted primarily from the net charge incurred in fiscal 2009 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2010, which when taken together with fiscal 2010 reconciliations of tax returns to tax provisions, resolutions of uncertain tax positions relating to non U.S. jurisdictions and refinements of estimates ascribed to tax positions taken in prior periods relating to our international tax profile, resulted in a net benefit of $10 million for fiscal 2010 and, in our view, continues our efforts to improve our long term tax profile. The income tax provision recorded for fiscal 2009 includes a net charge of $22 million, which is primarily attributable to adjustments to uncertain tax positions (including certain refinements of amounts ascribed to tax positions taken in prior periods), partially offset by the reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Development Tax Credit and the settlement of a U.S. federal income tax audit for the fiscal years 2001 through 2004. As a result of this settlement, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, we recognized a tax benefit of $11 million and a reduction of goodwill by $10 million. The income tax provision recorded for fiscal 2008 included charges of $26 million associated with certain corporate income tax rate reductions enacted in various non U.S. tax jurisdictions (with corresponding impacts on our net deferred tax assets). As enacted income tax rates decline, the future value of the deferred tax assets declines, giving rise to a charge through the corporate income tax provision in the current period. Accordingly, deferred tax assets were adjusted to reflect the enacted rates in effect when the temporary items are expected to reverse. No provision has been made for U.S. federal income taxes on $1,067 million and $958 million as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we plan to permanently reinvest all such earnings outside the U.S. It is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such unremitted earnings. Refer to Note 10, Income Taxes, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Selected Quarterly Information.

Also includes a net charge of $24 million from certain tax items and $8 million attributable to tax rate changes, recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2010. (2) Includes after tax charges of $58 million for severance and other expenses in connection with restructuring plans for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. Refer to Restructuring and Other within the Results of Operations section of this MDA for additional information. Also includes a net charge of $16 million from certain tax items and $25 million attributable to refinements of tax positions taken in prior periods, recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2009. 30 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash balances, including cash equivalents, are held by numerous subsidiaries throughout the world, with 46% residing outside the United States at March 31, 2010. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,583 million as of March 31, 2010, representing a decrease of $129 million from the March 31, 2009 balance of $2,712 million. We expect that existing cash and cash equivalents, the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines, and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. We expect to use existing cash balances and future cash generated from operations to fund capital spending, financing activities such as the repayment of our debt balances as they mature, the payment of dividends, and the potential repurchase of shares of common stock in accordance with any plans approved by our Board of Directors, as well as our continued investment in our enterprise resource planning implementation and future acquisitions. Sources and Uses of Cash Cash generated by operating activities, which represents our primary source of liquidity, increased $148 million in fiscal 2010 to $1,360 million from $1,212 million in fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, accounts receivable decreased by $9 million, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, compared with a decline in the comparable prior year period of $199 million. For fiscal 2010, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased $21 million, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, compared with a decrease in the comparable prior year period of $75 million. Under our subscription and maintenance agreements, customers generally make installment payments over the term of the agreement, often with one payment due at contract execution, for the right to use our software products and receive product support, software fixes and new products when available. The timing and actual amounts of cash received from committed customer installment payments under any specific agreement can be affected by several factors, including the time value of money and the customers credit rating. Often, the amount received is the result of direct negotiations with the customer when establishing pricing and payment terms. In certain instances, the customer negotiates a price for a single installment payment and seeks its own internal or external financing sources. In other instances, we may assist the customer by arranging financing on the customers behalf through a third party financial institution. Alternatively, we may decide to transfer our rights to the future committed installment payments due under the license agreement to a third party financial institution in exchange for a cash payment. Once transferred, the future committed installments are payable by the customer to the third party financial institution. Whether the future committed installments have been financed directly by the customer with our assistance or by the transfer of our rights to future committed installments to a third party, such financing agreements may contain limited recourse provisions with respect to our continued performance under the license agreements. Based on our historical experience, we believe that any liability that we may incur as a result of these limited recourse provisions will be immaterial. Amounts billed or collected as a result of a single installment for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, rather than being invoiced and collected over the life of the license agreement are reflected in the liability section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Deferred revenue (billed or collected). Amounts received from either the customer or a third party financial institution in the current period that are attributable to later years of a license agreement have a positive effect on billings and cash provided by operating activities. Accordingly, to the extent such collections are attributable to the later years of a license agreement, billings and cash provided by operating activities during the licenses later years will be lower than if the payments were received over the license term. We are unable to predict with certainty the amount of cash to be collected from single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, under new or renewed license agreements to be executed in future periods. For fiscal 2010, gross receipts related to single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, were $484 million, compared with $526 million in fiscal 2009. Cash provided by operating activities typically increases in each consecutive quarter throughout the fiscal year in accordance with our bookings cycle, with the fourth quarter being the highest and the first quarter being the lowest. The timing of net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year is also affected by many other factors, including the timing of any customer financing or transfer of our interest in contractual installments and the level and timing of expenditures. In any quarter, we may receive payments in advance of the contractually committed date on which the payments were otherwise due. In limited circumstances, we may offer discounts to customers to ensure payment in the current period of 31 Table of Contents invoices that have been billed, but might not otherwise be paid until a subsequent period because of payment terms or other factors. Historically, any such discounts have not been material. Our estimate of the fair value of net installment accounts receivable recorded for license agreements signed prior to October 2000 (the prior business model) approximates carrying value. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for additional information regarding the prior business model. Amounts due from customers under our subscription license model are offset by deferred revenue related to these license agreements, leaving no or minimal net carrying value for such amounts. The fair value of such amounts may exceed, equal, or be less than this carrying value but cannot be practically assessed since there is no existing market for a pool of customer receivables with contractual commitments similar to those owned by us. The actual fair value may not be known until these amounts are sold, securitized or collected. Although these customer license agreements commit the customer to payments under a fixed schedule, to the extent amounts are not yet due and payable by the customer, the agreements are considered executory in nature due to our ongoing commitment to provide maintenance and unspecified future software products as part of the agreement terms. For further information on our installment accounts receivable, refer to Note 6, Trade and Installment Accounts Receivable in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We can estimate the total amounts to be billed from committed contracts, referred to as our billings backlog, and the total amount to be recognized as revenue from committed contracts, referred to as our revenue backlog.

MARCH 31, MARCH 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2010 2009 Expected future cash collections: Total billings backlog $ 4,587 $ 3,947 Trade and installment accounts receivable current, net 931 839 Installment accounts receivable noncurrent, net 46 128 Total expected future cash collections $ 5,564 $ 4,914 The increases in our current and non current revenue and billings backlogs as well as our expected future cash collections were driven by the increased committed value associated with customer contracts. Revenue to be recognized in the next 12 months increased 7% at March 31, 2010 as compared with March 31, 2009. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, revenue to be recognized in the next 12 months increased by 4% at March 31, 2010 as compared with March 31, 2009. 32 Table of Contents Unbilled amounts relating to subscription licenses are mostly collectible over a period of one to five years. As of March 31, 2010, on a cumulative basis, 41%, 71%, 88%, 98%, and 100% of amounts due from customers recorded under our business model come due within fiscal 2011 through 2015, respectively.

(2) Amounts include interest, restructuring and miscellaneous receipts and disbursements. Fiscal Year 2010 versus Fiscal Year 2009 Operating Activities: Cash generated by operating activities for fiscal 2010 was $1,360 million, representing an increase of $148 million compared with fiscal 2009. The increase was driven primarily by lower vendor disbursements and payroll of $116 million which was mostly due to decreased operating costs. Investing Activities: Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2010 was $888 million compared with $284 million for fiscal 2009. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the increase in acquisition related costs of $541 million and an increase in capitalized software development costs of $59 million from the reallocation of resources previously spent on maintenance to new development projects and incremental development expenditures on acquired products and other strategic investments. Financing Activities: Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 was $705 million compared with $759 million in fiscal 2009. The primary changes in cash used in financing activities were an increase in debt repayments of $525 million and an increase in repurchases of our common stock of $223 million, offset by $744 million of debt borrowings, net of debt issuance costs of $6 million and proceeds of $61 million received from the exercise of a call spread option associated with our 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009. During fiscal 2009, we repaid the remaining $350 million principal amount of our 6.500% Senior Notes that was due and we also repurchased $148 million principal amount of our 4.750% Senior Notes due 2009 at a price of $143 million in cash. Refer to the Debt Arrangements table below for additional information about our debt balances at March 31, 2010. Fiscal Year 2009 versus Fiscal Year 2008 Operating Activities: Cash generated by operating activities for fiscal 2009 was $1,212 million, representing an increase of $109 million compared with fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to a reduction of $212 million in vendor disbursements and payroll due to increased operating efficiencies and $78 million received from settlements of derivative contracts primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro. The amounts received from the settlements of derivative contracts were mostly offset by the reduced value in dollars of net cash received due to foreign exchange movements. These increases were partially offset by a $225 million decrease in cash collections from billings, mostly due to a $115 million decrease in single installment payments. 33 Table of Contents Investing Activities: Cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2009 was $284 million compared with $219 million for fiscal 2008. Increases in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and capitalized software development costs of $49 million and $17 million, respectively, and a $27 million reduction due to proceeds from a sale leaseback transaction that were realized in fiscal 2008 that did not recur in fiscal 2009. These increases were partially offset by reduced purchases of property and equipment of $34 million. Financing Activities: Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2009 was $759 million compared with $572 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the partial repayment of $324 million principal amount of our 4.750% Senior Notes due 2009 during the second half of fiscal 2009. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we repaid the remaining $350 million principal amount of our 6.500% Senior Notes that was due and payable at that time. Refer to the Debt Arrangements table below for additional information concerning our outstanding debt balances at March 31, 2009. Partially offsetting the debt repayments in fiscal 2009 was a decrease in common stock repurchases. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased $4 million of our own common stock, compared with $500 million in fiscal 2008. As of March 31, 2010 and 2009, our debt arrangements consisted of the following: MARCH 31, 2010 MARCH 31, 2009 MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING (IN MILLIONS) AVAILABLE BALANCE AVAILABLE BALANCE Debt Arrangements: 2008 Revolving Credit Facility (expires August 2012) $ 1,000 $ 250 $ 1,000 $ 750 5.375% Senior Notes due November 2019 750 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009, net of debt amortization amount of $29 million 431 4.750% Senior Notes due December 2009 176 6.125% Senior Notes due December 2014 501 500 International line of credit 25 25 Capital lease obligations and other 44 51 Total $ 1,545 $ 1,908 During fiscal 2010, we repaid $500 million of borrowing under our 2008 Revolving Credit Facility, which expires in August 2012, $176 million of our 4.750% Senior Notes due December 2009, and $520 million of our 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes (1.625% Notes), of which approximately $460 million was for the outstanding principal of the debt and approximately $60 million was for the in the money conversion feature. The $60 million was recorded in Additional paid in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These repayments are included in Net cash used in financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for fiscal 2010. Concurrent with the original issuance of the 1.625% Notes in 2002, we entered into call spread repurchase option transactions (1.625% Notes Call Spread) to partially mitigate potential dilution from the conversion of the 1.625% Notes. We exercised the 1.625% Notes Call Spread in December 2009, resulting in option proceeds of approximately $61 million, which was recorded in Additional paid in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2010 and is included in Net cash used in financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, we issued approximately $750 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2019 (the 5.375% Senior Notes). The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $738 million, after being issued at a discount of $6 million and deducting expenses, underwriting discounts and commissions of $6 million, all of which will be amortized over the term of the 5.375% Senior Notes. As of March 31, 2010, the principal amount of the 5.375% Senior Notes of $744 million, net of unamortized debt discount of $6 million, is included in the Long term debt, net of current portion line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2010, we entered into three $100 million notional amount interest rate swap transactions to swap a portion of our fixed interest rate payments from our 6.125% Senior Notes due December 2014 into floating interest rate payments 34 Table of Contents through December 1, 2014. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay quarterly interest at rates of 2.915%, 2.779% and 2.999% on the first, second and third swap, respectively, plus the three month LIBOR rate, and will receive interest payments at 5.625%, which is consistent with the original stated coupon at issuance. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. The change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps from inception to March 31, 2010 was approximately $1 million and is reflected in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The carrying value of the debt was adjusted by an equal and offsetting amount. As of March 31, 2010, the Companys senior unsecured notes were rated Baa3, BBB, and BBB by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), Standard and Poors (SP) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch), respectively. As of March 31, 2010 the outlook on these unsecured notes is rated stable by all three rating agencies. For further information on our debt balances, refer to Note 8, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Repurchases During fiscal 2010, we entered into brokerage arrangements with third party financial institutions to purchase our common stock in the open market on our behalf. We acquired approximately 10.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $227 million under these arrangements during fiscal 2010. As of March 31, 2010, we were authorized to purchase an aggregate amount of up to approximately $19 million of additional shares of common stock under our current stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount of approximately $19 million was repurchased during April 2010, which completed the stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors on October 29, 2008. On May 12, 2010, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to acquire up to $500 million of our common stock. We will fund the program with available cash on hand and repurchase shares on the open market from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Dividends We have paid cash dividends each year since July 1990. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid annual cash dividends of $0.16 per share, which have been paid out in quarterly installments of $0.04 per share as and when declared by our Board of Directors. Total cash dividends paid was $83 million, $83 million and $82 million for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Effect of Exchange Rate Changes There was a $104 million favorable effect to our cash balances in fiscal 2010 predominantly due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar of 32%, 29% and 24%, respectively. There was a $252 million unfavorable effect to our cash balances in fiscal 2009 predominantly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar of 16%, 28%, 24%, 24% and 19%, respectively. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Prior to fiscal 2001, we sold individual accounts receivable to a third party subject to certain recourse provisions. The outstanding principal balance subject to recourse of these receivables approximated $21 million and $38 million as of March 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Other than the commitments and recourse provisions described above, we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and, accordingly, off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with current accounting rules, the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business. 35 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of March 31, 2010 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. In addition, the table summarizes the timing of payments on our debt obligations as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2010.

(2) Includes $3 million of estimated liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits under the less than 1 year column for amounts that are estimated to be settled within one year of the balance sheet date. In addition, $398 million of estimated liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of when such amounts will become payable could not be made. As of March 31, 2010, we have no material capital lease obligations, either individually or in the aggregate. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that effect our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. We consider the following significant accounting policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources: (1) licensing software products; (2) providing customer technical support (referred to as maintenance); and (3) providing professional services, such as product implementation, consulting and education. Revenue is recorded net of applicable sales taxes. Under our subscription model, implemented in October 2000, software license agreements typically combine the right to use specified software products, the right to maintenance, and the right to receive and use unspecified future software products for no additional fee during the term of the agreement. For these subscription licenses we are required under GAAP to recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement once all four of the following revenue recognition criteria are met: (1) we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer; (2) we deliver the specified products; (3) license agreement terms are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final; and (4) collection is probable. Our subscription customers generally make installment payments for the right to use our software products over the term of the associated software license agreement. While the timing of revenue recognition is affected by the offering of unspecified future software products, it generally has not changed the timing of how we bill and collect cash from customers and as a result, our cash generated from operations has generally not been affected by the offering of unspecified future software products. For license agreements signed under the prior business model, once all four of the above noted revenue recognition criteria were met, software license fees were recognized as revenue generally when the software was delivered to the customer, or up front (as the contracts did not include a right to unspecified future software products), and the maintenance fees were deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the term of the license. 36 Table of Contents Revenue from professional service arrangements is generally recognized as the services are performed. Revenue and costs from committed professional services that are sold as part of a software license agreement are deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the life of the related software transaction. Vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of professional services is established based on daily rates when sold on a stand alone basis. If it is not probable that a project will be completed or the payment will be received, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed. Software fees and other revenue primarily consist of revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses that do not include the right to unspecified software products on a stand alone basis or in a bundled arrangement where VSOE exists for any undelivered elements. This includes revenue generated through transactions with distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives (sometimes referred to as the Companys indirect or channel revenue) and certain revenue associated with new or acquired products sold on an up front basis. For bundle arrangements that include either maintenance or both maintenance and professional services, we use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized. Under the residual method, consideration is allocated to undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those elements, with the residual of the arrangement fee allocated to and recognized as license revenue. We have established VSOE of the fair value of maintenance from either contractually stated renewal rates or using the bell shaped curve method. In the event that agreements with our customers are executed in close proximity of the other license agreements with the same customer, we evaluate whether the separate arrangements are linked, and, if so, are considered a single multi element arrangement for which revenue is recognized ratably as Subscription and maintenance revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Some of our revenue from software licenses, including some newly developed and recently acquired products, is recognized on an up front basis, subject to meeting the same revenue recognition criteria as described above. Software fees from such licenses are recognized up front and are reported in the Software fees and other line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Maintenance fees from such licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the license and are reported in the Subscription and maintenance revenue line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. License agreements under which software fees are recognized up front do not include the right to receive unspecified future software products. Our historical practice with respect to newly acquired products with established VSOE of fair value has been to record revenue initially on the acquired companys systems, generally under an up front model; and, starting within the first fiscal year after the acquisition, to enter new licenses for such products under our subscription model, following which revenue is recognized ratably and recorded as Subscription and maintenance revenue. More recently, we have been selling some of our products without the right to receive unspecified future software products in certain instances. The software license fees from these contracts are recorded on an up front basis as Software fees and other as described above. Selling such licenses under an up front model will result in higher total revenue in a reporting period than if such licenses were based on our subscription model and the associated revenue recognized ratably. We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in license agreements that include software products for which maintenance pricing is based on both discounted and undiscounted license list prices and arrangements that contain rights to unspecified future software products. If VSOE of fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, license revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when VSOE of fair value can be established. When the license includes the right to receive unspecified future software products, license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as VSOE does not exist for the future unspecified software products. Revenue from sales to distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives commences when all four of the revenue recognition criteria noted above are met and when these entities sell the software product to their customers. This is commonly referred to as the sell through method. We have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under such agreements. We assess collectability based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed through the receipt of cash payment. Our standard licensing agreements include a product warranty provision for all products. The likelihood that we will be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions is considered remote. 37 Table of Contents Under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements, we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on, among other things, allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. In most cases and where legally enforceable, the indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer. In most cases, in the event of an infringement claim, we retain the right to (i) procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product; (ii) replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be reasonably achieved, we may terminate the license agreement and refund to the customer a pro rata portion of the fees paid. We consider the likelihood that we will be required to make refunds to customers under such provisions to be remote. Accounts Receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is a valuation account used to reserve for the potential impairment of accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts, we rely on several factors, including: Historical information, such as general collection history of multi year software agreements; Current customer information and events, such as extended delinquency, requests for restructuring, and filings for bankruptcy; Results of analyzing historical and current data; and The overall macroeconomic environment. The allowance includes two components: (a) specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when, based on current information, we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer; and (b) an allowance for losses inherent in the remaining receivable portfolio based on historical activity. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, along with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. We utilize a more likely than not threshold for the recognition and derecognition of tax positions and measure positions accordingly. We reflect changes in recognition or measurement in a period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Goodwill, Capitalized Software Products, and Other Intangible Assets GAAP requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life. Absent any prior indicators of impairment, we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We evaluate goodwill impairment based on a single reporting unit. The goodwill impairment model is a two step process. The first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination; that is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. 38 Table of Contents The fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test is measured using the quoted market price method. Determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. These estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management. This approach uses significant assumptions, including projected future cash flow, the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flow, and a terminal growth rate. We performed our annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and concluded that no impairment charge was required. The carrying values of capitalized software products, for purchased software, internally developed software and other intangible assets are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that any excess of the carrying value over the net realizable value is written off. The facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the future recoverability of the cost of other intangible assets as of the balance sheet date. It is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or, if such an impairment were to occur, the magnitude thereof. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are subject to amortization over the expected period of economic benefit to us. We evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. In cases where a revision to the remaining amortization period is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. Accounting for Business Combinations The allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Product Development and Enhancements GAAP specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates. If other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility, the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been affected. Annual amortization of capitalized software costs is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product, generally estimated to be five years from the date the product became available for general release to customers. We amortize capitalized software costs using the straight line method. Accounting for Stock Based Compensation We currently maintain several stock based compensation plans. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain stock based awards. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk free interest rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock based compensation expense could have been materially affected. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially affected in future years. As described in Note 11, Stock Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, performance share units (PSUs) are awards under the long term incentive programs for senior executives where the number of shares or restricted shares, as applicable, ultimately received by the employee depends on Company performance measured against specified targets and will be determined after a three year or one year period, as applicable. The fair value of each award is estimated on the date that the performance targets are established based on the fair value of our stock and our estimate of the level of achievement of our performance targets. We are required to recalculate the fair value of issued PSUs each reporting period 39 Table of Contents until the underlying shares are granted. The adjustment is based on the quoted market price of our stock on the reporting period date. Each quarter, we compare the actual performance we expect to achieve with the performance targets. Legal Contingencies We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability of a loss and the determination as to whether the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, the decision to record an accrual and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims, and may revise our estimates. Such revisions could have a material effect on our results of operations. Refer to Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material legal proceedings. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009 13 (previously Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 08 1, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables). ASU 2009 13 superseded EITF No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, and addresses criteria for separating the consideration in certain multiple element arrangements. ASU 2009 13 will require companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of VSOE or other third party evidence of the selling price. ASU 2009 13 will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and early adoption will be permitted. The adoption of ASU 2009 13 will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In September 2009, the FASB ratified ASC ASU 2009 14 (previously EITF No. 09 3, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements). ASU 2009 14 modifies the scope of software revenue recognition to exclude (a) non software components of tangible products and (b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or leased with tangible products when the software components and non software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality. ASU 2009 14 has an effective date that is consistent with ASU 2009 13. The adoption of ASU 2009 14 will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, debt, and installment accounts receivable. We have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in liquid investments that are composed of money market funds and debt instruments of government agencies and high quality corporate issuers (SP single A rating and higher). To mitigate risk, all of the securities have a maturity date within one year, and holdings of any one issuer do not exceed 10% of the portfolio. As of March 31, 2010, our outstanding debt was $1,545 million, all of which was in fixed rate obligations except for our 2008 Revolving Credit Facility which had a $250 million balance as of March 31, 2010 (Refer to Note 8, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). During fiscal year 2009, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $250 million to hedge the variable interest rate payments relating to the 2008 Revolving Credit Facility. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, we will pay interest at an annualized rate of 2.70% and 2.95% and receive interest payment at the one month LIBOR rate. During fiscal 2010, we entered into three interest rate swap transactions to swap a total of $300 million of our 6.125% Senior Notes (the 6.125% Notes) due December 2014 into floating interest rate debt through December 1, 2014. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay quarterly interest at a rate of 2.915%, 2.779% and 2.999% on the first, second and third swap, respectively, plus the three month LIBOR rate, and will receive payment at 5.625%. The LIBOR base rate is set quarterly three months prior to date of the interest payment. The change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps from 40 Table of Contents inception to March 31, 2010 was approximately $1 million and is reflected in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of the debt was adjusted by an equal and offsetting amount. Each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have a corresponding effect on the annual interest expense related to our interest rates swaps that relate to the 6.125% Notes of less than $1 million as of March 31, 2010. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in 46 countries and, as such, a portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing expected local currency revenues in relation to local currency costs and local currency assets in relation to local currency liabilities. In October 2005, our Board of Directors adopted our Risk Management Policy and Procedures, which authorize us to manage, based on managements assessment, our risks and exposures to foreign currency exchange rates through the use of derivative financial instruments (e.g., forward contracts, options and swaps) or other means. We only use derivative financial instruments in the context of hedging and do not use them for speculative purposes. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we did not designate our foreign exchange derivatives as hedges. Accordingly, all foreign exchange derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and unrealized or realized changes in fair value from these contracts are recorded as Other expenses (gains), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 4, Derivatives and Fair Value Measurement, for additional information regarding our derivative activities. If foreign currency exchange rates affecting our business weakened by 10% on an overall basis in comparison to the U.S. dollar, the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would report in U.S. dollars would decrease by approximately $119 million.
