ITEM 7. Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Introduction This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MDA) is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations. This MDA should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K and the Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Business overview We are the leading independent enterprise information technology (IT) management software and solutions company with expertise across IT environments from mainframe and physical to virtual and cloud. We develop and deliver software and services that help organizations manage, secure and automate their IT infrastructures and deliver more flexible IT services. This allows companies to more effectively and efficiently respond to business needs. We address components of the computing environment, including people, information, processes, systems, networks, applications and databases, regardless of the hardware or software customers are using. We license our products worldwide. We service companies across most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers, government agencies, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational organizations and health care institutions. These customers typically maintain IT infrastructures that are both complex and central to their objectives for operational excellence. We are the leading independent software vendor in the mainframe space, and we continue to innovate on the mainframe platform, which runs many of our largest customers most important applications. As the IT landscape continues to evolve, more companies are seeking to improve the efficiency and availability of their IT resources and applications through virtualization, which enables users to run multiple virtual machines on each physical machine and thereby reduce operating costs associated with physical infrastructure. Virtualization is essential to the evolution of cloud computing, the on demand access to a shared pool of computing resources that can be configured and used as needed. At the same time, the consumption of IT assets is evolving through the adoption of Software as a Service (SaaS), where customers can obtain software on a subscription, pay as you go model. As more companies begin to adopt virtualization and cloud computing, data centers are becoming more complex, with mainframes, physical servers, virtualized servers and private, public and hybrid (a combination of public and private) cloud environments. As a result of this heightened complexity, we believe it is essential for companies to effectively manage and secure all of their various computing environments. We have a broad portfolio of software solutions that address customer needs, including mainframe; service assurance; security (identity and access management); project and portfolio management; service management; virtualization and service automation; and cloud computing. We deliver our products on premises or, for certain products, using SaaS. Our strategy is to help our customers manage, secure and automate IT and to make us their strategic partner as they deploy new technologies and maximize their investments in current systems and applications. This strategy emphasizes accelerating our growth by continuing to build on our portfolio of software and services to address customer needs in the above mentioned areas of focus through a combination of internal development and acquired technologies. We believe this strategy builds on our core strengths in IT management while also positioning us to compete in high growth markets, including virtualization, cloud and SaaS. We are also seeking to expand our business beyond our traditional core customers, generally consisting of large enterprises, to reach what we refer to as emerging enterprises or growth accounts (which we define as companies with revenue of $300 million to $2 billion) and customers in emerging geographies or growth geographies. We are increasing the number of our relationships and expanding existing relationships with various types of service providers, particularly global outsourcers, regional managed service providers and communication network operators. To enable us to execute our growth strategy more effectively, we have: Completed several key acquisitions during fiscal 2011 in an effort to expand our product portfolio, including Arcot Systems, Inc. (Arcot), Torokina Pty Ltd, and Hyperformix, Inc.; 22 Table of Contents Announced the availability of several innovations, including CA Mainframe Chorus, CA Automation Suite, CA 3Tera AppLogic, and five new products in our CA Virtual Suite; Enhanced our abilities to address both our growth accounts and growth geographies with the introduction of new SaaS, virtualization, cloud computing and security solutions, including technologies from our fiscal 2010 acquisition of Nimsoft AS (Nimsoft) and our fiscal 2011 acquisition of Arcot; Aligned our organization to be more responsive to customer needs and emerging trends through the combination of the assets we have developed and those that we have acquired; Re branded our company; and Increased the number of product and capacity sales, both outside of and in connection with renewals. As our growth strategy has evolved, our management also looks within bookings at total new product and capacity sales, which we define as sales of products or capacity that are new or in addition to products or capacity previously contracted for by a customer. The amount of new product and capacity sales for a period, as currently tracked by us, requires estimation by management and has not been historically reported. Within a given period, the amount of new product and capacity sales may not be material to the change in our total bookings or revenue compared with prior periods. New product and capacity sales can be reflected as subscription and maintenance bookings in the period (for which revenue would be recognized ratably over the term of the contract) or in software fees and other bookings (which are recognized as software fees and other revenue in the current period). CA Technologies business model We generate revenue from the following sources: license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis; maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements; and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation, consulting and education. The timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a reporting period are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Revenue is reported net of applicable sales taxes. Under our business model, we offer customers a wide range of licensing options, including the flexibility to license software under month to month licenses or to fix their costs by committing to longer term agreements. Licenses sold for most of our software products permit customers to change their software product mix as their business and technology needs change and include the right to receive software products in the future within defined product lines for no additional fee, commonly referred to as unspecified future software products, as well as maintenance included during the term of each license. In some instances, we sell certain products without the right to receive unspecified future software products. Executive summary The following is a summary of the analysis of our results contained in our MDA. During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we sold our Information Governance business, consisting primarily of the CA Records Manager and CA Message Manager software offerings and related professional services. At the end of fiscal 2011, we identified our Internet Security business as available for sale, and on April 28, 2011 signed an agreement for the sale of this business. The results of these business operations are presented in income from discontinued operations for all periods. Total revenue backlog at March 31, 2011 of $8,763 million increased 8% compared with $8,125 million at March 31, 2010. The current portion of revenue backlog represents revenue to be recognized within the next 12 months. The current portion of revenue backlog at March 31, 2011 of $3,727 million increased by 7% compared with the balance of $3,469 million at March 31, 2010. Generally, we believe that an increase in the current portion of revenue backlog is a positive indicator of future revenue growth. Total bookings in fiscal 2011 increased 1% to $4,888 million compared with $4,843 million from the prior period, due primarily to favorable results for new product sales in connection with software fees and other bookings (recognized as software fees and other revenue in the current period), which was partially offset by a decrease in subscription and maintenance bookings for fiscal 2011. Total new product sales and mainframe capacity grew in the low single digits for the fiscal year. Within new product and capacity sales in fiscal 2011, the increase in new distributed products was partially offset by a decrease in mainframe capacity and new mainframe product sales. Generally, total new product and capacity sales consist of new sales of distributed products, mainframe products and mainframe capacity. Renewal bookings increased 23 Table of Contents sequentially during fiscal 2011, which was consistent with our expectation that our renewal portfolio would increase in the second half of fiscal 2011. Our fiscal 2011 bookings included a license agreement renewal with one large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million, which was signed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Excluding this one agreement, renewal bookings increased sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. However, without this agreement, renewal bookings would have been down approximately 15% for fiscal 2011. This was partially due to the timing of certain license agreement renewals that are now expected to occur during fiscal 2012, such as one renewal for approximately $100 million that was executed in April 2011. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, renewal yield did not differ materially from its recent percentage range of the high 80s to low 90s. We currently expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be approximately 20 percent lower than fiscal 2011. Total revenue for fiscal 2011 grew 5% to $4,429 million compared with $4,227 million in the prior period, primarily due to growth in U.S. revenue of $182 million, or 8%. Lower revenue in Europe, Middle East and Africa was offset by revenue growth in the Asia Pacific Japan and Latin America regions. Our revenue growth was evenly split between revenue from existing products and services and revenue from acquired technologies (which we define as technology acquired within the prior 12 months). Revenue from software fees and other for fiscal 2011 increased by $106 million, or 61%, compared with the prior period, primarily due to revenue from the successful integration of service assurance technologies associated with one of our fiscal 2010 acquisitions into our existing product portfolio. Subscription and maintenance revenue for fiscal 2011 increased primarily due to revenue associated with our fiscal 2010 acquisitions and professional services revenues for fiscal 2011 increased by 14% compared with the prior period. Total expense before interest and income taxes of $3,175 million grew 6%, compared with $2,999 million in the prior period. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with our fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions and an increase in selling and marketing costs, partially offset by the decrease in general and administrative costs. We may experience similar additional costs associated with any future acquisitions. In fiscal 2010, we incurred restructuring costs of $50 million associated with our fiscal 2010 restructuring plan, which did not occur in the current period. Income before interest and income taxes increased $26 million, or 2%, in fiscal 2011. Tax expense decreased $7 million compared with the prior period, primarily as a result of nonrecurring discrete items. Diluted income from continuing operations per share for fiscal 2011 was $1.60, compared with $1.45 in the prior period, primarily reflecting an increase in operating income, continued improvements in our income tax rate and the Companys repurchase of its common shares. For fiscal 2011, cash flow from continuing operating activities was $1,377 million and grew 3%, compared with $1,336 million in the prior period. This growth reflects both a year over year increase of $58 million in up front cash collections from single installment payments and an increase in collections on trade receivables of $63 million and a decrease in income tax payments of $107 million. This was partially offset by an increase in disbursements of $187 million, primarily attributable to acquisitions. Performance indicators Management uses several quantitative and qualitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition. Each provides a measurement of the performance of our business and how well we are executing our plan. Our predominantly subscription based business model is less common among our competitors in the software industry and it may be difficult to compare the results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors. The following is a summary of the principal performance indicators that management uses to review performance: YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, PERCENT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2011(1) 2010(1) CHANGE CHANGE Total revenue $ 4,429 $ 4,227 $ 202 5 % Subscription and maintenance revenue $ 3,822 $ 3,765 $ 57 2 % Net income $ 827 $ 771 $ 56 7 % Cash provided by operating activities continuing operations $ 1,377 $ 1,336 $ 41 3 % Total bookings $ 4,888 $ 4,843 $ 45 1 % Subscription and maintenance bookings $ 4,256 $ 4,322 $ (66 ) (2 )% Weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years 3.46 3.54 (0.08 ) (2 )% Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings $ 1,230 $ 1,221 $ 9 1 % 24 Table of Contents AT MARCH 31, PERCENT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 2011 2010 CHANGE CHANGE Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities(2) $ 3,228 $ 2,583 $ 645 25 % Total debt $ 1,551 $ 1,545 $ 6 Total expected future cash collections from committed contracts(1)(3) $ 6,043 $ 5,546 $ 497 9 % Total revenue backlog(1)(3) $ 8,763 $ 8,125 $ 638 8 % (1) Information presented excludes the results of our discontinued operations.

Analyses of our performance indicators, including general trends, can be found in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MDA. Total revenue Total revenue is the amount of revenue recognized during the reporting period from the sale of license, maintenance and professional services agreements. Amounts recognized as subscription and maintenance revenue are recognized ratably over the underlying term of the agreement. Professional services revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed or recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the related software license. Software fees and other revenue generally represents revenue recognized at the inception of a license agreement (upfront basis). Subscription and maintenance revenue Subscription and maintenance revenue is the amount of revenue recognized ratably during the reporting period from: (i) subscription license agreements that were in effect during the period, generally including maintenance that is bundled with and not separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, (ii) maintenance agreements associated with providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and upgrades that are separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, and (iii) license agreements bundled with additional products, maintenance or professional services for which Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (VSOE) has not been established. These amounts include the sale of products directly by us, as well as by distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives to end users, where the contracts incorporate the right for end users to receive unspecified future software products, and other contracts entered into in close proximity or contemplation of such agreements. Total bookings Total bookings includes the incremental value of all subscription, maintenance and professional services contracts and software fees and other contracts entered into during the reporting period and is generally reflective of the amount of products and services during the period that our customers have agreed to purchase from us. Revenue for bookings attributed to sales of software products for which revenue is recognized on an up front basis is reflected in the software fees and other line item of our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Subscription and maintenance bookings Subscription and maintenance bookings is the aggregate incremental amount we expect to collect from our customers over the terms of the underlying subscription and maintenance agreements entered into during a reporting period. These amounts include the sale of products directly by us and may include additional products, services or other fees for which we have not established VSOE of fair value. Subscription and maintenance bookings also includes indirect sales by distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives to end users, where the contracts incorporate the right for end users to receive unspecified future software products, and other contracts without these rights entered into in close proximity or contemplation of such agreements. These amounts are expected to be recognized ratably as subscription and maintenance revenue over the applicable term of the agreements. Subscription and maintenance bookings exclude the value associated with certain perpetual licenses, license only indirect sales and professional services arrangements. The license and maintenance agreements that contribute to subscription and maintenance bookings represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods that range generally from three to five years on a weighted average basis, although in certain cases customer commitments can be for longer or shorter periods. These current period bookings are often renewals of prior contracts that also had various durations, usually from three to five years. The amount of new subscription and maintenance bookings in a period is affected by the volume, duration and value of contracts renewed during that period. Our subscription and maintenance bookings typically increase in each consecutive quarter during a fiscal year, with the first quarter having the least bookings and the fourth quarter having the most bookings. However, subscription and maintenance 25 Table of Contents bookings may not always follow the pattern of increasing in consecutive quarters during a fiscal year, and the quarter to quarter differences in subscription and maintenance bookings may vary. Given the varying durations of the contracts being renewed, year over year comparisons of bookings are not always indicative of any overall bookings or revenue trend. Generally, we believe that an increase in the current portion of revenue backlog is a positive indicator of future revenue growth due to the high percentage of our revenue that is recognized from license agreements that are already committed and being recognized ratably. Within bookings, we also consider the yield on our renewal portfolio. We define renewal yield as the percentage of prior contract value realized from renewals during the period. The baseline for calculating renewal yield is an estimate affected by various factors including contractual renewal terms and other conditions. We estimate the yield based on a review of material transactions representing a substantial majority of the dollar value of renewals during the current period. Changes in renewal yield may not be material to changes in bookings compared with prior periods. Period to period changes in subscription and maintenance bookings do not necessarily correlate to changes in cash receipts. The contribution to current period revenue from subscription and maintenance bookings from any single license or maintenance agreement is relatively small, since revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable term for these agreements. Weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years reflects the duration of all subscription and maintenance agreements executed during a period, weighted by the total contract value of each individual agreement. Weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of license agreements entered into during a period. Weighted average duration information is disclosed in order to provide additional understanding of the volume of our bookings. Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings is an indicator that normalizes the bookings recorded in the current period to account for contract length. It is calculated by dividing the total value of all new subscription and maintenance license agreements entered into during a period by the weighted average subscription and license agreement duration in years for all such subscription and maintenance license agreements recorded during the same period. Total revenue backlog Total revenue backlog represents the aggregate amount we expect to recognize as revenue in the future as either subscription and maintenance revenue, professional services revenue or software fees and other revenue associated with contractually committed amounts billed or to be billed at the balance sheet date. Total revenue backlog is composed of amounts recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred revenue (billed or collected) as well as unearned amounts yet to be billed under subscription and maintenance and software fees and other agreements. Classification of amounts as current and non current depends on when such amounts are expected to be earned and therefore recognized as revenue. Amounts that are expected to be earned and therefore recognized as revenue in 12 months or less are classified as current, while amounts expected to be earned in more than 12 months are classified as noncurrent. The portion of total revenue backlog that relates to subscription and maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the underlying agreements and is reported as subscription and maintenance revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Generally, we believe that an increase in the current portion of revenue backlog is a positive indicator of future revenue growth. Deferred revenue (billed or collected) is composed of: (i) amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition, (ii) amounts billed but not collected for which revenue has not yet been earned and (iii) amounts received in advance of revenue recognition from financial institutions where we have transferred our interest in committed installments (referred to as Financing obligations and other in Note 8, Deferred Revenue in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements). 26 Table of Contents Results of operations The following table presents revenue and expense line items reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 and the period over period dollar and percentage changes for those line items.

Bookings For fiscal 2011 and 2010, total bookings were $4,888 million and $4,843 million, respectively. Total fiscal 2011 bookings included a license agreement with one large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million signed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The increase in bookings reflected favorable results for new product sales in connection with software fees and other bookings (recognized as software fees and other revenue in the current period), which was partially offset by a decrease in subscription and maintenance bookings for fiscal 2011, as described below. Total new product sales and mainframe capacity grew in the low single digits for the fiscal year. Within new product and capacity sales in fiscal 2011, the increase in new distributed products was partially offset by a decrease in mainframe capacity and new mainframe product sales. Bookings in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region declined due to the lower number of scheduled renewals and new product sales during fiscal 2011. This decline was mostly offset by growth in the United States. We expect the fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio in EMEA to be lower compared to fiscal 2011 and it will take a number of quarters to improve performance in this region. For fiscal 2010 and 2009, total bookings were $4,843 million and $5,113 million, respectively. The decrease in bookings was primarily due to the decrease in subscription and maintenance bookings for fiscal 2010, as described below. Subscription and maintenance bookings For the fiscal 2011 and 2010, we added subscription and maintenance bookings of $4,256 million and $4,322 million, respectively. The decrease in subscription and maintenance bookings was primarily attributable to a decrease in mainframe new product and capacity sales. During fiscal 2011, we renewed a total of 56 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $1,994 million. This includes a license agreement with one large IT outsourcer for 28 Table of Contents approximately $500 million signed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This license agreement extends through fiscal year 2016. During fiscal 2010, we renewed a total of 68 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $2,146 million. Generally, quarters with smaller renewal inventories result in a lower level of bookings because renewal bookings will be less and renewals remain an important selling opportunity for new products. Renewal bookings for the year, which generally does not include new product and capacity sales and professional services arrangements, ended flat compared to the prior year. Excluding one large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million, the renewals would have been down approximately 15%, primarily due to the timing of certain deals that were expected to be renewed in fiscal 2011 and are now expected to be renewed during fiscal 2012, including one contract for approximately $100 million that was executed in April 2011. We currently expect our fiscal 2012 renewal portfolio to be lower by approximately 20 percent compared to fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, annualized subscription and maintenance bookings increased from $1,221 million in the prior year period to $1,230 million. The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years decreased slightly from 3.54 in fiscal 2010 to 3.46 in fiscal 2011. Although each contract is subject to terms negotiated by the respective parties, we do not currently expect the weighted average duration of contracts to change materially from current levels for end user contracts. For fiscal 2010 and 2009, our subscription and maintenance bookings were $4,322 million and $4,657 million, respectively. The decrease in subscription and maintenance bookings for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to several large contract extensions with terms of approximately five years entered into during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, two of which had a combined contract value of approximately $550 million. During fiscal 2010, we renewed a total of 68 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $2,146 million. During fiscal 2009, we renewed a total of 68 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $2,471 million. For fiscal 2010, annualized subscription and maintenance bookings decreased $69 million from the prior year period to $1,221 million. The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years decreased slightly from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010, from 3.61 to 3.54, respectively. Revenue As more fully described below, the increase in total revenue in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to an increase in our software fees and other revenue and to a lesser extent an increase in subscription and maintenance revenue and professional services revenue. During fiscal 2011, revenue reflected a favorable foreign exchange effect of $4 million compared with fiscal 2010. The $89 million increase in total revenue for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a higher annualized value of customer contracts contributing to revenue during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of $32 million and a decrease in professional services revenue. Subscription and maintenance revenue The increase in subscription and maintenance revenue for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to revenue associated with our fiscal 2010 acquisitions of NetQoS, Inc. and Nimsoft AS (both of which occurred during the second half of fiscal 2010). For fiscal 2011, revenue reflected a favorable foreign exchange effect of less than $1 million. The increase in subscription and maintenance revenue for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a higher annualized value of customer contracts contributing to revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009, partially offset by a $32 million negative effect from foreign exchange. Professional services Professional services revenue primarily includes product implementation, customer training and customer education. Professional services revenue increased in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to the increased number of engagements under service contracts. The professional services revenue decrease for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily a result of our customers reduced discretionary spending due to the difficult economic environment. 29 Table of Contents Software fees and other Software fees and other revenue primarily consists of revenue that is recognized on an up front basis. This includes revenue associated with distributed products sold on an up front basis directly by our sales force or through transactions with distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives (sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue). Software fees and other revenue increased for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to $48 million in revenue from service assurance technologies associated with the NetQoS acquisition (which occurred during the second half of fiscal 2010) that were successfully integrated into our existing product portfolio, $36 million from existing application management products sold on an up front basis and $27 million from our SaaS offerings from a recent acquisition and other organic technologies sold as SaaS. Software fees and other revenue increased for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $39 million increase in revenue associated with acquired new products and existing application management products sold on an up front basis. Approximately $18 million of these revenues were from products of NetQoS, which was acquired during the second half of fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009 we recorded $5 million under the license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement with Rocket Software, Inc. that expires in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2010 we recorded $6 million from a renegotiated payment schedule under this agreement. Total revenue by geography The following table presents the amount of revenue earned from sales to unaffiliated customers in the United States and international regions and corresponding percentage changes for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009.

International revenue increased by $20 million, or 1% for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. Lower revenue in Europe, Middle East and Africa was offset by revenue growth in the Asia Pacific Japan and Latin America regions. Excluding a favorable foreign exchange effect of $4 million, international revenue would have increased by $16 million, or 1%. Revenue in the United States increased by 6% for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to a higher annual value of customer subscription and maintenance contracts. For fiscal 2010, international revenue decreased by approximately 2% compared with the prior period primarily due to the unfavorable effect from foreign exchange of $32 million. Price changes do not have a material effect on revenue in a given period as a result of our ratable subscription model. Expenses The overall increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to costs associated with our fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions and an increase in selling and marketing costs attributable to CA World, our user conference, partially offset by the decrease in general and administrative costs. In fiscal 2010, we incurred restructuring costs of $50 million associated with our fiscal 2010 restructuring plan, which did not occur in the current period. The overall decrease in operating expenses for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to lower restructuring costs partially offset by increased selling and marketing, general and administrative and other costs. Costs of licensing and maintenance Costs of licensing and maintenance includes technical support, royalties, and other manufacturing and distribution costs. The increase in costs of licensing and maintenance for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in cost of goods sold expense of $21 million from the acquired technologies related to the NetQoS acquisition. Costs of licensing and maintenance for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 decreased $8 million due to lower royalty fees offset by increases in product support expenses and other costs. 30 Table of Contents Cost of professional services Cost of professional services consist primarily of our personnel related costs associated with providing professional services. For fiscal 2011, the costs of professional services increased compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in services projects, as reflected by the $39 million increase in revenue. These costs increased at a higher rate than revenue primarily as a result of a higher mix of engagements that required additional effort to meet customer requirements during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. These engagements resulted in lower margins and as a result gross margins on professional services decreased to 7% for fiscal 2011, compared with 10% for fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2010, cost of professional services decreased compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to a $36 million decrease in consulting and personnel costs primarily due to lower sales volumes. Professional services gross margin for fiscal 2010 was 10% as compared with 14% for fiscal 2009 mostly due to lower utilization rates resulting from the decrease in sales. Amortization of capitalized software costs Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and internally generated capitalized software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software development costs relate to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage. For fiscal 2011, amortization of capitalized software costs increased compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to the increase in amortization expense associated with our fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions and the increase in activities relating to projects that have reached technological feasibility in recent periods. For fiscal 2010, amortization of capitalized software costs increased compared with fiscal 2009, principally due to the capitalizable value of projects that have reached technological feasibility in prior periods. Selling and marketing Selling and marketing expenses include the costs relating to our sales force, channel partners, corporate and business marketing and customer training programs. The increase in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of $46 million, of which $22 million primarily related to costs associated with our fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions. Promotional and travel costs increased by $39 million, primarily due to $20 million of costs associated with CA World, our user conference, and our re branding initiative. CA World occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and is our largest periodic promotional and marketing event that takes place approximately every 18 months. Included in the promotional and travel cost increase is $10 million of additional expenses that were associated with our fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions. A portion of the increase in personnel and promotion costs is associated with our continued investment in emerging enterprises and emerging geographies. The increase in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increased personnel costs of $20 million partially from acquired companies and higher commission costs of $30 million resulting from new product sales partially offset by reduced promotion expenses of $21 million, principally attributable to the timing of CA World, which took place in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. General and administrative General and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate and support functions, including our executive leadership and administration groups, finance, legal, human resources, corporate communications and other costs such as provisions for doubtful accounts. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily related to a decrease in personnel related and office costs of $29 million and consulting costs of $15 million. The decrease in personnel related expense was primarily due to lower financial performance attainment levels under our equity and cash compensation plans for fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, we incurred costs related to the departure of our Chief Executive Officer and the transition to his successor. These decreases were offset by increases in personnel costs of $20 million associated with our fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 increased $15 million primarily due to the aforementioned costs related to the departure of our Chief Executive Officer. We also incurred a $12 million increase in costs 31 Table of Contents attributable to acquisitions and other strategic initiatives partially offset by a $7 million reduction in bad debt expenses and other cost reductions. Product development and enhancements For fiscal 2011 and 2010, product development and enhancements expenses represented approximately 11% of total revenue. For fiscal 2011, product development and enhancements expenses were slightly higher primarily due additional costs incurred in our investment in technologies to support our growth strategy, as well as a broadening of our enterprise product offerings, partially offset against lower personnel costs. Product development and enhancements expenses for fiscal 2010 decreased from fiscal 2009 primarily due to an increase in resources dedicated to internally developed software for strategic investments in our security, mainframe and infrastructure management products, which are capitalized and reflected in the Capitalized software and other intangible assets, net line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Mostly offsetting this decrease in expenses were increased personnel costs, an increase in our investment in product development and enhancements for emerging technologies, and a broadening of our enterprise product offerings to build on our portfolio of software and services to meet next generation market opportunities. Depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets The increase in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses for acquired assets and fixed assets placed into service during fiscal 2011. The increase in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the increased value of fixed assets placed into service during fiscal 2010. Other expenses (gains), net Other expenses (gains), net includes gains and losses attributable to divested assets, foreign currency exchange rate changes and certain other items. YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2011 2010 2009 Gains attributable to divestitures of assets $ (11 ) $ (1 ) $ (5 ) Changes in foreign currency exchange rates 18 10 (11 ) Expenses attributable to litigation claims and settlements 9 5 15 Total $ 16 $ 14 $ (1 ) For fiscal 2011, Other expenses (gains), net included $14 million of losses relating to our foreign exchange derivative contracts, which we use to mitigate our operating risks and exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. These losses were offset by foreign currency transaction gains due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of other countries in which we conduct our operations. During fiscal 2011, we recognized $9 million of expenses in connection with litigation claims, partially offset by a $10 million gain associated with the sale of our interest in an investment. In fiscal 2010, we recorded net foreign exchange losses of $10 million. The foreign exchange amounts recorded in fiscal 2010 included net losses of $20 million associated with derivative contracts. These losses were offset by foreign currency transaction gains due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of other countries in which we conduct our operations. In fiscal 2009, we recorded net foreign exchange gains of $11 million. The foreign exchange amounts recorded in fiscal 2009 included net gains of $77 million associated with derivative foreign exchange contracts. These gains were mostly offset by foreign exchange losses from other operating activities due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of other countries in which we conduct our operations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we recognized a gain of $5 million associated with our repurchase of $148 million principal amount of our 4.750% Senior Notes. Restructuring and other The Fiscal 2010 Restructuring Plan (Fiscal 2010 Plan) was approved in March 2010. The Fiscal 2007 Restructuring Plan (Fiscal 2007 Plan) was approved in August 2006. 32 Table of Contents For fiscal 2011, we recorded a benefit of $2 million relating to adjustments to changes in estimated costs for our Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2007 Plans. For fiscal 2010 and 2009, we incurred expenses of $46 million and $96 million, respectively, primarily related to severance and lease abandonment and termination costs under the Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2007 Plans. At March 31, 2011, $55 million remained unpaid for both our Fiscal 2010 Plan and Fiscal 2007 Plan combined, which primarily consisted of accrued facilities abandonment charges. The severance portion of the remaining liability balance is included in the Accrued salaries, wages and commissions line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The facilities abandonment portion of the remaining liability balance is included in the Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Final payment of these amounts is dependent upon settlement with the works councils in certain non U.S. locations and our ability to negotiate lease terminations. Refer to Note 4, Restructuring, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal year 2011, we received $10 million in settlements of claims associated with previous stockholder derivative actions following the substitution of us as plaintiff in those actions. During fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, we recorded impairment charges of $3 million and $5 million, respectively, for software that was capitalized for internal use but was determined to be impaired. Interest expense, net The decrease in interest expense, net, for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense resulting from our overall decrease in debt. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we reduced our debt outstanding and increased our weighted average maturity, enhancing our capital structure and financial flexibility. The increase in interest expense, net for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a decline in short term interest rates which reduced interest income earned on cash balances. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MDA and Note 9, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 32%, 34% and 37%, for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010, resulted primarily from affirmative claims in the context of tax audits, resolutions of uncertain tax positions relating to non U.S. jurisdictions and the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Development Tax Credit in December 2010, partially offset by refinements of tax positions taken in prior periods. These items taken together resulted in a net benefit of $33 million for fiscal 2011 and we continue our efforts to improve our long term tax profile. The reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, resulted primarily from the net charge incurred in fiscal 2009 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2010, in addition to fiscal 2010 reconciliations of tax returns to tax provisions, resolutions of uncertain tax positions relating to non U.S. jurisdictions and refinements of estimates ascribed to tax positions taken in prior periods relating to our international tax profile. These items taken together resulted in a net benefit of $10 million for fiscal 2010. The income tax provision recorded for fiscal 2009 includes a net charge of $22 million, which is primarily attributable to adjustments to uncertain tax positions (including certain refinements of amounts ascribed to tax positions taken in prior periods), partially offset by the reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Development Tax Credit and the settlement of a U.S. federal income tax audit for fiscal 2001 through 2004. As a result of this settlement, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, we recognized a tax benefit of $11 million and a reduction of goodwill by $10 million. No provision has been made for U.S. federal income taxes on $1,198 million and $1,067 million at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we plan to permanently reinvest all such earnings outside the United States. It is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such unremitted earnings. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 33 Table of Contents Discontinued operations During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we sold our Information Governance business, consisting primarily of the CA Records Manager and CA Message Manager software offerings and related professional services, for $19 million. The Information Governance business results for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 included revenue of $3 million, $22 million and $24 million, respectively, and a loss from operations of $6 million, $1 million and less than $1 million, respectively. At the end of fiscal 2011, we identified our Internet Security business as available for sale and on April 28, 2011, we signed an agreement for the sale of the business. The Internet Security business results for fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 consisted of revenue of $83 million, $104 million and $109 million, respectively, and income from operations of $10 million, $13 million and $10 million, respectively. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(2) Includes after tax charges of $29 million for severance and other expenses in connection with restructuring plans for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. Refer to Restructuring and Other within the Results of Operations section of this MDA for additional information. Also includes a net charge of $24 million from certain tax items and $8 million attributable to tax rate changes, recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2010. Liquidity and capital resources Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with 47% held in our subsidiaries outside the United States at March 31, 2011. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3,228 million at March 31, 2011, representing an increase of $645 million from the March 31, 2010 balance of $2,583 million. The increase in cash was primarily due to the decrease in cash used in investing and financing activities for fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the reduction of cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by our investment in marketable securities in order to enhance the yield of our investments while maintaining the safety of our portfolio. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the cash utilized during fiscal 2010 to repay our debt outstanding, which enhanced our capital structure and financial flexibility. During fiscal 2011, there was an $89 million favorable translation effect from foreign currency exchange rates on cash held outside the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect that existing cash and cash equivalents, the availability of borrowings under existing and renewable credit lines, and cash expected to be provided from operations will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. We expect to use existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and future cash generated from operations to fund capital spending, financing activities such as the repayment of our debt balances as they mature, the 34 Table of Contents payment of dividends, and the potential repurchase of shares of common stock in accordance with any plans approved by our Board of Directors, as well as our continued investment in our enterprise resource planning implementation and future acquisitions. Sources and uses of cash Under our subscription and maintenance agreements, customers generally make installment payments over the term of the agreement, often with at least one payment due at contract execution, for the right to use our software products and receive product support, software fixes and new products when available. The timing and actual amounts of cash received from committed customer installment payments under any specific agreement can be affected by several factors, including the time value of money and the customers credit rating. Often, the amount received is the result of direct negotiations with the customer when establishing pricing and payment terms. In certain instances, the customer negotiates a price for a single up front installment payment and seeks its own internal or external financing sources. In other instances, we may assist the customer by arranging financing on their behalf through a third party financial institution. Alternatively, we may decide to transfer our rights to the future committed installment payments due under the license agreement to a third party financial institution in exchange for a cash payment. Once transferred, the future committed installments are payable by the customer to the third party financial institution. Whether the future committed installments have been financed directly by the customer with our assistance or by the transfer of our rights to future committed installments to a third party, such financing agreements may contain limited recourse provisions with respect to our continued performance under the license agreements. Based on our historical experience, we believe that any liability that we may incur as a result of these limited recourse provisions will be immaterial. Amounts billed or collected as a result of a single installment for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, rather than being invoiced and collected over the life of the license agreement are reflected in the liability section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Deferred revenue (billed or collected). Amounts received from either a customer or a third party financial institution that are attributable to later years of a license agreement have a positive impact on billings and cash provided by operating activities in the current period. Accordingly, to the extent such collections are attributable to the later years of a license agreement, billings and cash provided by operating activities during the licenses later years will be lower than if the payments were received over the license term. We are unable to predict with certainty the amount of cash to be collected from single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, under new or renewed license agreements to be executed in future periods. For fiscal 2011, gross receipts related to single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, were $542 million compared with $484 million in fiscal 2010. In any quarter, we may receive payments in advance of the contractually committed date on which the payments are otherwise due. In limited circumstances, we may offer discounts to customers to ensure payment in the current period of invoices that have been billed, but might not otherwise be paid until a subsequent period because of payment terms or other factors. Historically, any such discounts have not been material. Amounts due from customers under our business model are offset by deferred revenue related to these license agreements, leaving no or minimal net carrying value on the balance sheets for such amounts. The fair value of such amounts may exceed or be less than this carrying value but cannot be practically assessed since there is no existing market for a pool of customer receivables with contractual commitments similar to those owned by us. The actual fair value may not be known until these amounts are sold, securitized or collected. Although these customer license agreements commit the customer to payment under a fixed schedule, to the extent amounts are not yet due and payable by the customer, the agreements are considered executory in nature due to our ongoing commitment to provide maintenance and unspecified future software products as part of the agreement terms. We can estimate the total amounts to be billed from committed contracts, referred to as our billings backlog, and the total amount to be recognized as revenue from committed contracts, referred to as our revenue backlog. The aggregate amounts 35 Table of Contents of our billings backlog and trade and installment receivables already reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the amounts we expect to collect in the future from committed contracts. MARCH 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2011(1) 2010(1) Billings backlog: Amounts to be billed current $ 2,234 $ 1,881 Amounts to be billed noncurrent 2,960 2,688 Total billings backlog $ 5,194 $ 4,569 Revenue backlog: Revenue to be recognized within the next 12 months current $ 3,727 $ 3,469 Revenue to be recognized beyond the next 12 months noncurrent 5,036 4,656 Total revenue backlog $ 8,763 $ 8,125 Deferred revenue (billed or collected) $ 3,569 $ 3,556 Total billings backlog 5,194 4,569 Total revenue backlog $ 8,763 $ 8,125 (1) Information presented excludes the results of our discontinued operations. Note: Revenue backlog includes deferred subscription, maintenance and professional services revenue. We can also estimate the total cash to be collected in the future from committed contracts, referred to as our Expected future cash collections, by adding the total billings backlog to the current and noncurrent Trade Receivables, which represent amounts already billed but not collected, from our Consolidated Balance Sheets. MARCH 31, (IN MILLIONS) 2011 2010 Expected future cash collections: Total billings backlog(1) $ 5,194 $ 4,569 Trade and installment accounts receivable current, net 849 931 Installment accounts receivable noncurrent, net 46 Total expected future cash collections $ 6,043 $ 5,546 (1) Information presented excludes the results of our discontinued operations. The increases in our current and non current revenue and billings backlogs as well as our expected future cash collections were driven by the increased committed value associated with customer contracts. Revenue to be recognized in the next 12 months increased 7% at March 31, 2011 compared with March 31, 2010. This increase includes revenue to be recognized in future periods attributable to a license agreement with one large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million signed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This license agreement extends through fiscal year 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, revenue to be recognized in the next 12 months increased by 5% at March 31, 2011 compared with March 31, 2010. Unbilled amounts relating to subscription licenses are mostly collectible over a period of one to five years. At March 31, 2011, on a cumulative basis, 53%, 85%, 96%, 99% and 100% of amounts due from customers recorded under our business model come due within fiscal 2012 through 2016, respectively. 36 Table of Contents Cash Generated by operating activities YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, $ CHANGE (IN MILLIONS) 2011(1) 2010(1) 2009(1) 2011 / 2010 2010 / 2009 Cash collections from billings(2) $ 4,774 $ 4,653 $ 4,607 $ 121 $ 46 Vendor disbursements and payroll(2) (3,075 ) (2,896 ) (3,013 ) (179 ) 117 Income tax payments (222 ) (329 ) (351 ) 107 22 Other disbursements, net(3) (100 ) (92 ) (59 ) (8 ) (33 ) Cash generated by operating Activities $ 1,377 $ 1,336 $ 1,184 $ 41 $ 152 (1) Information presented excludes the results of our discontinued operations.

Fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 Operating activities: Cash generated by continuing operating activities for fiscal 2011 was $1,377 million, representing an increase of $41 million compared with fiscal 2010. This growth reflects a year over year increase of $58 million in up front cash collections from single installment payments, an increase in collections on trade receivables of $63 million and a decrease in income tax payments of $107 million. These favorable variances were mostly offset by an increase in disbursements of $187 million, primarily attributable to acquisitions. Investing activities: Cash used in continuing investing activities for fiscal 2011 was $700 million compared with $888 million for fiscal 2010. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in acquisition related costs of $365 million and a decrease in capitalized software costs of $18 million. These decreases were offset by our net investment in marketable securities of $181 million. Financing activities: Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2011 was $320 million compared with $705 million in fiscal 2010. The changes in cash used in financing activities were primarily due to the refinancing of our debt, which occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. At that time, we repaid debt of $1,196 million and issued debt, net of debt issuance costs, of $738 million and received proceeds of $61 million from the exercise of a call spread option associated with our 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009. During fiscal 2011, we purchased $235 million of our common stock, compared with $227 million in fiscal 2010. Refer to the Debt Arrangements table below for additional information about our debt balances at March 31, 2011. Fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 Operating activities: Cash generated by continuing operating activities for fiscal 2010 was $1,336 million, representing an increase of $152 million compared with fiscal 2009. The increase was driven primarily by lower vendor disbursements and payroll of $117 million which was mostly due to decreased operating costs. Investing activities: Cash used in continuing investing activities for fiscal 2010 was $888 million compared with $284 million for fiscal 2009. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the increase in acquisition related costs of $541 million and an increase in capitalized software development costs of $59 million from the reallocation of resources previously spent on maintenance of new development projects and incremental development expenditures on acquired products and other strategic investments. Financing activities: Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2010 was $705 million compared with $759 million in fiscal 2009. The primary changes in cash used in financing activities were an increase in debt repayments of $525 million and an increase in repurchases of our common stock of $223 million, offset by $744 million of debt borrowings, net of debt issuance costs of 37 Table of Contents $6 million and proceeds of $61 million received from the exercise of a call spread option associated with our 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009. During fiscal 2009, we repaid the remaining $350 million principal amount of our 6.500% Senior Notes that was due and we also repurchased $148 million principal amount of our 4.750% Senior Notes due 2009 at a price of $143 million in cash. Refer to the Debt Arrangements table below for additional information about our debt balances at March 31, 2010.

Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay quarterly interest at an average rate of 2.88% plus the three month LIBOR rate, and will receive payment at 5.625%. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. At March 31, 2011, the fair value of these derivatives was $15 million, of which $11 million is included in Other current assets and $4 million is included in Other noncurrent assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The carrying value of the 6.125% Notes was adjusted by an amount that is equal and offsetting to the fair value of the swaps. At March 31, 2011, $250 million of our Revolving Credit Facility due August 2012, was reclassified from long term debt to current debt and was repaid in April 2011. At March 31, 2011, our senior unsecured notes were rated Baa2 (stable) by Moodys Investor Services, BBB (positive) by Standard and Poors, and BBB+ (stable) by Fitch Ratings. At April 11, 2011 Standard and Poors upgraded our credit rating to BBB+ (stable), resulting in a decrease in the interest rate applicable to incremental borrowings from 0.66% to 0.58%. For further information on our debt balances, refer to Note 9, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock repurchases On May 12, 2010, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes us to acquire up to $500 million of our common stock. During fiscal 2011, we entered into brokerage arrangements with third party financial institutions to purchase our common stock in the open market on our behalf. We acquired 10.5 million shares of our common stock for $218 million under these arrangements during fiscal 2011. At March 31, 2011, we were authorized to purchase an aggregate amount of up to $282 million of additional shares of common stock under our current stock repurchase program. On May 12, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to acquire up to an additional $500 million of our common stock, in addition to the previous program approved on May 12, 2010. We will fund the program with available cash on hand and repurchase shares on the open market from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Dividends We have paid cash dividends each year since July 1990. For fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid annual cash dividends of $0.16 per share, which have been paid out in quarterly installments of $0.04 per share as and when declared by our Board of 38 Table of Contents Directors. Total cash dividends paid was $82 million, $83 million and $83 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On May 12, 2011, we announced an increase of the Companys regular quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share as and when declared by the Board of Directors. Effect of exchange rate changes There was an $89 million favorable effect to our cash balances in fiscal 2011 predominantly due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc of 5%, 10%, 13%, 5%, 14% and 15%, respectively. There was a $104 million favorable effect to our cash balances in fiscal 2010 predominantly due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar, Brazilian real and Canadian dollar of 32%, 29% and 24%, respectively. Off balance sheet arrangements Prior to fiscal 2001, we sold individual accounts receivable to a third party subject to certain recourse provisions. At March 31, 2011 none of these receivables were outstanding. The outstanding principal balance of these receivables subject to recourse approximated $21 million at March 31, 2010. Other than the commitments and recourse provisions described above, we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and, accordingly, off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited. Contractual obligations and commitments We have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with current accounting rules, the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at March 31, 2011 and the timing and effect that those commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. In addition, the table summarizes the timing of payments on our debt obligations as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2011. PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN 1 3 3 5 MORE THAN (IN MILLIONS) TOTAL 1 YEAR YEARS YEARS 5 YEARS Contractual Obligations Long term debt obligations (inclusive of interest) $ 1,962 $ 311 $ 129 $ 611 $ 911 Operating lease obligations(1) 529 101 152 105 171 Purchase obligations 108 44 30 33 1 Other obligations(2) 139 72 41 16 10 Total $ 2,738 $ 528 $ 352 $ 765 $ 1,093 (1) The contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases exclude sublease income totaling $30 million expected to be received in the following periods: $9 million (less than 1 year); $11 million (1 3 years); $4 million (3 5 years); and $6 million (more than 5 years). (2) Includes $26 million of estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions under the less than 1 year column for amounts that are estimated to be settled within one year of the balance sheet date. In addition, $542 million of estimated liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of when those amounts will become payable could not be made. Critical accounting policies and estimates We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well 39 Table of Contents as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. We consider the following significant accounting policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them. Revenue recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources: (1) licensing software products, including SaaS license agreements; (2) providing customer technical support (referred to as maintenance); and (3) providing professional services, such as product implementation, consulting and education. Software license agreements under our subscription model include the right to receive and use unspecified future software products for no additional fee during the term of the agreement. We are required under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to recognize revenue from these subscription licenses ratably over the term of the agreement. These amounts are recorded as subscription and maintenance revenue. We also license our software products without the right to unspecified future software products. Revenue from these arrangements is either recognized at the inception of the license agreement (upfront basis) or ratably over the term of any maintenance agreement that is bundled with the license. Revenue is recognized up front only when we have established VSOE for all of the undelivered elements of the agreement. We use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized up front. The residual method allocates arrangement consideration to the undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those elements, with the residual of the arrangement consideration allocated to the license. The portion allocated to the license is recognized up front once all four of the revenue recognition criteria are met. We establish VSOE of the fair value of maintenance from either contractually stated renewal rates or using the bell shaped curve method. VSOE of the fair value of professional services is established based on hourly rates when sold on a stand alone basis. Up front revenue is recorded as Software Fees and Other. Revenue recognized on an up front model will result in higher total revenue in a reporting period than if such revenue was recognized ratably. If VSOE does not exist for all undelivered elements of an arrangement, we recognize total revenue from the arrangement ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement. Revenue recognized ratably is recorded as Subscription and maintenance revenue. Revenue recognition does not commence until 1) we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer; 2) we deliver the specified products; 3) license agreement terms are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final; and 4) collection is probable. Revenue from sales to distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives commences, either on an up front basis or ratably as described above, when these entities sell the software product to their customers. This is commonly referred to as the sell through method. Revenue from professional service arrangements is generally recognized as the services are performed. Revenue and costs from committed professional services that are sold as part of a software license agreement are deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the life of the related software transaction. In the event that agreements with our customers are executed in close proximity of other license agreements with the same customer, we evaluate whether the separate arrangements are linked, and, if so, they are considered a single multi element arrangement for which revenue is recognized ratably as Subscription and maintenance revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under such agreements. We assess collectability based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed through the receipt of cash payment. We do not typically offer installment payments for perpetual license agreements that are recognized up front, within Software fees and other. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on our revenue recognition policy. 40 Table of Contents Accounts receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is a reserve for the impairment of accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts, we rely on several factors, including: Historical information, such as general collection history of multi year software agreements; Current customer information and events, such as extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy; Results of analyzing historical and current data; and The overall macroeconomic environment. The allowance includes two components: (1) specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when, based on current information, we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer; and (2) an allowance for losses inherent in the remaining receivable portfolio based on historical activity. Income taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, along with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates on income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. We utilize a more likely than not threshold for the recognition and derecognition of tax positions and measure positions accordingly. We reflect changes in recognition or measurement in a period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Goodwill, capitalized software products, and other intangible assets GAAP requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life. Absent any prior indicators of impairment, we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We have historically evaluated goodwill impairment based on a single reporting unit. We are in the process of reorganizing our internal management reporting and will change our segment reporting in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, which could give rise to changing how the Company tests for goodwill impairment. The goodwill impairment model is a two step process. The first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination; that is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test is measured using the quoted market price method. Determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. These estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management. This approach uses significant assumptions, including projected future cash flow, the discount rate 41 Table of Contents reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flow and a terminal growth rate. We performed our annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and concluded that no impairment charge was required. The carrying values of capitalized software products, for purchased software, internally developed software and other intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability on a quarterly basis. The facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the recoverability of the cost of other intangible assets from future cash flows to be derived from the use of the asset. It is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or, if such an impairment were to occur, the magnitude thereof. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are subject to amortization over the expected period of economic benefit to us. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives of intangible assets. In cases where a revision to the remaining amortization period is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. Accounting for business combinations The allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Product development and enhancements GAAP specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates. If other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility, the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been affected. Annual amortization of capitalized software costs is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product, generally estimated to be five years from the date the product became available for general release to customers. We amortize capitalized software costs using the straight line method. Accounting for share based compensation We currently maintain several stock based compensation plans. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain share based awards. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk free interest rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock based compensation expense could have been materially affected. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially affected in future years. As described in Note 15, Stock Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, performance share units (PSUs) are awards under the long term incentive programs for senior executives where the number of shares or restricted shares, as applicable, ultimately received by the senior executives depends on Company performance measured against specified targets and will be determined at the conclusion of the three year or one year period, as applicable. The fair value of each award is estimated on the date that the performance targets are established based on the fair value of our stock and our estimate of the level of achievement of our performance targets. We are required to recalculate the fair value of issued PSUs each reporting period until the underlying shares are granted. The adjustment is based on the quoted market price of our stock on the reporting period date. Each quarter, we compare the actual performance we expect to achieve with the performance targets. Fair value of financial instrument The measurement of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the authoritative guidance which establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. See Note 11, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information. 42 Table of Contents We are exposed to financial market risks arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Changes in interest rates could affect our monetary assets and liabilities, and foreign exchange rate changes could affect our foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions. We enter into derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating a portion of these risks. See Note 10, Derivatives, for additional information. All marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Premiums and discounts on debt securities recorded at the date of purchase are recognized in Interest expense, net using the effective interest method. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such investments are reported as Interest expense, net and are computed using the specific identification cost method. For marketable securities in an unrealized loss position, we are required to assess whether we intend to sell the security or will more likely than not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss. If either of these conditions is met, an other than temporary impairment on the security is recognized in Interest expense, net equal to the entire difference between its fair value and amortized cost basis. See Note 5, Marketable Securities, for additional information. Legal contingencies We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability of a loss and the determination as to whether the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, the decision to record an accrual and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims, and may revise our estimates. Any revisions could have a material effect on our results of operations. Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material legal proceedings. Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. Interest rate risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio, debt and installment accounts receivable. We have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in investments that are composed of money market funds, debt instruments of government agencies and investment grade corporate issuers (Standard and Poors single BBB+ rating and higher). To mitigate risk, the current weighted average duration is less than one year, and the holdings of any one non government issuer does not exceed 5% of the portfolio. At March 31, 2011, our outstanding debt was $1,551 million, all of which was in fixed rate obligations except for our 2008 Revolving Credit Facility which had a $250 million balance at March 31, 2011. Refer to Note 9, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. At March 31, 2011, we had interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $500 million, $200 million of which were entered into during fiscal year 2011, that swap a total of $500 million of our 6.125% Senior Notes due December 2014 into floating interest rate debt through December 1, 2014. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and are being accounted for in accordance with the shortcut method of FASB ASC Topic 815. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay quarterly interest at a rate at an average of 2.88%, plus the three month LIBOR rate, and will receive payment at 5.625%. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to date of the interest payment. At March 31, 2011, the fair value of these derivatives was approximately $15 million, of which approximately $11 million is included in Other current assets and approximately $4 million is included in Other noncurrent assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At March 31, 2010, the fair value of these derivatives was approximately $1 million and is included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have a corresponding effect on the annual interest expense related to our interest rates swaps that relate to the 6.125% Notes of approximately $1 million at March 31, 2011. 43 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2009, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $250 million to hedge a portion of our variable interest rate payments on the Revolving Credit Facility. These derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges and matured in October 2010. During fiscal 2011, under the terms of the interest rate swaps, we paid interest at an average annualized rate of 2.83% and received interest payment at the one month LIBOR rate. Foreign currency exchange risk We conduct business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in 47 countries and, as such, a portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing expected local currency revenues in relation to local currency costs and local currency assets in relation to local currency liabilities. In October 2005, our Board of Directors adopted our Risk Management Policy and Procedures, which authorize us to manage, based on managements assessment, our risks and exposures to foreign currency exchange rates through the use of derivative financial instruments (e.g., forward contracts, options and swaps) or other means. We only use derivative financial instruments in the context of hedging and do not use them for speculative purposes. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we did not designate our foreign exchange derivatives as hedges. Accordingly, all foreign exchange derivatives are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and unrealized or realized changes in fair value from these contracts are recorded as Other expenses (gains), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 10, Derivatives for additional information regarding our derivative activities. If foreign currency exchange rates affecting our business weakened by 10% on an overall basis in comparison to the U.S. dollar, the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would report in U.S. dollars would decrease by approximately $145 million.
