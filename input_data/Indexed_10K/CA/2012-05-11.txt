Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Introduction This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10 K and the Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10 K, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Business Overview We are the leading independent enterprise information technology (IT) management software and solutions company with expertise across IT environments from mainframe and physical to virtual and cloud. We develop and deliver software and services that help organizations accelerate, transform and secure their IT infrastructures to deliver flexible IT services. This allows customers to respond faster to business demands for new services, manage the quality of services, increase efficiency and reduce risk. We address components of the computing environment, including people, information, processes, systems, networks, applications and databases, across hardware and software platforms and programs. We offer a broad portfolio of software solutions that address customer needs to accelerate, transform and secure IT environments, including mainframe; service assurance; security (identity and access management); service and portfolio management; and virtualization and service automation. We deliver our products on premises or, for certain products, using Software as a Service (SaaS). We license our products worldwide. We serve companies across most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers, government agencies, telecommunication providers, manufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational organizations and health care institutions. These customers typically maintain IT infrastructures that are both complex and central to their objectives for operational excellence. We are the leading independent software vendor in the mainframe space, and we continue to innovate on the mainframe platform, which runs many of our largest customers most important applications. As the IT landscape continues to evolve, more companies are seeking to improve the efficiency, mobility and availability of their IT resources and applications by adopting next generation technologies like virtualization and cloud computing and consuming IT as SaaS. While these technologies can reduce operating costs tied to physical infrastructure, this evolution in computing is also making IT environments more complex. Data centers are evolving to include mainframes, physical servers, virtualized servers and private, public and hybrid (a combination of public and private) cloud environments. We believe it is vital for companies to effectively accelerate, transform and secure all of their various computing environments, while being able to deliver new services quickly based on business needs. Our core strengths in IT management and security, combined with our investments in innovative technologies, position us to serve a range of customers which we have divided into three customer segments: (1) approximately 1,000 core customers with annual revenue in excess of $2 billion (Large Existing Enterprises), which currently account for approximately 80% of our revenue; (2) enterprises with revenue in excess of $2 billion that have not historically been significant customers of ours (Large New Enterprises), a customer segment which we believe includes 4,500 potential new customers but where we intend to initially focus on approximately 1,000 of these customers selected based on our 20 Table of Contents current geographical and vertical strengths; and (3) approximately 7,000 enterprises with revenue between $300 million and $2 billion and in fast growing geographies like Latin America and Asia (Growth Markets). We believe by targeting these customer segments, we are more than doubling our total addressable market. To enable us to execute on our business strategy more effectively, we: Began rebalancing our sales force to add 300 new quota carrying sales representatives, of which one third are new to the Company. Both the new and reallocated representatives will be dedicated to and compensated for selling new products to customers. Aligned our business, including both internal business units and some operational functions, to more closely align with our products to reflect both the evolving markets and our new target customers. Held our user conference in November 2011, CA World, which brought together IT professionals from around the world to exchange IT management strategies. During the conference, we announced key initiatives centered on our theme of IT at the Speed of Business, which support customers as they transition from simply managing IT to delivering business services. Acquired privately held Interactive TKO, Inc. (ITKO), a leading provider of service simulation solutions for developing applications in composite and cloud environments. Acquired Base Technologies, a privately held consulting firm focused on the management of IT assets, with leading practices in virtualization management, mainframe technology, security and managed IT infrastructure. Sold our non strategic Internet Security business. Organized our offerings into our Mainframe Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Services operating segments. This new reporting disaggregates our operations into two software segments and one services segment. In January 2012, our Board of Directors approved a capital allocation program that targets the return of up to $2.5 billion to shareholders through fiscal 2014. This includes an increase in the annual dividend from $0.20 to $1.00 per share on our common stock as and when declared by the Board of Directors and the authorization to acquire up to $1.5 billion of our common stock. CA Technologies Business Model We generate revenue from the following sources: license fees licensing our products on a right to use basis; maintenance fees providing customer technical support and product enhancements; and service fees providing professional services such as product implementation, consulting and education. The timing and amount of fees recognized as revenue during a reporting period are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Revenue is reported net of applicable sales taxes. Under our business model, we offer customers a wide range of licensing options. For traditional, on premises licensing, we typically license to customers either perpetually or on a subscription basis for a specified term. Our customers also purchase maintenance and support services that provide technical support and any product enhancements released during the maintenance period. Under a perpetual license, the customer has the right to use the licensed program for an indefinite period of time upon payment of a one time license fee. If the customer wants to receive maintenance, the customer is required to pay an additional annual maintenance fee. Under a subscription license, the customer has the right to usage and maintenance of the licensed products during the term of the agreement. Under our flexible licensing terms, customers can license our software products under multi year licenses, with most customers choosing terms of one to five years, although longer terms may sometimes be negotiated by customers in order to obtain greater cost certainty. Thereafter, the license generally renews for the same period of time on the same terms and conditions, but subject to the customers payment of our then prevailing subscription license fee. For our mainframe solutions, the majority of our licenses provide customers with the right to use one or more of our products up to a specific license capacity, generally measured in millions of instructions per second (MIPS). For these products, customers may acquire additional capacity during the term of a license by paying us an additional license fee. For our enterprise solutions, our licenses may provide customers with the right to use one or more of our products limited to a number of servers, users or gigabytes, among other things. Customers may license these products for additional servers, users or gigabytes, etc., during the term of a license by paying us an additional license fee. 21 Table of Contents SaaS is another delivery model we offer to our customers who prefer to utilize our technology off premises with little to no infrastructure required. Our SaaS offerings are typically licensed using a subscription fee, most commonly on a monthly or annual basis. Our services are typically delivered on a time and materials basis, but alternative pay arrangements, such as fixed fee or staff augmentations, can also be arranged. Executive Summary The following is a summary of the analysis of our results contained in our MD&A. Total revenue for fiscal 2012 increased 9% to $4,814 million compared with $4,429 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in subscription and maintenance revenue, an increase in software fees and other revenue and to a lesser extent an increase in professional services revenue. The increase in subscription and maintenance revenue for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to revenue associated with a five year license agreement with a large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million that was executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2012, total revenue reflected a favorable foreign exchange effect of $89 million compared with fiscal 2011. Revenue increased 7% from existing products and services and 2% from acquired businesses (which we define as businesses acquired within the prior 12 months). The growth in revenue from existing products and services was positively affected by the aforementioned license agreement with a large IT outsourcer, the favorable effect of foreign exchange and increases in software fees and other revenue. Excluding the foreign exchange effect, revenue increased 5% from existing products and services and 2% from acquired businesses. Total bookings for fiscal 2012 decreased 5% to $4,663 million compared with $4,888 million in fiscal 2011. Bookings for fiscal 2011 include a license agreement with a large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The decrease in bookings attributable to the effect of this large contract being booked in fiscal 2011 was partially offset by an increase in fiscal 2012 bookings that are recognized as software fees and other revenue and an increase in professional services bookings (primarily attributable to an increase in professional service engagements and to a lesser extent our fiscal 2012 acquisition of Base Technologies). Our total new product and capacity sales for fiscal 2012 increased by a low single digit percentage from fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily a result of new product sales within the Mainframe Solutions segment, partially offset by a decrease in new product sales within the Enterprise Solutions segment. Capacity sales for fiscal 2012 were consistent with fiscal 2011. Renewal bookings for fiscal 2012, which generally do not include new product and capacity sales and professional services arrangements, were slightly better than the 15% year over year decline we previously expected. This decline was primarily due to the aforementioned license agreement with the large IT outsourcer executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. In addition, weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years was consistent with fiscal 2011. We currently expect our fiscal 2013 renewal portfolio to decline in the single digits compared with fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2012, our renewal yield was slightly below 90%. Total expense before interest and income taxes of $3,425 million for fiscal 2012 grew 8%, compared with $3,175 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with our recent acquisitions, an increase in personnel related costs for selling and marketing and an increase in expenses for product development and enhancements. Income before interest and income taxes increased $135 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011, which reflects the higher growth rate in revenue compared with expenses. Tax expense increased $30 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011, primarily as a result of an increase in income before taxes in fiscal 2012, partially offset by the recognition of tax benefits related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary and a decrease in the valuation allowance from the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards due to a change in forecasted state taxable income. Diluted income per common share from continuing operations for fiscal 2012 was $1.90, compared with $1.60 in fiscal 2011, primarily reflecting an increase in operating income, our repurchases of common shares and a decrease in our fiscal 2012 tax rate. For fiscal 2012, our segment performance results were as follows: Mainframe Solutions revenue increased $133 million, or 5%, from fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to a license agreement with a large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a $39 million license fee received as final payment pursuant to a litigation settlement with Rocket Software, Inc. (Final License Payment) and revenue recognized from new mainframe capacity sales that were primarily sold in the second half of fiscal 2011. Mainframe Solutions operating margin for fiscal 2012 was 56% compared with 54% for fiscal 2011. The increase in operating margin for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the increase in revenue. 22 Table of Contents Enterprise Solutions revenue increased $197 million, or 12%, from fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to growth in revenue from our security (identity and access management), virtualization and service automation and project and portfolio management products. The increase in revenue was partially offset by the increase in development investment and selling and marketing expenses. Operating margins were consistent with fiscal 2011. Services revenue and expenses increased from fiscal 2011 as a result of our fiscal 2012 acquisition of Base Technologies. For fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011, Services operating margin remained consistent. Total revenue backlog decreased 3% to $8,473 million compared with $8,760 million from fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to an unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, the decrease in year over year bookings associated with the aforementioned license agreement with a large IT outsourcer signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and the increase in bookings recognized as software fees and other revenue (which would not be reflected in the total revenue backlog at fiscal year end). Current revenue backlog was unfavorably affected by foreign exchange. Excluding this effect, total current revenue backlog would have increased 1%. Generally, we believe that an increase in the current portion of revenue backlog on a year over year basis is a positive indicator of future subscription and maintenance revenue growth. For fiscal 2012, cash provided by operating activities continuing operations increased 9% to $1,505 million compared with $1,377 million in fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash collections from billings of $368 million, offset by an increase in income tax payments of $198 million and an increase in vendor, payroll and other disbursements of $42 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we sold our Internet Security business and during the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we sold our Information Governance business. The results of these business operations are presented as discontinued operations. Performance Indicators Management uses several quantitative and qualitative performance indicators to assess our financial results and condition. Each provides a measurement of the performance of our business and how well we are executing our plan. Our predominantly subscription based business model is less common among our competitors in the software industry and it may be difficult to compare the results for many of our performance indicators with those of our competitors. The following is a summary of the principal performance indicators that management uses to review performance: YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, CHANGE PERCENTCHANGE 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Total revenue $ 4,814 $ 4,429 $ 385 9 % Income from continuing operations $ 938 $ 823 $ 115 14 % Cash provided by operating activities continuing operations $ 1,505 $ 1,377 $ 128 9 % Total bookings $ 4,663 $ 4,888 $ (225 ) (5 )% Subscription and maintenance bookings $ 3,776 $ 4,256 $ (480 ) (11 )% Weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years 3.46 3.46 % AT MARCH 31, CHANGE PERCENTCHANGE 2012 2011 (dollars in millions) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities(1) $ 2,679 $ 3,228 $ (549 ) (17 )% Total debt $ 1,301 $ 1,551 $ (250 ) (16 )% Total expected future cash collections from committed contracts(2) $ 5,745 $ 6,043 $ (298 ) (5 )% Total revenue backlog(2) $ 8,473 $ 8,760 $ (287 ) (3 )% Total current revenue backlog(2) $ 3,714 $ 3,724 $ (10 ) % (1) At March 31, 2012, marketable securities were less than $1 million.

(2) Refer to the discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A for additional information about expected future cash collections from committed contracts, billing backlog and revenue backlog. Analyses of our performance indicators, including general trends, can be found in the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MD&A. Total Revenue Total revenue is the amount of revenue recognized during the reporting period from the sale of license, maintenance and professional services agreements. Amounts recognized as subscription and maintenance revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Professional services revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed or 23 Table of Contents recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the related software license. Software fees and other revenue generally represents license fee revenue recognized at the inception of a license agreement (up front basis) and also includes our SaaS revenue, which is recognized as services are provided. Total Bookings Total bookings or sales includes the incremental value of all subscription, maintenance and professional services contracts and software fees and other contracts entered into during the reporting period and is generally reflective of the amount of products and services during the period that our customers have agreed to purchase from us. Revenue for bookings attributed to sales of software products for which license fee revenue is recognized on an up front basis is reflected in Software fees and other in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As our business strategy has evolved, our management looks within bookings at total new product and capacity sales, which we define as sales of products or mainframe capacity that are new or in addition to products or mainframe capacity previously contracted for by a customer. The amount of new product and capacity sales for a period, as currently tracked by us, requires estimation by management and has not been historically reported. Within a given period, the amount of new product and capacity sales may not be material to the change in our total bookings or revenue compared with prior periods. New product and capacity sales can be reflected as subscription and maintenance bookings in the period (for which revenue would be recognized ratably over the term of the contract) or in software fees and other bookings (which are recognized as software fees and other revenue in the current period). Subscription and Maintenance Bookings Subscription and maintenance bookings is the aggregate incremental amount we expect to collect from our customers over the terms of the underlying subscription and maintenance agreements entered into during a reporting period. These amounts include the sale of products directly by us and may include additional products, services or other fees for which we have not established vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE). Subscription and maintenance bookings also includes indirect sales by distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives to end users, where the contracts incorporate the right for end users to receive unspecified future software products, and other contracts without these rights entered into in close proximity or contemplation of such agreements. These amounts are expected to be recognized ratably as subscription and maintenance revenue over the applicable term of the agreements. Subscription and maintenance bookings exclude the value associated with certain perpetual licenses, license only indirect sales, SaaS offerings and professional services arrangements. The license and maintenance agreements that contribute to subscription and maintenance bookings represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods that range generally from three to five years, although in certain cases customer commitments can be for longer or shorter periods. These current period bookings are often renewals of prior contracts that also had various durations, usually from three to five years. The amount of new subscription and maintenance bookings recorded in a period is affected by the volume, duration and value of contracts renewed during that period. Subscription and maintenance bookings typically increases in each consecutive quarter during a fiscal year, with the first quarter having the least bookings and the fourth quarter having the most bookings. However, subscription and maintenance bookings may not always follow the pattern of increasing in consecutive quarters during a fiscal year, and the quarter to quarter differences in subscription and maintenance bookings may vary. Given the varying durations of the contracts being renewed, year over year comparisons of bookings are not always indicative of the overall bookings trend. Generally, we believe that an increase in the current portion of revenue backlog on a year over year basis is a positive indicator of future subscription and maintenance revenue growth due to the high percentage of our revenue that is recognized from license agreements that are already committed and being recognized ratably. Within bookings, we also consider the yield on our renewal portfolio. We define renewal yield as the percentage of the renewable portion of the prior contract (e.g., the maintenance value) realized in current period bookings. The baseline for calculating renewal yield is an estimate affected by various factors including contractual renewal terms, price increases and other conditions. We estimate the yield based on a review of material transactions representing a substantial majority of the dollar value of renewals during the current period. Year over year changes in renewal yield may not be materially correlated to year over year changes in bookings. Additionally, period to period changes in subscription and maintenance bookings do not necessarily correlate to changes in cash receipts. The contribution to current period revenue from subscription and maintenance bookings from any single license or maintenance agreement is relatively small, since revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable term for these agreements. Weighted Average Subscription and Maintenance License Agreement Duration in Years The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years reflects the duration of all subscription and maintenance agreements executed during a period, weighted by the total contract value of each individual agreement. Weighted average subscription and maintenance license 24 Table of Contents agreement duration in years can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of license agreements entered into during a period. Weighted average duration information is disclosed in order to provide additional understanding of the volume of our bookings. Total Revenue Backlog Total revenue backlog represents the aggregate amount we expect to recognize as revenue in the future as either subscription and maintenance revenue, professional services revenue or software fees and other revenue associated with contractually committed amounts billed or to be billed as of the balance sheet date. Total revenue backlog is composed of amounts recognized as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as deferred revenue (billed or collected) as well as unearned amounts yet to be billed under subscription and maintenance and software fees and other agreements. Classification of amounts as current and noncurrent depends on when such amounts are expected to be earned and therefore recognized as revenue. Amounts that are expected to be earned and therefore recognized as revenue in 12 months or less are classified as current, while amounts expected to be earned in greater than 12 months are classified as noncurrent. The portion of the total revenue backlog that relates to subscription and maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the duration of the underlying agreements and is reported as subscription and maintenance revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Generally, we believe that an increase in the current portion of revenue backlog on a year over year basis is a positive indicator of future subscription and maintenance revenue growth. Deferred revenue (billed or collected) is composed of: (i) amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition, (ii) amounts billed but not collected for which revenue has not yet been earned, and (iii) amounts received in advance of revenue recognition from financial institutions where we have transferred our interest in committed installments (referred to as Financing obligations and other in Note 8, Deferred Revenue in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Results of Operations The following table presents revenue and expense line items reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 and the period over period dollar and percentage changes for those line items.

Revenue As more fully described below, total revenue increased in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 and in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2012, total revenue reflected a favorable foreign exchange effect of $89 million compared with fiscal 2011. The foreign exchange effect for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was not material. Subscription and Maintenance Revenue Subscription and maintenance revenue is the amount of revenue recognized ratably during the reporting period from: (i) subscription license agreements that were in effect during the period, generally including maintenance that is bundled with and not separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, (ii) maintenance agreements associated with providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and upgrades that are separately identifiable from software usage fees or product sales, and (iii) license agreements bundled with additional products, maintenance or professional services for which VSOE has not been established. These amounts include the sale of products directly by us, as well as by distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives to end users, where the contracts incorporate the right for end users to receive unspecified future software products, and other contracts entered into in close proximity or contemplation of such agreements. The increase in subscription and maintenance revenue for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to revenue associated with a five year license agreement with a large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million that was executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. In addition, for fiscal 2012, there was a favorable foreign exchange effect of $79 million compared with fiscal 2011. The increase in subscription and maintenance revenue for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to revenue associated with our fiscal 2010 acquisitions of NetQoS, Inc. and Nimsoft AS (both of which occurred during the second half of fiscal 2010). For fiscal 2011, revenue reflected a favorable foreign exchange effect of less than $1 million. Professional Services Professional services revenue primarily includes product implementation, consulting, customer training and customer education. Professional services revenue increased in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to our fiscal 2012 acquisition of Base Technologies. 26 Table of Contents The professional services revenue increase in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the increased number of engagements under service contracts. Software Fees and Other Software fees and other revenue primarily consists of revenue that is recognized on an up front basis. This includes revenue associated with enterprise solutions products sold on an up front basis directly by our sales force or through transactions with distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives (sometimes referred to as our indirect or channel revenue). It also includes our SaaS revenue, which is recognized as the services are provided rather than up front. In fiscal 2012, there was a year over year increase in sales associated with our perpetual enterprise solutions products of $65 million, of which $31 million was for products that were newly eligible for up front revenue recognition in the second half of fiscal 2012 and $13 million was associated with our acquisition of ITKO. In addition, there was an increase of $34 million in revenue from our SaaS offerings. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we recognized $39 million in revenue under a license agreement we entered into in connection with a litigation settlement with Rocket Software, Inc. (Rocket) during fiscal 2009 that resolved our claims against Rocket for copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation. Rocket did not admit any wrongdoing in connection with this settlement. As part of this settlement, Rocket agreed to license technology from us, including source code authored several years ago and related trade secrets that were the subject of the litigation. The amount received during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 reflects the final amount owed to us, which was not scheduled to be paid in full until fiscal 2014 (Final License Payment). Rocket paid this amount in advance at their discretion, unsolicited by us and without any discount or concession by us. Software fees and other revenue increased for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to $48 million in revenue from service assurance technologies associated with the NetQoS acquisition (which occurred during the second half of fiscal 2010) that were successfully integrated into our existing product portfolio, $36 million from existing application management products sold on an up front basis and $27 million from our SaaS offerings from a recent acquisition and other organic technologies sold as SaaS. Total Revenue by Geography The following table presents the amount of revenue earned from sales to unaffiliated customers in the United States and international regions and corresponding percentage changes for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010.

International revenue increased by $92 million, or 5%, for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to a favorable foreign exchange effect of $89 million. Excluding the favorable foreign exchange effect, international revenue would have increased by $3 million primarily as a result of revenue growth in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region, which was offset by lower revenue in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Revenue in the United States increased by $182 million, or 8% for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to higher software fees and other revenue. International revenue increased by $20 million, or 1% for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. Lower revenue in Europe, Middle East and Africa was offset by revenue growth in Latin America and the Asia Pacific Japan region. Excluding a favorable foreign exchange effect of $4 million, International revenue would have increased by $16 million, or 1%. Price changes do not have a material effect on revenue in a given period as a result of our ratable subscription model. Expenses The overall increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due an increase in costs associated with our recent acquisitions, an increase in personnel related costs for selling and marketing and an increase in expenses for product development and enhancements. 27 Table of Contents The overall increase in operating expenses for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to costs associated with our fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions and an increase in selling and marketing costs attributable to CA World, our user conference, partially offset by the decrease in general and administrative costs. In fiscal 2010, we incurred restructuring costs of $50 million associated with our fiscal 2010 restructuring plan, which did not reoccur in fiscal 2011. Costs of Licensing and Maintenance Costs of licensing and maintenance include technical support, royalties and distribution costs. The increase in costs of licensing and maintenance for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was due to an increase in costs associated with our recent acquisitions. The increase in costs of licensing and maintenance for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in cost of goods sold expense of $21 million from the acquired technologies related to the NetQoS acquisition. Cost of Professional Services Cost of professional services consists primarily of our personnel related costs associated with providing professional services and training to customers. For fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011, cost of professional services increased primarily as a result of our fiscal 2012 acquisition of Base Technologies. Gross margins on professional services were approximately 7% for each of fiscal 2012 and 2011. For fiscal 2011, cost of professional services increased compared with fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in services projects, as reflected by the $39 million increase in revenue. These costs increased at a higher rate than revenue primarily as a result of a higher mix of engagements that required additional effort to meet customer requirements during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. These engagements resulted in lower margins and as a result gross margins on professional services decreased to 7% for fiscal 2011, compared with 9% for fiscal 2010. Amortization of Capitalized Software Costs Amortization of capitalized software costs consists of the amortization of both purchased software and internally generated capitalized software development costs. Internally generated capitalized software development costs relate to new products and significant enhancements to existing software products that have reached the technological feasibility stage. For fiscal 2012, amortization of capitalized software costs increased compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to the increase in projects that reached general availability in recent periods and amortization associated with technology acquired from our recent acquisitions. For fiscal 2011, amortization of capitalized software costs increased compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to the increase in amortization expense associated with assets acquired from our fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 acquisitions and the increase in projects that reached general availability in recent periods. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expenses include the costs relating to our sales force, channel partners, corporate and business marketing and sales training programs. The increase in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of $114 million, which includes $16 million of costs associated with our recent acquisitions and an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of $13 million compared with fiscal 2011. The increase in personnel related costs also includes severance costs of $22 million associated with our fiscal 2012 workforce reduction plan (Fiscal 2012 Plan). In addition, commission expenses increased $12 million for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. These increases were partially offset by a $28 million decrease in promotional and travel costs for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. The increase in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in personnel related costs of $46 million, of which $22 million primarily related to costs associated with our fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions. Promotional and travel costs increased by $39 million, primarily due to $20 million of costs associated with CA World, our user conference, and our re branding initiative. CA World occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and is our largest periodic promotional and marketing event that takes place approximately every 18 months. Included in the promotional and travel cost increase is $10 million of additional expenses that were associated with our fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 acquisitions. A portion of the increase in personnel and promotion costs is associated with our continued investment in Growth Markets and emerging geographies. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate and support functions, including our executive leadership and administration groups, finance, legal, human resources, corporate communications and other costs such as provisions for doubtful accounts. 28 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 increased $11 million, primarily due to $14 million of costs associated with our recent acquisitions and $9 million of severance costs in connection with the actions under our Fiscal 2012 Plan. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in external consulting and personnel related costs. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily related to a decrease in personnel related and office costs of $29 million and consulting costs of $15 million. The decrease in personnel related expense was primarily due to lower financial performance attainment levels under our equity and cash compensation plans for fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, we incurred costs related to the departure of our Chief Executive Officer and the transition to his successor. These decreases were offset by increases in personnel costs of $20 million associated with our fiscal 2011 and 2010 acquisitions. Product Development and Enhancements For each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, product development and enhancements expenses represented approximately 11% of total revenue. The increase in product development and enhancements expenses for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to additional costs incurred to broaden our enterprise solutions product offerings and $8 million of severance costs in connection with the actions under our Fiscal 2012 Plan. For fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, product development and enhancements expenses represented approximately 11% and 12% of total revenue, respectively. The decrease in product development and enhancements was primarily due to the costs incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 associated with our fiscal 2010 restructuring plan. This was partially offset by the additional costs incurred during fiscal 2011 in connection with our investment in technologies to support our growth strategy, as well as a broadening of our enterprise solutions product offerings. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Intangible Assets The decrease in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to decreased amortization costs of intangible assets relating to prior period acquisitions. The increase in depreciation and amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses for acquired assets and fixed assets placed into service during fiscal 2011. Other Expenses, Net Other expenses, net includes gains and losses attributable to divested assets, foreign currency, exchange rate changes, impairment charges and other miscellaneous items. YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, (in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Losses (gains) attributable to divesture of assets $ 2 $ (11 ) $ (1 ) Foreign currency losses, net 4 18 10 Expense attributable to litigation claims and settlements 9 5 Other losses, net 4 Total $ 15 $ 7 $ 18 For fiscal 2012, other expenses, net included $7 million of losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by $3 million of gains relating to our foreign exchange derivative contracts, which we use to mitigate our operating risks and exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, for fiscal 2012, other expenses, net included $9 million of expenses in connection with litigation claims. For fiscal 2011, other expenses, net included $14 million of losses relating to our foreign exchange derivative contracts, which were used to mitigate our operating risks and exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. These losses were offset by foreign currency transaction gains due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of other countries in which we conduct our operations. During fiscal 2011, we received $10 million in settlements of claims associated with previous stockholder derivative actions following the substitution of us as plaintiff in those actions. These settlements were offset by expenses in connection with other litigation claims. In addition, during fiscal 2011 we recorded a $10 million gain from the sale of our interest in an investment. In fiscal 2010, other expense, net included net foreign exchange losses of $10 million. The foreign exchange amounts recorded in fiscal 2010 included net losses of $20 million associated with derivative contracts. These losses were offset by foreign currency transaction gains due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of other countries in which we conduct our operations. In addition, for fiscal 2010, other expenses, net included an impairment charge of $3 million for internally developed software. 29 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net The decrease in interest expense, net for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense resulting from our overall decrease in debt. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we repaid $250 million of our revolving credit facility, which was due August 2012. The decrease in interest expense, net for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense resulting from our overall decrease in debt. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we reduced our debt outstanding and increased our weighted average maturity, enhancing our capital structure and financial flexibility. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this MD&A and Note 9, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 31%, 32% and 34%, for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, resulted primarily from the recognition of tax benefits related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary and a decrease in the valuation allowance from the recognition of state net operating loss carryforwards due to a change in forecasted state taxable income. These items taken together resulted in a net benefit of $36 million for fiscal 2012 as we continue our efforts to improve our long term tax profile. The reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010, resulted primarily from affirmative claims in the context of tax audits, resolutions of uncertain tax positions relating to non U.S. jurisdictions and the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Development Tax Credit in December 2010, partially offset by refinements of tax positions taken in prior periods. These items taken together resulted in a net benefit of $33 million for fiscal 2011. The reduction in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, resulted primarily from the net charge incurred in fiscal 2009 that did not reoccur in fiscal 2010, in addition to fiscal 2010 reconciliations of tax returns to tax provisions, resolutions of uncertain tax positions relating to non U.S. jurisdictions and refinements of estimates ascribed to tax positions taken in prior periods relating to our international tax profile. These items taken together resulted in a net benefit of $10 million for fiscal 2010. No provision has been made for U.S. federal income taxes on $1,999 million and $1,719 million at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we plan to permanently reinvest all such earnings outside the United States. It is not practicable to determine the amount of tax associated with such unremitted earnings. In April 2011, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007 and issued a report of its findings in connection with the examination. We disagree with certain proposed adjustments in the report and are vigorously disputing these matters through the IRS appellate process. While we believe that the recorded reserves are sufficient to cover exposures related to these issues, such that the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations, the resolution of this matter involves uncertainties and the ultimate resolution could differ from the amounts recorded. The IRS is also examining our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008, 2009 and 2010. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we sold our Internet Security business for $14 million. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we sold our Information Governance business, consisting primarily of the CA Records Manager and CA Message Manager software offerings and related professional services, for $19 million. The results of discontinued operations for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 included revenue of $15 million, $83 million and $126 million, respectively, and income from operations, net of taxes, of $13 million, $4 million and $12 million, respectively. Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Performance of Segments In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we changed the internal reporting used by our Chief Executive Officer for evaluating segment performance and allocating resources. The new reporting disaggregates our operations into Mainframe Solutions, Enterprise Solutions and Services segments. 30 Table of Contents Our Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions operating segments comprise our software business organized by the nature of our software offerings and the product hierarchy in which the platform operates. Our mainframe solutions, including Mainframe 2.0, help customers and partners simplify mainframe management, gain more value from existing technology and extend mainframe capabilities. Our enterprise solutions consists of various product offerings, including service assurance, security (identity and access management), service and portfolio management and virtualization and service automation, SaaS, and cloud offerings. These offerings are providing us with additional access to Growth Markets, which we define as companies with annual revenue between $300 million and $2 billion. Our Services segment comprises implementation, consulting, education and training services, including those directly related to the mainframe solutions and enterprise solutions software that we sell to our customers. We regularly enter into a single arrangement with a customer that includes mainframe solutions, enterprise solutions and services. The amount of contract revenue assigned to segments is generally based on the manner in which the proposal is made to the customer. The software product revenue is assigned to the Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments based on either: (1) a list price allocation method (which allocates a discount in the total contract price to the individual products in proportion to the list price of the product); (2) allocations included within internal contract approval documents; or (3) the value for individual software products as stated in the customer contract. The price for the implementation, consulting, education and training services is separately stated in the contract and these amounts of contract revenue are assigned to the Services segment. The contract value assigned to each segment is then recognized in a manner consistent with the revenue recognition policies we apply to the customer contract for purposes of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment expenses include costs that are controllable by segment managers (i.e., direct costs) and, in the case of the Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments, an allocation of shared and indirect costs (i.e., allocated costs). Segment specific direct costs include a portion of selling and marketing costs, licensing and maintenance costs, product development costs, general and administrative costs and amortization of the cost of internally developed software. Allocated segment costs primarily include indirect selling and marketing costs and general and administrative costs that are not directly attributable to a specific segment. The basis for allocating shared and indirect costs between the Mainframe Solutions and Enterprise Solutions segments is dependent on the nature of the cost being allocated and is either in proportion to segment revenues or in proportion to the related direct cost category. Expenses for the Services segment consist only of direct costs and there are no allocated or indirect costs for the Services segment. Segment expenses do not include the following: share based compensation expense; amortization of purchased software; amortization of other intangible assets; derivative hedging gains and losses; and severance, exit costs and related charges associated with the fiscal 2007 restructuring plan. Segment financial information for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows: MAINFRAME SOLUTIONS FISCAL 2012 FISCAL 2011 FISCAL 2010 Revenue $ 2,612 $ 2,479 $ 2,515 Expenses 1,140 1,129 1,162 Segment profit $ 1,472 $ 1,350 $ 1,353 Segment operating margin 56 % 54 % 54 % For fiscal 2012, Mainframe Solutions revenue increased $133 million from fiscal 2011. The year over year increase in Mainframe Solutions revenue for fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to $55 million from the five year license agreement with a large IT outsourcer executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, a favorable foreign exchange effect of $53 million and $39 million from the aforementioned Final License Payment. Mainframe Solutions operating margin for fiscal 2012 was 56% compared with 54% for fiscal 2011. The increase in operating margin for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the increase in revenue, partially offset by a $22 million severance charge relating to our Fiscal 2012 Plan. For fiscal 2011, Mainframe Solutions revenue and operating margin were not materially different compared with fiscal 2010. ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS FISCAL 2012 FISCAL 2011 FISCAL 2010 Revenue $ 1,820 $ 1,623 $ 1,424 Expenses 1,668 1,501 1,350 Segment profit $ 152 $ 122 $ 74 Segment operating margin 8 % 8 % 5 % For fiscal 2012, Enterprise Solutions revenue increased $197 million from fiscal 2011 primarily due to growth in revenue from our security (identity and access management), virtualization and service automation and service and portfolio management 31 Table of Contents products. Revenue from these products is recognized in either subscription and maintenance revenue or software fees and other revenue. Enterprise Solutions revenue was also positively affected by $25 million from the five year license agreement with a large IT outsourcer executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2012, Enterprise Solutions revenue reflected a favorable foreign exchange effect of $29 million compared with fiscal 2011. Enterprise Solutions operating margin for each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was 8%. Operating margin was affected by an increase in revenue for fiscal 2012, offset by the increased development investment and selling and marketing expenses within our Enterprise Solutions segment, as well as a severance charge of $19 million relating to our Fiscal 2012 Plan. For fiscal 2011, Enterprise Solutions revenue increased $199 million from fiscal 2010. The year over year increase in Enterprise Solutions revenue was primarily due to growth within our service assurance, service and portfolio management and security (identity and access management) products. The increase in Enterprise Solutions operating margin from 5% in fiscal 2010 to 8% in fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue for fiscal 2011, partially offset by increased selling and marketing and costs of licensing and maintenance expenses within our Enterprise Solutions segment. SERVICES FISCAL 2012 FISCAL 2011 FISCAL 2010 Revenue $ 382 $ 327 $ 288 Expenses 359 310 280 Segment profit $ 23 $ 17 $ 8 Segment operating margin 6 % 5 % 3 % Service segment expenses include cost of professional services and assigned general and administrative expenses that are not included in the cost of professional services expense lines of the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For fiscal 2012, Services revenue and expenses compared with fiscal 2011 increased primarily as a result of our fiscal 2012 acquisition of Base Technologies. For fiscal 2012, Services revenue reflected a favorable foreign exchange effect of $7 million compared with fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011, Services operating margin remained consistent. For fiscal 2011, Services revenue and expenses compared with fiscal 2010 increased primarily due to an increase in services projects during the period. As a result of the increase in revenue and a decrease in general and administrative expenses related to services headquarters functions, gross margins on professional services increased to 5% for fiscal 2011 compared with 3% for fiscal 2010. Refer to Note 18, Segment and Geographic Information, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Bookings For fiscal 2012, total bookings decreased $225 million from $4,888 million in fiscal 2011 to $4,663 million in fiscal 2012, primarily as a result of a license renewal agreement with a large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million, which was executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and is included in subscription and maintenance bookings. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in bookings that are recognized as software fees and other revenue. In addition, there was an increase in professional services bookings primarily attributable to an increase in the number of professional services engagements entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and to a lesser extent our fiscal 2012 acquisition of Base Technologies. For fiscal 2012, total bookings from new product and capacity sales increased by a low single digit percentage from fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily a result of new product sales within the Mainframe Solutions segment, which includes the aforementioned Final License Payment. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in Enterprise Solutions segment new product sales. Capacity sales for fiscal 2012 were consistent with fiscal 2011. Bookings in the United States for fiscal 2012 decreased from fiscal 2011, primarily due to the aforementioned fiscal 2011 license agreement with a large IT outsourcer executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This decrease was partially offset by the increase in professional services bookings and the new product sales within the Mainframe Solutions segment. Total international bookings for fiscal 2012 increased from fiscal 2011. Bookings in Latin America for fiscal 2012 increased primarily as a result of an increase in renewals and an increase in new product and capacity sales in fiscal 2012. Bookings in Asia Pacific Japan region for fiscal 2012 increased from fiscal 2011 primarily due to an increase in renewals and new product and capacity sales. Total bookings in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region increased slightly for fiscal 2012, primarily due to a large multi year contract with a financial institution in Europe executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, total bookings were $4,888 million and $4,843 million, respectively. Total fiscal 2011 bookings included the license agreement with a large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million. The increase in bookings reflected favorable results for new product sales in connection with software fees and other bookings (recognized as software fees and other 32 Table of Contents revenue in the current period), which was partially offset by a decrease in subscription and maintenance bookings for fiscal 2011. Total new product sales and mainframe capacity grew in the low single digits for the fiscal year. Within new product and capacity sales in fiscal 2011, the increase in new distributed products was partially offset by a decrease in mainframe capacity and new mainframe product sales. Bookings in Europe, Middle East and Africa declined due to the lower number of scheduled renewals and new product sales during fiscal 2011. This decline was mostly offset by growth in the United States. Subscription and Maintenance Bookings For fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, subscription and maintenance bookings were $3,776 million and $4,256 million, respectively. Subscription and maintenance bookings for fiscal 2011, includes a five year license renewal agreement with a large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million, which was executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, we renewed a total of 57 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $1,722 million. During fiscal 2011, we renewed a total of 56 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $1,994 million. Generally, quarters with smaller renewal inventories result in a lower level of bookings both because renewal bookings will be lower and, to a lesser extent, because renewals also remain an important selling opportunity for new products. Renewal bookings for fiscal 2012, which generally do not include new product and capacity sales and professional services arrangements, were slightly better than the 15% year over year decline we previously expected. This decline was primarily due to the aforementioned license agreement with a large IT outsourcer executed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We currently expect our fiscal 2013 renewal portfolio to decline in the single digits compared with fiscal 2012. We currently expect the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to have the lowest level of renewals for the fiscal year. For fiscal 2012, our renewal yield was slightly below 90%. During fiscal 2012, we took steps to improve our performance in Europe, Middle East and Africa. Some of the steps include: (1) the appointment of a new regional executive with the intent to bring a more disciplined approach to our renewal process; and (2) the remapping of our sales coverage model to better align and focus on countries with the most resilient IT spending. Both of these steps are designed to accelerate new product sales and improve account penetration. We believe that over time these steps will help improve performance in Europe, Middle East and Africa, although we also believe that the macro economic climate will continue to be a challenge in this region. Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings is an indicator that normalizes the bookings recorded in the current period to account for contract length. It is calculated by dividing the total value of all new subscription and maintenance license agreements entered into during a period by the weighted average subscription and license agreement duration in years for all such subscription and maintenance license agreements recorded during the same period. For fiscal 2012, annualized subscription and maintenance bookings decreased from $1,230 million in fiscal 2011 to $1,091 million, due to the decrease in subscription and maintenance bookings from fiscal 2011. The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years of 3.46 for fiscal 2012 was consistent with fiscal 2011. Although each contract is subject to terms negotiated by the respective parties, we do not currently expect the weighted average subscription and maintenance agreement duration in years to change materially from current levels for end user contracts. For fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, subscription and maintenance bookings were $4,256 million and $4,322 million, respectively. The decrease in subscription and maintenance bookings was primarily attributable to a decrease in mainframe new product and capacity sales. During fiscal 2011, we renewed a total of 56 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $1,994 million. This includes a license agreement with a large IT outsourcer for approximately $500 million signed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. This license agreement extends through fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2010, we renewed a total of 68 license agreements with incremental contract values in excess of $10 million each, for an aggregate contract value of $2,146 million. For fiscal 2011, annualized subscription and maintenance bookings increased from $1,221 million in fiscal 2010 to $1,230 million in fiscal 2011. The weighted average subscription and maintenance license agreement duration in years decreased slightly from 3.54 in fiscal 2010 to 3.46 in fiscal 2011. 33 Table of Contents Selected Quarterly Information FISCAL 2012 QUARTER ENDED TOTAL JUNE 30 SEPT. 30 DEC. 31 MAR. 31 (in millions, except per share and percentage amounts) Revenue $ 1,163 $ 1,200 $ 1,263 $ 1,188 $ 4,814 Percentage of annual revenue 24 % 25 % 26 % 25 % 100 % Costs of licensing and maintenance $ 67 $ 71 $ 69 $ 79 $ 286 Cost of professional services $ 88 $ 91 $ 91 $ 87 $ 357 Amortization of capitalized software costs $ 50 $ 55 $ 59 $ 61 $ 225 Income from continuing operations $ 228 $ 236 $ 263 $ 211 $ 938 Basic income per common share from continuing operations $ 0.45 $ 0.47 $ 0.54 $ 0.45 $ 1.91 Diluted income per common share from continuing operations $ 0.45 $ 0.47 $ 0.54 $ 0.45 $ 1.90 FISCAL 2011 QUARTER ENDED TOTAL JUNE 30 SEPT. 30 DEC. 31 MAR. 31 (in millions, except per share and percentage amounts) Revenue $ 1,069 $ 1,088 $ 1,144 $ 1,128 $ 4,429 Percentage of annual revenue 24 % 25 % 26 % 25 % 100 % Costs of licensing and maintenance $ 67 $ 66 $ 74 $ 71 $ 278 Cost of professional services $ 71 $ 75 $ 77 $ 80 $ 303 Amortization of capitalized software costs $ 45 $ 47 $ 52 $ 48 $ 192 Income from continuing operations $ 221 $ 219 $ 196 $ 187 $ 823 Basic income per common share from continuing operations $ 0.43 $ 0.43 $ 0.38 $ 0.37 $ 1.60 Diluted income per common share from continuing operations $ 0.43 $ 0.43 $ 0.38 $ 0.37 $ 1.60 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with 64% held in our subsidiaries outside the United States at March 31, 2012. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2,679 million at March 31, 2012, representing a decrease of $549 million from the March 31, 2011 balance of $3,228 million. The decrease in cash was primarily due to the utilization of cash to pay for common stock repurchases and dividends and to repay our revolving credit facility due August 2012. During fiscal 2012, there was a $67 million unfavorable translation effect from foreign currency exchange rates on cash held outside the United States in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although 64% of our cash and cash equivalents is held by foreign subsidiaries, we currently neither intend nor anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to the United States in the foreseeable future. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and our investing and financing activities, including, among other things, the payment of regular quarterly dividends, compliance with our debt repayment schedules, repurchases of our common stock and the funding for capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from foreign operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and investing activities, including, among other things, the funding for capital expenditures for acquisitions and research and development, for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. Sources and Uses of Cash Under our subscription and maintenance agreements, customers generally make installment payments over the term of the agreement, often with at least one payment due at contract execution, for the right to use our software products and receive product support, software fixes and new products when available. The timing and actual amounts of cash received from committed customer installment payments under any specific agreement can be affected by several factors, including the time value of money and the customers credit rating. Often, the amount received is the result of direct negotiations with the customer when establishing pricing and payment terms. In certain instances, the customer negotiates a price for a single up front installment payment and seeks its own internal or external financing sources. In other instances, we may assist the customer by arranging financing on their behalf through a third party financial institution. Alternatively, we may decide to transfer our rights to the future committed installment payments due under the license agreement to a third party financial institution in exchange for a cash payment. Once transferred, the future committed installments are payable by the customer to the third party financial institution. Whether the future committed installments have been financed directly by the customer with our assistance or by the transfer of our rights to future committed installments to a third party, these financing agreements may contain limited recourse provisions with respect to our continued performance under the license agreements. Based on our historical experience, we believe that any liability that we may incur as a result of these limited recourse provisions will be immaterial. 34 Table of Contents Amounts billed or collected as a result of a single installment for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, rather than being invoiced and collected over the life of the license agreement, are reflected in the liability section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Deferred revenue (billed or collected). Amounts received from either a customer or a third party financial institution that are attributable to later years of a license agreement have a positive impact on billings and cash provided by operating activities in the current period. Accordingly, to the extent such collections are attributable to the later years of a license agreement, billings and cash provided by operating activities during the licenses later years will be lower than if the payments were received over the license term. We are unable to predict with certainty the amount of cash to be collected from single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, under new or renewed license agreements to be executed in future periods. For fiscal 2012, gross receipts related to single installments for the entire contract value, or a substantial portion of the contract value, were $479 million compared with $542 million in fiscal 2011. In any quarter, we may receive payments in advance of the contractually committed date on which the payments are otherwise due. In limited circumstances, we may offer discounts to customers to ensure payment in the current period of invoices that have been billed, but might not otherwise be paid until a subsequent period because of payment terms or other factors. Historically, any such discounts have not been material. Amounts due from customers from our subscription licenses are offset by deferred revenue related to these license agreements, leaving no or minimal net carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for those amounts. The fair value of those amounts may exceed or be less than this carrying value but cannot be practically assessed since there is no existing market for a pool of customer receivables with contractual commitments similar to those owned by us. The actual fair value may not be known until these amounts are sold, securitized or collected. Although these customer license agreements commit the customer to payment under a fixed schedule, to the extent amounts are not yet due and payable by the customer, the agreements are considered executory in nature due to our ongoing commitment to provide maintenance and unspecified future software products as part of the agreement terms. We can estimate the total amounts to be billed from committed contracts, referred to as our billings backlog, and the total amount to be recognized as revenue from committed contracts, referred to as our revenue backlog. The aggregate amounts of our billings backlog and trade and installment receivables already reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the amounts we expect to collect in the future from committed contracts. MARCH 31, 2012 MARCH 31, 2011 (in millions) (in millions) Billings backlog: Amounts to be billed current $ 2,220 $ 2,234 Amounts to be billed noncurrent 2,623 2,960 Total billings backlog $ 4,843 $ 5,194 Revenue backlog: Revenue to be recognized within the next 12 months current $ 3,714 $ 3,724 Revenue to be recognized beyond the next 12 months noncurrent 4,759 5,036 Total revenue backlog $ 8,473 $ 8,760 Deferred revenue (billed or collected) $ 3,630 $ 3,566 Total billings backlog 4,843 5,194 Total revenue backlog $ 8,473 $ 8,760 Note:Revenue backlog includes deferred subscription and maintenance and professional services revenue. We can also estimate the total cash to be collected in the future from committed contracts, referred to as our Expected future cash collections, by adding the total billings backlog to the current trade accounts receivable, which represent amounts already billed but not collected, from our Consolidated Balance Sheets. MARCH 31, 2012 MARCH 31, 2011 (in millions) (in millions) Expected future cash collections: Total billings backlog $ 4,843 $ 5,194 Trade accounts receivable current, net 902 849 Total expected future cash collections $ 5,745 $ 6,043 35 Table of Contents The decrease in total revenue backlog and billings backlog from fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to an unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, the decrease in year over year bookings associated with the five year license agreement with a large IT outsourcer signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and the increase in the bookings recognized as software fees and other revenue in fiscal 2012 (which would not be reflected in the total revenue backlog at fiscal year end). Current revenue backlog was unfavorably affected by foreign exchange. Excluding this effect, total current revenue backlog would have increased 1% in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011. The decrease in expected future cash collections from fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the decrease in billings backlog. The decrease in total billings backlog was a result of an unfavorable effect of foreign exchange and the aforementioned decrease in total bookings. Unbilled amounts relating to subscription licenses are mostly collectible over a period of one to five years and at March 31, 2012, on a cumulative basis, 46%, 77%, 91%, 99% and 100% come due within fiscal 2013 through 2017, respectively. Cash Provided by Operating Activities YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, $ CHANGE 2012 2011 2010 2012 / 2011 2011 / 2010 (in millions) Cash collections from billings(1) $ 5,142 $ 4,774 $ 4,653 $ 368 $ 121 Vendor disbursements and payroll(1) (3,235 ) (3,075 ) (2,896 ) (160 ) (179 ) Income tax payments (420 ) (222 ) (329 ) (198 ) 107 Other disbursements, net(2) 18 (100 ) (92 ) 118 (8 ) Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,505 $ 1,377 $ 1,336 $ 128 $ 41 (1) Amounts include value added taxes and sales taxes. (2) Amounts include interest, restructuring and miscellaneous receipts and disbursements. Fiscal 2012 versus Fiscal 2011 Operating Activities: Cash provided by continuing operating activities for fiscal 2012 was $1,505 million, representing an increase of $128 million compared with fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash collections from billings of $368 million, offset by an increase in income tax payments of $198 million and an increase in vendor, payroll and other disbursements of $42 million. Investing Activities: Cash used in continuing investing activities for fiscal 2012 was $455 million compared with $700 million for fiscal 2011. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease of $360 million in our net investment activities in marketable securities. During fiscal 2012, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities were approximately $207 million, of which $180 million was due to the liquidation of a majority of our marketable securities portfolio during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $135 million. Financing Activities: Cash used in continuing financing activities for fiscal 2012 was $1,330 million compared with $320 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in common shares repurchased of $818 million, the repayment of $250 million under our revolving credit facility due August 2012 and an increase in annual dividends paid of $110 million as a result of the new capital allocation program approved by our Board of Directors during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These increases were partially offset by an increase in borrowing positions outstanding of $139 million relating to our notional pooling arrangement. Refer to the Debt Arrangements table below for additional information about our debt balances at March 31, 2012. Fiscal 2011 versus Fiscal 2010 Operating Activities: Cash provided by continuing operating activities for fiscal 2011 was $1,377 million, representing an increase of $41 million compared with fiscal 2010. This growth reflects a year over year increase of $58 million in up front cash collections from single installment payments, an increase in collections from billings of $63 million and a decrease in income tax payments of $107 million. These favorable variances were mostly offset by an increase in disbursements of $187 million, primarily attributable to acquisitions. 36 Table of Contents Investing Activities: Cash used in continuing investing activities for fiscal 2011 was $700 million compared with $888 million for fiscal 2010. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in acquisition related costs of $365 million and a decrease in capitalized software costs of $18 million. These decreases were partially offset by our net investment in marketable securities of $181 million. Financing Activities: Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2011 was $320 million compared with $705 million in fiscal 2010. The changes in cash used in financing activities were primarily due to the refinancing of our debt, which occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. At that time, we repaid debt of $1,196 million and issued debt, net of debt issuance costs, of $738 million and received proceeds of $61 million from the exercise of a call spread option associated with our 1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due December 2009. During fiscal 2011, we purchased $235 million of our common stock, compared with $227 million in fiscal 2010. Refer to the Debt Arrangements table below for additional information about our debt balances at March 31, 2011. Debt Arrangements Our debt arrangements consisted of the following: AT MARCH 31, 2012 2011 (in millions) Revolving credit facility due August 2012 $ $ 250 Revolving credit facility due August 2016 5.375% Notes due November 2019 750 750 6.125% Notes due December 2014, net of unamortized premium from fair value hedge of $27 and $15 527 515 Other indebtedness, primarily capital leases 29 42 Unamortized discount for Notes (5 ) (6 ) Total debt outstanding 1,301 1,551 Less the current portion (14 ) (269 ) Total long term debt portion $ 1,287 $ 1,282 We have entered into interest rate swaps to convert $500 million of our 6.125% Notes into floating interest rate payments through December 1, 2014. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay quarterly interest at an average rate of 2.88% plus the three month LIBOR rate, and will receive payment at 5.625%. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to the date of the interest payment. At March 31, 2012, the fair value of these derivatives was an asset of $27 million, of which $11 million is included in Other current assets and $16 million is included in Other noncurrent assets, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The carrying value of the 6.125% Notes was adjusted by an amount that is equal and offsetting to the fair value of the swaps. In April 2011, we repaid the $250 million outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility that was due August 2012. In August 2011, we replaced the revolving credit facility due August 2012 with a new revolving credit facility due August 2016. The maximum committed amount available under the revolving credit facility due August 2016 is $1 billion. The facility also provides us with an option to increase the available credit by an amount up to $500 million. This option is subject to certain conditions and the agreement of the facility lenders. At March 31, 2012, our senior unsecured notes were rated Baa2 (stable) by Moodys Investor Services, BBB+ (stable) by Standard and Poors, and BBB+ (stable) by Fitch Ratings. For further information on our debt balances, refer to Note 9, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock Repurchases On May 12, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorized us to acquire up to an additional $500 million of our common stock, in addition to the previous $500 million program approved on May 12, 2010. Under the $2.5 billion capital allocation program approved by our Board of Directors on January 23, 2012, we are authorized to acquire up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through fiscal 2014, including $232 million remaining at December 31, 2011 under our previous share repurchase authorizations described above. As part of the capital allocation program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 with a bank to purchase $500 million of our common stock. The total number of shares repurchased will depend on our average stock price during the period of the agreement. Under the 37 Table of Contents agreement, we paid $500 million to the bank for an initial delivery of approximately 15 million shares and will either receive or deliver additional shares at settlement. The fair market value of approximately 15 million shares on the date received was approximately $375 million and is included in Treasury stock in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2012. The remaining $125 million is included in Additional paid in capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2012. The accelerated share repurchase transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Including the initial accelerated share repurchase delivery, we repurchased approximately 41 million shares our common stock for approximately $925 million during fiscal 2012. The timing and amount of share repurchases will be determined by our management based on evaluation of market conditions, trading price, legal requirements, and other factors. Dividends We have paid cash dividends each year since July 1990. For fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we paid annual cash dividends of $0.40, $0.16 and $0.16 per share, respectively. We paid cash dividends of $0.05 per share in each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2012. On January 23, 2012 our Board of Directors approved a capital allocation program that targets the return of up to $2.5 billion to shareholders through fiscal 2014. This includes an increase in the annual dividend from $0.20 to $1.00 per share on our common stock as and when declared by the Board of Directors. We paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. For each of fiscal 2011 and 2010, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.04 per share. Effect of Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Changes There was a $67 million unfavorable effect to our cash balances in fiscal 2012 predominantly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro (6%), Brazilian real (12%), Canadian dollar (3%), South African rand (13%) and Indian rupee (14%). There was an $89 million favorable effect to our cash balances in fiscal 2011 predominantly due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro (5%), Brazilian real (10%), Australian dollar (13%), Canadian dollar (5%), Swedish krona (14%) and Swiss franc (15%). Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties and, accordingly, off balance sheet risks to our liquidity and capital resources from unconsolidated entities are limited. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We have commitments under certain contractual arrangements to make future payments for goods and services. These contractual arrangements secure the rights to various assets and services to be used in the future in the normal course of business. For example, we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements. In accordance with current accounting rules, the future rights and related obligations pertaining to such contractual arrangements are not reported as assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to fund these contractual arrangements with cash generated from operations in the normal course of business. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at March 31, 2012 and the timing and effect that those commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods. In addition, the table summarizes the timing of payments on our debt obligations as reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2012. PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TOTAL LESS THAN1 YEAR 13YEARS 35YEARS MORE THAN5 YEARS (in millions) Long term debt obligations (inclusive of interest) $ 1,627 $ 55 $ 617 $ 84 $ 871 Operating lease obligations(1) 535 103 168 107 157 Purchase obligations 136 99 37 Other obligations(2) 63 31 22 6 4 Total $ 2,361 $ 288 $ 844 $ 197 $ 1,032 (1) The contractual obligations for noncurrent operating leases exclude sublease income totaling $23 million expected to be received in the following periods: $7 million (less than 1 year); $7 million (13 years); $4 million (35 years); and $5 million (more than 5 years). (2) Approximately $641 million of estimated liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits are excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of when those amounts will become payable could not be made. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to help ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the significant accounting policies that we use. Many of 38 Table of Contents these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a high degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change. We consider the following significant accounting policies to be critical because of their complexity and the high degree of judgment involved in implementing them. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from the following primary sources: (1) licensing software products, including SaaS license agreements; (2) providing customer technical support (referred to as maintenance); and (3) providing professional services, such as product implementation, consulting and education. Software license agreements under our subscription model include the right to receive and use unspecified future software products for no additional fee during the term of the agreement. We are required under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to recognize revenue from these subscription licenses ratably over the term of the agreement. These amounts are recorded as subscription and maintenance revenue. We also license our software products without the right to unspecified future software products. Revenue from these arrangements is either recognized at the inception of the license agreement (up front basis) or ratably over the term of any maintenance agreement that is bundled with the license. Revenue is recognized up front only when we have established VSOE for all of the undelivered elements of the agreement. We use the residual method to determine the amount of license revenue to be recognized up front. The residual method allocates arrangement consideration to the undelivered elements based upon VSOE of the fair value of those elements, with the residual of the arrangement consideration allocated to the license. The portion allocated to the license is recognized up front once all four of the revenue recognition criteria are met. We establish VSOE of the fair value of maintenance from either contractually stated renewal rates or using the bell shaped curve method. VSOE of the fair value of professional services is established based on hourly rates when sold on a stand alone basis. Up front revenue is recorded as Software Fees and Other. Revenue recognized on an up front model will result in higher total revenue in a reporting period than if that revenue was recognized ratably. If VSOE does not exist for all undelivered elements of an arrangement, we recognize total revenue from the arrangement ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement. Revenue recognized ratably is recorded as Subscription and maintenance revenue. Revenue recognition does not commence until (1) we have evidence of an arrangement with a customer; (2) we deliver the specified products; (3) license agreement terms are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that it may not be complete and final; and (4) collection is probable. Revenue from sales to distributors and volume partners, value added resellers and exclusive representatives commences, either on an up front basis or ratably as described above, when these entities sell the software product to their customers. This is commonly referred to as the sell through method. Revenue from professional service arrangements is generally recognized as the services are performed. Revenue and costs from committed professional services that are sold as part of a software license agreement are deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the life of the related software transaction. In the event that agreements with our customers are executed in close proximity of other license agreements with the same customer, we evaluate whether the separate arrangements are linked, and, if so, they are considered a single multi element arrangement for which revenue is recognized ratably as Subscription and maintenance revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have an established business practice of offering installment payment options to customers and a history of successfully collecting substantially all amounts due under those agreements. We assess collectability based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer. If, in our judgment, collection of a fee is not probable, we will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed through the receipt of cash payment. We do not typically offer installment payments for perpetual license agreements that are recognized up front, within Software fees and other. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on our revenue recognition policy. 39 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is a reserve for the impairment of accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In developing the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts, we rely on several factors, including: Historical information, such as general collection history of multi year software agreements; Current customer information and events, such as extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy; Results of analyzing historical and current data; and The overall macroeconomic environment. The allowance includes two components: (1) specifically identified receivables that are reviewed for impairment when, based on current information, we do not expect to collect the full amount due from the customer; and (2) an allowance for losses inherent in the remaining receivable portfolio based on historical activity. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, along with net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates on income in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. We utilize a more likely than not threshold for the recognition and derecognition of tax positions and measure positions accordingly. We reflect changes in recognition or measurement in a period in which the change in judgment occurs. We record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Goodwill, Capitalized Software Products, and Other Intangible Assets We adopted the Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment (ASU 2011 08) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The implementation of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our goodwill impairment evaluations. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. In accordance with ASU 2011 08, we first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount, and, if so, we then apply the two step impairment test. The two step impairment test first compares the fair value of our reporting units, which are the same as our operating segments, to their carrying (i.e., book) value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill and if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Prior to fiscal 2012, we tested for goodwill impairment at the consolidated entity level which was consistent with our single operating segment. The reorganization in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 of our internal management reporting resulted in a change from a single operating segment to three operating segments which required the allocation of goodwill among our three operating segments. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed our allocation of goodwill, tested for goodwill impairment for each of our reporting units and have concluded that no goodwill impairment exists. Based on our impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the unit by more than 10% of the carrying value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include the revenue growth rates and operating profit margins that are used to project future cash flows, discount rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared costs among reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions that are consistent with information used by the business for planning purposes and that we believe to be reasonable; however, actual future results may differ from those estimates. Changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially affect the value of the reporting unit. 40 Table of Contents The carrying values of capitalized software products, for purchased software, internally developed software and other intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability on a quarterly basis. The facts and circumstances considered include an assessment of the net realizable value for capitalized software products and the recoverability of the cost of other intangible assets from future cash flows to be derived from the use of the asset. It is not possible for us to predict the likelihood of any possible future impairments or, if such an impairment were to occur, the magnitude of any impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are subject to amortization over the expected period of economic benefit to us. We evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives of intangible assets. In cases where a revision to the remaining amortization period is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful life. Accounting for Business Combinations The allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in process research and development, and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Product Development and Enhancements GAAP specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates. If other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility, the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been affected. Annual amortization of capitalized software costs is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product, generally estimated to be five years from the date the product became available for general release to customers. We amortize capitalized software costs using the straight line method. Accounting for Share Based Compensation We currently maintain several stock based compensation plans. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of certain share based awards. The Black Scholes model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected lives, and risk free interest rates. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, but these items involve uncertainties based on market and other conditions outside of our control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, stock based compensation expense could have been materially affected. Furthermore, if different assumptions are used in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially affected in future years. As described in Note 15, Stock Plans, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, performance share units (PSUs) are awards under the long term incentive programs for senior executives where the number of shares or restricted shares, as applicable, ultimately received by the senior executives depends on our performance measured against specified targets and will be determined at the conclusion of the three year or one year period, as applicable. The fair value of each award is estimated on the date that the performance targets are established based on the fair value of our stock and our estimate of the level of achievement of our performance targets. We are required to recalculate the fair value of issued PSUs each reporting period until the underlying shares are granted. The adjustment is based on the quoted market price of our stock on the reporting period date. Each quarter, we compare the actual performance we expect to achieve with the performance targets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The measurement of fair value for our financial instruments is based on the authoritative guidance which establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on three levels of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. See Note 11, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information. We are exposed to financial market risks arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Changes in interest rates could affect our monetary assets and liabilities, and foreign exchange rate changes could affect our foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions. We enter into derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating a portion of these risks. See Note 10, Derivatives, for additional information. All marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other 41 Table of Contents comprehensive income until realized. Premiums and discounts on debt securities recorded at the date of purchase are recognized in Interest expense, net using the effective interest method. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such investments are reported as Interest expense, net and are computed using the specific identification cost method. For marketable securities in an unrealized loss position, we are required to assess whether we intend to sell the security or will more likely than not be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss. If either of these conditions is met, an other than temporary impairment on the security is recognized in Interest expense, net equal to the entire difference between its fair value and amortized cost basis. See Note 5, Marketable Securities, for additional information. Legal Contingencies We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability of a loss and the determination as to whether the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, the decision to record an accrual and the amount of accruals recorded are based only on the information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and claims, and may revise our estimates. Any revisions could have a material effect on our results of operations. Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our material legal proceedings. New Accounting Pronouncements Presentation of Comprehensive Income: In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011 05), to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011 05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011 05 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and debt. We have a prescribed methodology whereby we invest our excess cash in investments that are composed of money market funds, debt instruments of government agencies and investment grade corporate issuers (Standard and Poors single BBB+ rating and higher). At March 31, 2012, our outstanding debt was $1,301 million, all of which was in fixed rate obligations. Refer to Note 9, Debt, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. At March 31, 2012, we had interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $500 million that swap a total of $500 million of our 6.125% Senior Notes due December 2014 into floating interest rate debt through December 1, 2014. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and are being accounted for in accordance with the shortcut method of FASB ASC Topic 815. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay quarterly interest at an average rate of 2.88%, plus the three month LIBOR rate, and will receive payment at 5.625%. The LIBOR based rate is set quarterly three months prior to date of the interest payment. At March 31, 2012, the fair value of these derivatives was an asset of approximately $27 million, of which approximately $11 million is included in Other current assets and approximately $16 million is included in Other noncurrent assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At March 31, 2011, the fair value of these derivatives was an asset of approximately $15 million, of which approximately $11 million is included in Other current assets and approximately $4 million is included in Other noncurrent assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Each 25 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have a corresponding effect on the annual interest expense related to our interest rates swaps that relate to the 6.125% Notes of approximately $1 million at March 31, 2012. During fiscal 2009, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of $250 million to hedge a portion of our variable interest rate payments on the revolving credit facility. These derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges and matured in October 2010. During fiscal 2011, under the terms of the interest rate swaps, we paid interest at an average annualized rate of 2.83% and received interest payment at the one month LIBOR rate. 42 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business on a worldwide basis through subsidiaries in 47 foreign countries and, as such, a portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk in part through operational means, including managing expected local currency revenues in relation to local currency costs and local currency assets in relation to local currency liabilities. In October 2005, our Board of Directors adopted our Risk Management Policy and Procedures, which authorize us to manage, based on managements assessment, our risks and exposures to foreign currency exchange rates through the use of derivative financial instruments (e.g., forward contracts, options and swaps) or other means. We only use derivative financial instruments in the context of hedging and do not use them for speculative purposes. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, we did not designate our foreign exchange derivatives as hedges. Accordingly, all foreign exchange derivatives are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and unrealized or realized changes in fair value from these contracts are recorded as Other expenses, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 10, Derivatives for additional information regarding our derivative activities. If foreign currency exchange rates affecting our business weakened by 10% on an overall basis in comparison to the U.S. dollar, the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would report in U.S. dollars would decrease by approximately $172 million.
