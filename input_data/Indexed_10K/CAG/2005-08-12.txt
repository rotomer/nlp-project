ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to the companys financial performance and condition. The discussion should be read together with the companys financial statements and related notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Results for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2005 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future.

Fiscal 2004 diluted earnings per share were $1.53, with continuing operations contributing $1.37, discontinued operations contributing $0.18, and a change in accounting resulting in a loss of $0.02. Several items affect the comparability of results of continuing operations, as discussed in Other Significant Items of Note, below. Multi Year Marketing, Operating and Business Process Improvement Initiatives ConAgra Foods is focused on sales and marketing, operating, and business process improvement initiatives that are key to profitable future growth and stronger returns on capital. Sales and Marketing Initiatives: Growing volumes and improving product mix is essential to long term success, and requires the company to develop its brands, enhance customer service, find new customers, and go to market with new products that are responsive to consumer preference. The company is currently implementing fact based analytical methods for assessing the potential of its brands and products in a disciplined process. This is designed to bring a consistency to the marketing function across retail, foodservice, and ingredients operations. These methods address the fundamentals of the products we sell taste profile, packaging, product quality, and nutritional statistics and also help design appropriate consumer communication through advertising and promotion campaigns, store merchandising programs, and appropriate price points. Operating Initiatives: The company is striving to achieve cost savings by integrating and upgrading the supply chain. The primary areas of emphasis are purchasing, logistics, manufacturing, and the reduction of SKUs (stock keeping units, or individual products). Purchasing: The company is in the process of consolidating the purchasing activity for major inputs to more effectively and efficiently purchase inputs used across its segments. Logistics: The company is transitioning from a network of several hundred warehouses across the country to a network defined by 14 mixing centers that will support retail and foodservice operations in strategic locations. This new structure is intended to better utilize truckload shipments and optimize warehouse investment, while also reducing working capital as excess inventory quantities are eliminated. Manufacturing: The company has been developing plans to consolidate manufacturing facilities, under which 14 inefficient plants will most likely be closed and sold over time. The company expects savings to come from rationalizing plants, and thereby increasing capacity utilization, as well as from implementing best practices relating to overall efficiency throughout all plants. SKU Rationalization: The company has reduced low volume, low margin SKUs over the past few quarters, and plans to continue to do this more aggressively over the next 2 3 years. SKU reduction is expected to reduce complexity and save money throughout the entire supply chain, and also result in an increased focus on the SKUs that have higher profit potential. General and Administrative Expense and Headcount Reduction: The company is pursuing specific plans for reductions in its anticipated SG&A (selling, general and administrative) cost structure, and those plans include salaried headcount reduction. The reduction of several hundred salaried personnel will be completed by the end of the first quarter in fiscal 2006; those headcount reductions, along with other SG&A expense reduction programs, are expected to save more than $100 million annually once the programs are completed. Business Process Improvement Initiatives: The company is currently changing its business processes and implementing new information systems so that it has improved connections between the manufacturing, marketing, sales, logistics, customer service and accounting functions. The new processes are intended to improve operating efficiency and relationships with customers and vendors. This is being done through Project Nucleus, which integrates the new information technology platforms and allows the company to better manage important areas such as trade merchandising programs, order management, inventory management, customer payment and collections, and logistics. Packaged Meats The companys packaged meats operations in the retail and foodservice segments posted weak results in fiscal 2005, resulting primarily from higher input costs and ineffective pricing actions that did not recover the increased costs. The company anticipated aggressive pricing actions scheduled during the second half of fiscal 2005 to improve results, however, those pricing actions were not executed effectively. Also, manufacturing challenges resulting from the installation of new equipment, consolidation of plant locations and transfer of production across plant locations resulted in the disruption of the companys ability to fill customer orders for certain products, primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 packaged meats operating profits decreased by approximately $150 million as compared to fiscal 2004. The company has made several changes within the packaged meats operations, including changes to strengthen leadership, and expects these changes, along with better pricing management, aggressive cost savings initiatives and SKU reduction to improve the packaged meats operations over time. Cost Reduction Efforts In fiscal 2004, the company identified specific operating efficiency initiatives as part of an effort to improve the companys cost structure, margins and competitive position. As a result of these specific initiatives, the company recognized incremental expenses of $21 million and $62 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The company does not anticipate additional costs associated with these initiatives. In addition, the company undertook in fiscal 2005 the general and administrative and headcount reductions described above. The company recognized $43 million of severance expense during fiscal 2005 and does not anticipate significant additional costs in fiscal 2006 related to the headcount reduction. The company created and funded a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Trust (VEBA) for the purpose of funding benefit payments to participants in the companys postretirement benefit plans and severance payments to employees terminated under the companys salaried headcount reduction. The company contributed $75 million to the VEBA in May 2005. 15 Divestitures During fiscal 2005, the company substantially completed the repositioning of its portfolio to focus on higher margin, branded and value added businesses through additional divestitures. Current year dispositions included the companys: international crop inputs businesses (UAP International), minority equity investment in Swift Foods and cattle feeding assets, specialty meats foodservice business, and Portuguese poultry business. These divestitures, combined with prior years divestitures of the companys chicken business, U.S. and Canadian crop inputs businesses of United Agri Products (UAP North America), Spanish feed business, fresh beef and pork operations, canned seafood operations and cheese operations, substantially completed the multi year program aimed at divesting the companys non core businesses. The results of operations of the chicken business, UAP North America, UAP International, the Spanish feed business and Portuguese poultry business, and the specialty meats foodservice business are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning September 24, 2004, the results of operations of the cattle feeding business are presented in discontinued operations. Capital Allocation During fiscal 2005, the company reduced its debt by almost $1.2 billion, reducing its debt to total capital ratio from 54% in fiscal 2004 to 48% in fiscal 2005 (total capital is defined as debt plus common stockholders equity). Included in fiscal 2005 results is a $22 million loss, reflected in selling, general and administrative expense, from the early retirement of certain debt. In addition, as part of the companys previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program, the company repurchased approximately 7 million shares at a total cost of $181 million. In fiscal 2004, the company repurchased 15 million shares at a total cost of $419 million. The company continues to assess its allocation of capital and periodically reviews the appropriateness and timing with respect to the continuation of the share repurchase program. The company paid dividends of $550 million and $537 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Inflation During fiscal 2005 and 2004, the companys commodity and other input costs, on average, were higher than those in prior years, resulting in higher cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2005 and 2004, inflation resulted in increased operating costs of more than $400 million and more than $350 million, respectively. The company was able to recover a portion of these increased costs through increased pricing and operational savings, but gross margins declined in fiscal 2005, particularly in the packaged meats operations. Other Significant Items of Note The prior year included 53 weeks of operations while the current year includes 52 weeks as a result of the companys year end being the last Sunday of May. The estimated impact on the companys results of operations due to the extra week in fiscal 2004 was additional net sales of approximately $281 million and additional segment operating profit of approximately $41 million. During fiscal 2005, the company recognized: two equity method investment impairment charges totaling $71 million, $66 million after tax, a charge of $21.5 million in connection with the expected settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a benefit of $17 million for legal settlements in the Retail Products segment, 16 asset impairment charges totaling $25 million, $15 million after tax, relating to a Retail Products brand impairment as well as an impairment associated with a plant closure in the companys Food Ingredients segment, the uninsured portion of a casualty loss of $10 million, $6 million after tax, resulting from a fire at an insured Foodservice Products processing facility, and a pre tax gain of approximately $186 million from the sale of ten million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock in December 2004. Opportunities and Challenges The company believes that its sales and marketing and operating initiatives will favorably influence future profits, profit margins and returns on capital. Because of the scope of change underway, there is risk in successfully implementing these broad change initiatives. As described above, the company has made several changes to its retail and foodservice packaged meats businesses. The company expects these changes to improve the profitability of these operations over time. However, competitive pressures, input costs and the execution of the operational changes, among other factors, will affect the future profitability of these operations and the timing of any profit recovery. The company is facing increased costs for many of its significant raw materials, packaging and energy inputs. When appropriate, the company uses long term purchase contracts, futures and options to reduce the volatility of these costs. The company has also recently implemented sales price increases for certain products and will continue to evaluate further price increases based on raw material cost trends, expected impact on sales volumes and other factors. Changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of the companys products. The company offers a variety of food products which appeal to a range of consumer preferences and utilizes innovation and marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing consumer trends. As part of these programs, the company introduces new products and product extensions. Consolidation of many of the companys customers continues to result in increased buying power, negotiating strength and complex service requirements for those customers. This trend, which is expected to continue, may negatively impact gross margins, particularly in the Retail Products segment. In order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation, during fiscal 2004 the company consolidated its sales force to more efficiently service its customers. In fiscal 2003, the companys retail customer service centers were consolidated into one specialized facility to service all retail channel customers. The company continues to streamline its distribution network in order to reduce costs and increase its responsiveness to customer needs. Restatement and Internal Control Remediation Matters During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2005, the company conducted reviews that led to the discovery of errors related to accounting for income taxes in previously reported amounts. To correct the errors discovered, the company restated financial statements for the periods covered in its Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2004 and the Forms 10 Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2005. The company has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over accounting for income taxes as of May 29, 2005, and has determined that the accounting errors referenced above and the potential for additional misstatements indicate a material weakness in internal control over accounting for income taxes. Progress has been made in implementing managements plans to remediate the material weakness, including reorganization of the tax department, hiring of a new Vice President of Tax and other tax and tax accounting professionals, design of enhanced control processes over accounting for income taxes, implementation of certain enhanced control processes over accounting for income taxes, including general ledger account reconciliation processes, implementation of dual review procedures, and engagement of third party tax specialists to provide additional quality assurance. The company will continue implementing managements remediation plans and will monitor the improvements in the controls over accounting for income taxes to ensure remediation of the material weakness. 17 SEGMENT REVIEW The companys operations are organized into three reporting segments: Retail Products, Foodservice Products and Food Ingredients. The Retail Products reporting segment includes branded foods which are sold in various retail channels and includes frozen, refrigerated and shelf stable temperature classes. The Foodservice Products reporting segment includes branded and customized food products, including meals, entrees, prepared potatoes, meats, seafood, sauces and a variety of custom manufactured culinary products packaged for sale to restaurants and other foodservice establishments. The Food Ingredients reporting segment includes both branded and commodity food ingredients, including milled grain ingredients, seasonings, blends and flavorings, which are sold to food processors, as well as certain commodity trading and merchandising operations. 2005 vs. 2004 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2005 Net Sales Fiscal 2004 Net Sales % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 8,669 $ 8,434 3 % Foodservice Products 3,227 3,274 (1 )% Food Ingredients 2,671 2,374 13 % Total $ 14,567 $ 14,082 3 % Overall company net sales increased $485 million to $14.6 billion, primarily reflecting favorable results in the Food Ingredients segment and a 2% sales volume increase in the Retail Products segment. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $281 million of incremental net sales due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. The company believes that its sales and marketing initiatives (discussed in the Executive Overview) continue to favorably influence brand growth. Retail Products net sales increased $235 million for the year to $8.7 billion. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $165 million of incremental net sales due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Sales volume grew by 2% in fiscal 2005, led by gains in certain key frozen food brands. Sales of the companys top thirty brands, which represent approximately 80% of total segment sales, grew 4% as a group, as sales of some of the companys most significant brands, including Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Marie Callenders, Armour, ACT II, Kid Cuisine, Libbys, Blue Bonnet, PAM, Parkay, Egg Beaters, Swiss Miss, Snack Pack, Hunts, Cooks, Eckrich and Manwich, grew in fiscal 2005, despite the additional week included in results for fiscal 2004. Major brands posting sales declines for the year included Healthy Choice, Butterball, Slim Jim, Hebrew National, LaChoy and County Line. Although the sales and marketing initiatives previously discussed have positively impacted the Retail Products segment net sales for the year, manufacturing challenges resulting from installation of new equipment, consolidation of plant locations and transfer of production across plant locations, and temporary disruptions from the implementation of Project Nucleus, the companys information based business process initiative, resulted in the disruption of the companys ability to fill customer orders for certain products, primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Net sales in the Foodservice Products segment were $3.2 billion, a decrease of $47 million. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $61 million of incremental net sales due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations and $28 million of sales from a business the company divested in fiscal 2004. Sales of specialty potato products increased due to strong volumes during fiscal 2005. However, these increases were more than offset by decreased sales volumes in the culinary and seafood product lines, resulting from manufacturing challenges similar to those discussed in the Retail Products segment discussion, above, as well as the impact of tariffs and related competitive impacts on the seafood product lines. Food Ingredients net sales increased $297 million to $2.7 billion. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $55 18 million of incremental net sales due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. The increase in sales was primarily driven by the growth in trading and merchandising operations, as well as the inclusion of sales to United Agri Products, Inc. and Pilgrims Pride Corporation subsequent to the companys divestitures of UAP North America and the chicken business in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Gross Profit (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2005 Gross Profit Fiscal 2004 Gross Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 2,159 $ 2,289 (6 )% Foodservice Products 517 569 (9 )% Food Ingredients 426 348 22 % Total $ 3,102 $ 3,206 (3 )% The companys gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $3.1 billion, a decrease of $104 million, or 3%, from the prior year. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $60 million of incremental gross profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Gross profit was reduced by $17 million and $34 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, due to costs incurred to implement the companys operational efficiency initiatives. Gross profits were negatively impacted by increased input costs, primarily in the packaged meats operations, coupled with ineffective pricing that did not recover the increased costs. Retail Products gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $2.2 billion, a decrease of $130 million from fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $42 million of incremental gross profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by $13 million and $20 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Increased sales volume of 2% was more than offset by the impact of the increased input costs and ineffective product pricing, particularly in the retail packaged meats operations. The costs of installation of new equipment, consolidation of plant locations and transfer of production across plant locations also negatively impacted gross profit in fiscal 2005. Foodservice Products gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $517 million, a decrease of $52 million over the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $11 million of incremental gross profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by $4 million and $13 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Improved gross profit in the companys specialty potato products, due to increased sales volumes, was more than offset by increased input costs in the foodservice packaged meats operations, reduced sales volumes and margins in the seafood operations and unfavorable production costs associated with a planned plant consolidation. The Food Ingredients segment generated gross profit of $426 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of $78 million over the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $7 million of incremental gross profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Improvements in gross profit are due to favorable market conditions in the companys commodity trading (including petroleum based products) and fertilizer merchandising operations. The company does not expect to achieve this level of gross profits in its trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2006. A difficult cost environment and competitive conditions continued to negatively impact the performance of dehydrated onion, garlic, capsicums, and vegetable based food ingredients. Reporting Segment Fiscal 2005 Gross Margin Fiscal 2004 Gross Margin Retail Products 25 % 27 % Foodservice Products 16 % 17 % Food Ingredients 16 % 15 % Total 21 % 23 % 19 The companys gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for fiscal 2005 decreased two percentage points as compared to fiscal 2004, which reflects the impact of higher input costs, combined with ineffective product pricing, principally in the packaged meats operations. The costs of installation of new equipment, consolidation of plant locations and transfer of production across plant locations, combined with the resulting disruption of the companys ability to fill customer orders for certain higher margin products in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, also contributed to the reduced gross margin. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, includes General Corporate Expense (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $1.8 billion in both fiscal 2005 and 2004. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $34 million in SG&A expense for the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives increased SG&A expenses by $4 million and $27 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The company spent significantly less on advertising and promotion in fiscal 2005 than in the prior year. This reduction was more than offset by increased trade spending, which is reflected as a reduction of net sales. The company also incurred lower incentive compensation expense in fiscal 2005 than in the prior year. Included in fiscal 2005 SG&A expenses are: charges for an impairment of a facility of $15 million in the Food Ingredients segment, a charge of $22 million on the early redemption of $600 million of 7.5% senior debt, a charge of $21.5 million in connection with matters related to an ongoing SEC investigation, a $10 million charge to reflect an impairment of a brand within the Retail Products segment, a benefit of $17 million for legal settlements in the Retail Products segment, a fire loss at a Foodservice Products plant of $10 million, and a charge of $43 million for severance expense in connection with the companys salaried headcount reduction actions. The results for fiscal 2004 include $25 million of litigation expense related to a former choline chloride joint venture with E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. that was sold in 1997, partially offset by a gain of $21 million recognized upon the sale of the companys cost method investment in a venture. In fiscal 2004, the company established reserves of $25 million in connection with matters related to an SEC investigation (see Legal Matters discussion). Advertising and promotion expense was $344 million in fiscal 2005, below the $406 million spent in the prior year. The decline reflects the companys continued implementation of disciplined analyses to evaluate marketing investments as well as overall cost control. The companys marketing activities also include more than $2 billion spent with customers in the form of trade merchandising and trade promotions. Those amounts are reflected as a reduction of net sales in the companys consolidated statements of earnings. Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, gain on the sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock, income taxes and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2005 Operating Profit Fiscal 2004 Operating Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 1,129 $ 1,218 (7 )% Foodservice Products 277 325 (15 )% Food Ingredients 263 197 34 % Retail Products operating profit decreased $89 million for the fiscal year to $1.1 billion. Fiscal 2004 results include 20 an estimated $28 million of incremental operating profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced operating profit by $15 million and $25 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Fiscal 2005 results reflect a $24 million charge in relation to the companys salaried headcount reduction, a benefit of $17 million for favorable legal settlements, and a $10 million charge for an impairment of a brand and related assets. The remaining decline in operating profit is reflective of reduced gross profit, as discussed above, partially offset by reduced expenditures for advertising and promotion. Foodservice Products operating profit declined $48 million to $277 million. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $7 million of incremental operating profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced operating profit by $6 million and $29 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Fiscal 2005 results include a $10 million charge for a fire loss at a Canadian production facility and a $4 million charge in connection with the companys salaried headcount reduction. The remaining decrease in operating profit is due to decreased gross profit, as previously discussed. Food Ingredients operating profit increased $66 million to $263 million, primarily reflecting improved gross profits, as discussed above. Fiscal 2004 results include an estimated $7 million of incremental operating profit due to the inclusion of an additional week of operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced operating profit by $1 million and $8 million in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Fiscal 2005 results include a $15 million charge for the impairment of a facility and a $4 million charge in connection with the companys salaried headcount reduction. The commodity trading and merchandising component of the Food Ingredients segment contributed $186 million and $99 million to operating profit for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2005, net interest expense was $295 million, an increase of $20 million, or 7%, over the prior fiscal year. Increased interest expense reflects a reduced benefit from the interest rate swap agreements terminated in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. These interest rate swap agreements were previously put in place as a strategy to hedge interest costs associated with long term debt and were closed out in fiscal 2004 in order to lock in existing favorable interest rates. For financial statement purposes, the benefit associated with the termination of the interest rate swap agreements continues to be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. As a result, the companys net interest expense was reduced by $41 million during fiscal 2005 and $76 million during fiscal 2004. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the company recognized approximately $14 million of additional interest expense associated with a previously terminated interest rate swap. The company had previously deferred this amount in accumulated other comprehensive income as the interest rate swap was being used to hedge the interest payments associated with the forecasted issuance of debt. During the second quarter, the company determined it was no longer probable such debt would be issued and immediately recognized the entire deferred amount within interest expense. The company also earned less interest income in fiscal 2005 due to the transaction with Swift Foods in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 in which the company took control and ownership of the net assets of the cattle feeding business, thereby terminating the line of credit provided by the company to Swift Foods. These factors have been partially offset by the companys retirement of nearly $1.2 billion of debt during fiscal 2005. Gain on Sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation Common Stock During fiscal 2005, the company sold ten million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $283 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately $186 million. Equity Method Investment Earnings (Loss) Equity method investment earnings (loss) decreased to a $25 million loss in fiscal 2005 as compared to earnings of $44 million in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the company determined that the carrying value of its investments in two unrelated joint ventures were other than temporarily impaired and, therefore, recognized pre tax impairment charges totaling $71 million ($66 million after tax). The extent of the impairments was determined based upon the companys assessment of the recoverability of its investments, including an assessment of the investees ability to sustain earnings which would justify the carrying amount of the investments. In September 2004, the company sold its minority interest equity investment in Swift Foods. Prior year results include approximately $16 million from the 21 companys investment in that joint venture. Income from the companys other equity method investments, which include potato processing and grain merchandising businesses, did not substantially change from their fiscal 2004 amounts. Results of Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations was $22 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2004, the company recognized income from discontinued operations of $97 million, net of tax. The year over year change primarily resulted from: fiscal 2005 net pre tax losses of approximately $52 million related to the disposal of the remaining assets of UAP International and a specialty meats facility, and the impairment of the remaining assets of the specialty meats business, partially offset by a $19 million pre tax gain on the sale of the cattle feeding business, fiscal 2004 pre tax impairment charges of $27 million recognized to write down the long lived assets of the UAP International and Portuguese poultry operations to net realizable value, net pre tax income of $51 million recognized on the sales of the chicken business, UAP North America and the Spanish feed business in fiscal 2004, and profitable operations at the chicken business and UAP North America during the six month period of fiscal 2004 prior to the divestitures, versus net operating losses incurred at the UAP International, cattle feeding and specialty meats businesses in fiscal 2005. The companys UAP North America and UAP International operations had a fiscal year end of February, while the companys consolidated year end is May. Historically, the results of UAP North America and UAP International have been reflected in the companys consolidated results on a three month lag (e.g., UAPs results for December through February are included in the companys consolidated results for the period March through May). Due to the disposition of UAP North America in November 2003, a $24 million net of tax loss, representing the results for the three months ending November 2003, was recorded directly to retained earnings. If this business had not been divested, this net of tax loss would have been recognized in the companys fiscal 2004 consolidated statement of earnings. Due to the disposition of UAP International in April 2005, $2 million net of tax income, representing the results for the three months ending April 2005, was recorded directly to retained earnings. If this business had not been divested, this net of tax income would have been recognized in the companys fiscal 2005 and 2006 consolidated statements of earnings. Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 41% for fiscal 2005 and 37% in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the company increased its estimate of the effective tax rate for state income taxes, resulting in an overall effective tax rate in excess of the statutory rate. The company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to the IRSs examination of the companys tax returns for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. As a result of the resolution of these matters, the company reduced income tax expense and the related provision for income taxes payable by $5 million during fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2004, the company reached an agreement with the IRS with respect to the IRSs examination of the companys tax returns for fiscal years 1996 through 1999. As a result of the resolution of these matters, the company reduced income tax expense by $27 million in fiscal 2004. This was partially offset by the net tax impact related to the divestiture of certain foreign entities which increased income tax expense by approximately $21 million during fiscal 2004. Net income was $642 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005, compared to $811 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004. Legal Matters On June 22, 2001, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2000. The filing included restated financial information for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The restatement, due to accounting and conduct matters at United Agri Products, Inc. (UAP), a former subsidiary, was based upon an investigation undertaken by the company and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. The restatement was principally related to revenue recognition for deferred delivery sales and vendor rebates, advance vendor rebates and 22 bad debt reserves. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a formal order of nonpublic investigation dated September 28, 2001. The company is cooperating with the SEC investigation, which relates to the UAP matters described above, as well as other aspects of the companys financial statements, including the level and application of certain of the companys reserves. The company is currently conducting discussions with the SEC Staff regarding a possible settlement of these matters. Based on discussions to date, the company estimates the amount of such settlement and related payments to be approximately $46.5 million. The company recorded charges of $25 million and $21.5 million in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, respectively, in connection with these matters. There can be no assurance that the negotiations with the SEC Staff will ultimately be successful or that the SEC will accept the terms of any settlement that is negotiated with the SEC Staff. Accordingly, the terms of any settlement, if reached, could result in charges greater than the amount currently estimated and recognized in the companys financial statements. On August 10, 2001, a purported class action lawsuit, Gebhardt v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 810CV427, was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska against the company and certain of its executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the companys June 2001 restatement of its financial statements. The company reached an agreement, which received final approval by the court on May 24, 2005, to settle the lawsuit for $14 million. The settlement, which is largely covered by insurance, is without admission of liability or wrongdoing. Derivative actions were filed by three shareholder plaintiffs, purportedly on behalf of the company, on September 26, 2001, in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware in New Castle County, Case No. 19130NC, and on October 9, 2001, in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, Case No. 401CV3255. The complaints alleged that the defendants, directors of the company during the relevant times, breached fiduciary duties in connection with events resulting in the companys June 2001 restatement of its financial statements. The action sought, inter alia, recovery to the company, which was named as a nominal defendant in the action, of damages allegedly sustained by the company and a direction to the defendants to establish programs to prevent wrongful and illegal practices. The company has reached an agreement to settle the lawsuit for the cost of plaintiffs attorney fees of $0.3 million, which will be covered by insurance. The settlement includes certain undertakings and is without admission of liability or wrongdoing. The settlement was preliminarily approved by the court on June 13, 2005, and following completion of steps incident to the settlement process, will be submitted to the court for final approval. On April 29, 2005, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10 K/A for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2004 and amended quarterly reports on Form 10 Q/A for the quarters ended August 29, 2004 and November 28, 2004. The filings included restated financial information for fiscal years 2002, 2003, 2004 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2005. The restatement related to tax matters. In addition, the company is providing information to the SEC Staff relating to the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement. On June 21, 2005, a purported class action, Berlien v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 805CV292 was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska, and on June 30, 2005, a purported class action, Calvacca v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 805CV00318 was filed in the same court. On July 26, 2005, a purported class action, Woods v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 6707, was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Each lawsuit is against the company and its chief executive officer. The lawsuits allege violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the companys April 2005 restatement of its financial statements relating to tax matters. Each complaint seeks a declaration that the action is maintainable as a class action and that the plaintiff is a proper class representative, unspecified compensatory damages, reasonable attorneys fees and any other relief deemed proper by the court. The company believes the lawsuits are without merit and plans to vigorously defend the actions. On July 15, 2005, two derivative actions were filed by shareholder plaintiff Gerald Halpern, Case No. 805CV342, and shareholder plaintiff Shawn Van Hees, Case No. 805CV343, and on July 26, 2005 a derivative action was filed by shareholder plaintiff Charles Zimmerman, Case No. 405CV3183, purportedly on behalf of the company in United States District Court for Nebraska. The complaints alleged that the defendants, directors and certain executive officers of the company during the relevant times, breached fiduciary duties in connection with events resulting in the companys April 2005 restatement of its financial statements and related matters. The action seeks, inter alia, recovery to the company, which was named as a nominal defendant in the action, of damages allegedly sustained by the company and for reimbursement and restitution. The officers and directors named as defendants in the action intend to vigorously defend 23 the allegations and believe the actions are without merit. On July 18, 2005, purported class actions, Rantala v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 805CV349, and Bright v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 805CV348, were filed in United States District Court for Nebraska. The lawsuits are against the company and its directors and its employee benefits committee on behalf of participants in the companys employee retirement income savings plans. The lawsuits allege violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in connection with the events resulting in the companys April 2005 restatement of its financial statements and related matters. Each complaint seeks unspecified amount of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys fees and other equitable monetary relief. The company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions. 2004 vs. 2003 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2004 Net Sales Fiscal 2003 Net Sales % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 8,434 $ 8,668 (3 )% Foodservice Products 3,274 3,193 3 % Food Ingredients 2,374 2,204 8 % Meat Processing 2,469 (100 )% Total $ 14,082 $ 16,534 (15 )% Overall fiscal 2004 net sales declined $2.5 billion to $14.1 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of the fresh beef and pork divestiture in fiscal 2003 and the sale of the canned seafood and processed cheese related operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 sales included approximately $3.1 billion from the divested businesses, while fiscal 2004 sales included none. These decreases were partially offset by the $281 million estimated impact on net sales of one additional week included in the results of operations for fiscal 2004. Retail Products net sales declined $234 million in fiscal 2004 to $8.4 billion. Included in results for fiscal 2003 were net sales of $493 million from the canned seafood business, which was divested in fiscal 2003. This decrease was partially offset by the estimated impact of one additional week included in the results of operations for fiscal 2004, an increase to net sales of approximately $165 million. Sales of the companys key branded products showed mixed results, as sales of some of the companys most significant brands, including Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Wesson, Slim Jim, PAM, Egg Beaters and Reddi wip, grew on a comparable fifty two week basis. Major brands posting sales declines for the year included Healthy Choice, Butterball, Armour, ACT II and Orville Redenbachers. In addition to the sales and marketing initiatives previously discussed, new products and product extensions in the frozen meals and entrees category, such as Banquet Crock Pot Classics and Life Choice, positively impacted the Retail Products segment net sales for the year. Weak sales volume in popcorn products, driven by intense competition in the category and consumer trends, negatively impacted the segments performance. Net sales in the Foodservice Products segment were $3.3 billion, an increase of $81 million. Included in results for fiscal 2003 were net sales of $93 million from divested businesses. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one additional week of net sales in fiscal 2004 was an increase of approximately $61 million. Sales of specialty potato products and shelf stable and specialty meats within the culinary product line achieved increased sales volumes during fiscal 2004. Improved unit pricing within the specialty potato and specialty meats products also contributed to increased net sales. Food Ingredients net sales increased $170 million to $2.4 billion. The increase in sales was primarily driven by the pass through of increases in commodity raw material costs, favorable results from commodity trading (including petroleum based products) and merchandising and approximately $55 million related to the additional week in fiscal 2004. 24 Due to the fresh beef and pork divestiture, the Meat Processing segment includes no sales for fiscal 2004. Net sales in fiscal 2003 were $2.5 billion. Gross Profit (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2004 Gross Profit Fiscal 2003 Gross Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 2,289 $ 2,455 (7 )% Foodservice Products 569 558 2 % Food Ingredients 348 291 20 % Meat Processing 83 (100 )% Total $ 3,206 $ 3,387 (5 )% The companys gross profit for fiscal 2004 was $3.2 billion, a decrease of $181 million, or 5%, from the prior year. The decrease reflects $168 million of gross profit in fiscal 2003 related to businesses the company no longer owns and $34 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2004 to implement the companys operational efficiency initiatives and higher input costs, which were not fully offset by higher selling prices, offset by an estimated $60 million of gross profit related to the additional week in fiscal 2004. Retail Products gross profit for fiscal 2004 was $2.3 billion, a decrease of $166 million from fiscal 2003. Included in the prior year gross profit was $75 million from the divested canned seafood operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by $20 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal year 2004 was an increase in gross profit of approximately $42 million. Additionally, the segments gross profit decreased due to a less favorable product mix, increased input costs, which were not fully offset by increased selling prices, primarily in packaged meats products and an extremely competitive environment for popcorn products. Foodservice Products gross profit for fiscal 2004 was $569 million, an increase of $11 million over the prior fiscal year. Included in the prior year gross profit was $10 million from businesses divested in that year. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives reduced gross profit by $13 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal year 2004 was an increase of approximately $11 million. The Food Ingredients segment generated gross profit of $348 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of $57 million over fiscal 2003. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of approximately $7 million. Also favorably impacting fiscal 2004 gross profit was improved performance from certain value added food ingredient businesses, which included a $22 million lower of cost or market adjustment to inventory in fiscal 2003 and better results for commodity trading and merchandising operations due to market volatility. Gross profit in the Meat Processing segment was $83 million in fiscal 2003. Reporting Segment Fiscal 2004 Gross Margin Fiscal 2003 Gross Margin Retail Products 27 % 28 % Foodservice Products 17 % 17 % Food Ingredients 15 % 13 % Meat Processing 3 % Total 23 % 20 % The companys gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for fiscal 2004 increased three percentage points as compared to fiscal 2003, which reflects the companys divestitures of low margin operations and 25 improvement in value added food ingredient products, offset by the impact of higher input costs, which were not fully offset by selling price increases, principally in the Retail Products segment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, includes General Corporate Expense SG&A expenses decreased $83 million, or 4%, to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 SG&A expenses included approximately $10 million from divested businesses and $38 million of transaction costs related to the fresh beef and pork divestiture. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives increased SG&A expenses by $27 million in fiscal 2004. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of approximately $34 million. The results for fiscal 2004 include $25 million of litigation expense related to a former choline chloride joint venture with E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. that was sold in 1997. In addition, in fiscal 2004 the company established a $25 million reserve in connection with matters related to an SEC investigation (see Legal Matters). These items were partially offset by a gain of $21 million recognized upon the sale of the companys cost method investment in a venture. Lower selling costs, marketing related costs and various other legal and insurance costs resulted in a favorable comparison with fiscal 2003. Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, income taxes and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2004 Operating Profit Fiscal 2003 Operating Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Retail Products $ 1,218 $ 1,298 (6 )% Foodservice Products 325 371 (12 )% Food Ingredients 197 125 58 % Meat Processing 99 (100 )% Retail Products operating profit decreased $80 million for fiscal 2004 to $1.2 billion. Included in fiscal 2003 operating profit was $43 million from the divested canned seafood operations. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives decreased operating profit by $25 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of $28 million. The remaining decline in operating profit is reflective of reduced gross profit, due to increased input costs, which were not fully offset by increased selling prices, primarily in refrigerated meat products, an extremely competitive environment in popcorn products and a less favorable mix of products. Foodservice Products operating profit declined $46 million to $325 million. Included in fiscal 2003 operating profit was $6 million from businesses divested in that year. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives decreased operating profit by $29 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of $7 million. Increased gross profits were largely offset by significantly higher SG&A expenses related to information systems implementation costs. Food Ingredients operating profit increased $72 million to $197 million, primarily reflecting improved gross profits, as discussed above. Costs of implementing the companys operational efficiency initiatives decreased operating profit by $8 million. The estimated impact of the inclusion of one extra week in fiscal 2004 was an increase of $7 million. The Meat Processing segment generated operating profit of $99 million in fiscal 2003. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2004, net interest expense was $275 million, unchanged from the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2004, the company closed out all $2.5 billion of its interest rate swap agreements. Of the $2.5 billion interest rate swaps 26 closed out in fiscal 2004, $2.0 billion of the interest rate swaps had been used to effectively convert certain of the companys fixed rate debt into floating rate debt. The remaining $500 million portion of the companys interest rate swaps was used to hedge certain of the companys forecasted interest payments on floating rate debt for the period from 2005 through 2011. For financial statement and tax purposes, the proceeds received upon termination of the interest rate swap agreements will be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. Equity Method Investment Earnings Equity method investment earnings decreased to $44 million in fiscal 2004 from $46 million in fiscal 2003. This reflects decreased earnings from an investment in a South American joint venture, offset by higher profits due to a full year of results of the companys minority ownership in the fresh beef and pork joint venture established following the companys fresh beef and pork divestiture in September 2002. Income from the companys other equity method investments, which includes barley malting, potato processing and grain merchandising, did not substantially change from their fiscal 2003 amounts. Results of Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $97 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, the company recognized a net of tax loss from discontinued operations of $52 million. The year over year change primarily resulted from: a fiscal 2003 pre tax charge of approximately $112 million related to lowering asset values in connection with the then pending chicken business sale, net pre tax income of $51 million recognized on the sales of the chicken business, UAP North America and the Spanish feed business in fiscal 2004, a fiscal 2003 charge of $24 million resulting from the reduction of values of certain refrigerated meat inventory, fiscal 2004 pre tax impairment charges of $27 million recognized to write down the long lived assets of the UAP International and Portuguese poultry operations to net realizable value, and significantly improved gross margins at the chicken business and UAP North America during the six month period of fiscal 2004 prior to the divestitures, relative to those generated in fiscal 2003, due to industry wide improvements in the markets for their products. The companys UAP North America operations had a fiscal year end of February, while the companys consolidated year end is May. Historically, the results of UAP North America have been reflected in the companys consolidated results on a three month lag (e.g., UAP North Americas results for June through August are included in the companys consolidated results for the period September through November). Due to the disposition of UAP North America on November 23, 2003, UAP North Americas results for the three months ending November 23, 2003, a net of tax loss of $24 million, was recorded directly to retained earnings. If this business had not been divested, this net of tax loss would have been recognized in the companys fiscal 2004 consolidated statement of earnings. The comparable amount recorded in income (loss) from discontinued operations for the three month period ended November 24, 2002 was a loss of $20 million. Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 37% for fiscal 2004 and 35% in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004, the company reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with respect to the IRSs examination of the companys tax returns for fiscal years 1996 through 1999. As a result of the resolution of these matters, the company reduced income tax expense by $27 million. This was partially offset by the net tax impact related to the divestiture of certain foreign entities which increased income tax expense by approximately $21 million during fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003, the company divested its fresh beef and pork operations. As a result, the company generated foreign tax credits in excess of the taxable gain generated from the transaction. This resulted in a decrease of approximately 4% in the companys effective tax rate below the statutory tax rate in fiscal 2003. 27 Net income was $811 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in fiscal 2004, compared to $764 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in fiscal 2003. LIQUDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital The companys primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent balance sheet that provides the flexibility to pursue its growth objectives. The company currently uses short term debt to finance increases in its trade working capital (accounts receivable plus inventory, less accounts payable, accrued expenses and advances on sales) needs and a combination of equity and long term debt to finance both its base trade working capital needs and its noncurrent assets. Commercial paper borrowings (usually less than 30 days maturity) are reflected in the companys consolidated balance sheets within notes payable. The company maintains a $1.05 billion revolving credit line as a backup to the companys commercial paper program. The company has never used the revolving credit facility. The company is in compliance with the credit agreements financial covenants. Management believes the company will maintain its current commercial paper rating for the foreseeable future, thus allowing the companys continued issuance of commercial paper. If the company were unable to access the short term commercial paper market, the company could use its bank revolving credit facility to provide liquidity. The companys $1.05 billion revolving credit facility (expiring in May 2007) is with major domestic and international banks. The interest rates for the revolving credit facilities are generally .30 to .35 percentage points higher than the interest rates for commercial paper. The company determined that it did not require the availability of its $400 million accounts receivable securitization program and terminated this program in fiscal 2005. Under this program, accounts receivable could be sold without recourse at a discount, and the cost was included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Because these accounts receivable were sold without recourse to unrelated third parties, accounts receivable balances sold were excluded from the companys consolidated financial statements. As of the end of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 the company had no outstanding accounts receivable sold. The companys overall level of interest bearing debt totaled $4.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2005, compared to $5.7 billion as of the end of fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the company retired $600 million of 7.5% senior debt and $175 million of preferred securities of a subsidiary company in advance of their respective dates of maturity. The company also made scheduled payments of maturing long term debt of $385 million. The company also reduced its notes payable borrowings by $22 million during 2005. As of the end of both fiscal 2005 and 2004, the companys senior debt ratings were BBB+ (Fitch), Baa1 (Moodys) and BBB+ (Standard & Poors), all investment grade ratings. The company also has a shelf registration under which it could issue from time to time up to $4 billion in debt securities. Over the last three fiscal years, the company has divested its major commodity operations, such as fresh beef and pork, cheese processing, canned seafood, chicken processing and agricultural chemical distribution. The company received debt and equity interests as part of the proceeds for certain of those businesses. During fiscal 2005, the company sold its equity interest in the fresh beef and pork venture for $194 million. The company also reached an agreement with affiliates of Swift Foods by which the company took control and ownership of the cattle feeding business (including feedlots and live cattle), and on October 15, 2004, the company sold the feedlots to Smithfield Foods, Inc. for approximately $70 million. The company retained live cattle inventory and related derivative instruments of approximately $255 million and liquidated those assets during fiscal 2005. 28 During fiscal 2005, the company sold substantially all of the remaining assets of UAP International for total proceeds of $43 million. Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company implemented a plan to exit the specialty meats foodservice business. The company closed a manufacturing facility in Alabama, sold its operations in California, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, finalized a sale of its operations in Illinois. Sales proceeds from the California and Illinois facilities were $14 million and $10 million, respectively. In fiscal 2005, the company sold the remaining $35 million of the UAP Preferred Securities and accrued dividends for cash. In December 2004, the company sold 10 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $283 million, recognizing a gain of $186 million. In August 2005 (fiscal 2006), the company sold its remaining 15.4 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock to that company for $482 million. The company will recognize a pre tax gain of approximately $333 million, which will be subject to federal and state income tax, in its first quarter of fiscal 2006. The company continues to evaluate opportunities to sell its $150 million subordinated notes receivable plus accrued interest of $35 million from the fresh beef and pork divestiture (which are reflected at a combined current fair market value of $147 million in the companys balance sheet at May 29, 2005). Cash Flows In fiscal 2005, the company used $401 million of cash, which was the net impact of $1.1 billion generated from operating activities, $301 million generated from investing activities and $1.8 billion used in financing activities. Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $837 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to $706 million generated in fiscal 2004. The increased cash flow was primarily due to a decrease of $470 million in amounts sold under the accounts receivable securitization program in fiscal 2004, partially offset by an increase in working capital in fiscal 2005. Cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was approximately $271 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to cash used of $125 million in fiscal 2004. The increased cash flows from operations of discontinued operations primarily reflect the sale of the inventory of the discontinued cattle feeding business. Cash flow from operating activities is one of the companys primary sources of liquidity. Cash generated from investing activities totaled $301 million for fiscal 2005, versus cash generated from investing activities of $684 million in fiscal 2004. Investing activities for fiscal 2005 include proceeds from the sale of ten million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $282 million, proceeds of $194 million from the sale of the companys remaining interest in Swift Foods, and other proceeds from other asset divestitures, offset by capital expenditures of $453 million. Investing activities for fiscal 2004 consisted primarily of proceeds of approximately $935 million from the divestitures of the chicken business, UAP North America and the Spanish feed business, partially offset by capital expenditures of $349 million. Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.8 billion in fiscal 2005, as compared to cash used of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the company retired $600 million of 7.5% senior debt and $175 million of preferred securities of a subsidiary company in advance of their respective dates of maturity. The company also made scheduled payments of maturing long term debt of $385 million. The company also paid dividends of $550 million 29 and repurchased $181 million of its common stock as part of its share repurchase program. During fiscal 2004, the company repaid debt of $515 million, paid dividends of $537 million and repurchased shares of its outstanding common stock for $419 million. The company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 will be approximately $400 million. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, additional share repurchases and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The company uses off balance sheet arrangements (e.g., operating leases) where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use. The company periodically enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in Obligations and Commitments below. The company has used off balance sheet arrangements in connection with the securitization and sale of trade receivables generated in the ordinary course of business. During fiscal 2005, the company terminated its accounts receivable securitization program. As of the end of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the company did not have any outstanding accounts receivable sold. As a result of adopting FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, the company has consolidated the assets and liabilities of several entities from which it leases property, plant and equipment. The company also deconsolidated ConAgra Capital, L.C., an indirectly controlled subsidiary of the company, resulting in the removal of the preferred securities of subsidiary company of $175 million and the addition of $221 million of long term debt and $46 million in other assets in the companys balance sheet as of May 30, 2004. The company redeemed the preferred securities of ConAgra Capital, L.C. in December 2004. Due to the adoption of FIN 46R, the company reflects in its balance sheet: property, plant and equipment, net of $214 million and $221 million, long term debt of $223 million and $419 million, other noncurrent liabilities of $6 million and $25 million and other assets of $12 million and $46 million, as of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, respectively. The company has no other material obligations arising out of variable interests with unconsolidated entities. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS As part of its ongoing operations, the company enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future payments under contracts such as lease agreements, debt agreements and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as take or pay contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into by the company in its normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available to the company. Of these items, capital lease and debt obligations, which total $4.5 billion, are currently recognized as liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which total $1 billion, are not recognized as liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 30 A summary of the companys contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2005 is as follows (including obligations of discontinued operations): Payments Due by Period (in millions) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long Term Debt $ 4,512.1 $ 117.3 $ 538.3 $ 36.9 $ 3,819.6 Lease Obligations 740.6 103.4 200.5 125.8 310.9 Purchase Obligations 287.7 77.5 132.4 45.6 32.2 Total $ 5,540.4 $ 298.2 $ 871.2 $ 208.3 $ 4,162.7 The companys total obligations of approximately $5.5 billion reflect a decrease of approximately $1.0 billion from the companys 2004 fiscal year end. The decrease was primarily a result of the repayment of certain long term debt during fiscal 2005. The company is also contractually obligated to pay interest on its long term debt obligations. The weighted average interest rate of the long term debt obligations outstanding as of May 29, 2005 was approximately 7.4%. As part of its ongoing operations, the company also enters into arrangements that obligate the company to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in the companys consolidated balance sheet. A summary of the companys commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2005, is as follows (including obligations of discontinued operations): Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period (in millions) Other Commercial Commitments Total Less than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Guarantees $ 57.9 $ 7.9 $ 21.5 $ 10.1 $ 18.4 Other Commitments 5.5 5.1 0.4 Total $ 63.4 $ 13.0 $ 21.9 $ 10.1 $ 18.4 The companys total commitments of approximately $63 million include approximately $38 million in guarantees and other commitments the company has made on behalf of the companys divested fresh beef and pork business. As part of the fresh beef and pork transaction, the company assigned a hog purchase contract to the divested fresh beef and pork business which has indemnified the company for all liabilities under the contract. The company has guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to the hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs. 31 TRADING ACTIVITIES The company accounts for certain contracts (e.g., physical commodity purchase/sale contracts and derivative contracts) at fair value. The company considers a portion of these contracts to be its trading activities; specifically, those contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and its related amendment, SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (collectively SFAS No. 133). The table below summarizes the changes in trading assets and liabilities for fiscal 2005: (in millions) Net asset outstanding as of May 30, 2004, at fair value $ 26.6 Contracts settled during the period 1 (103.7 ) Changes in fair value of contracts outstanding as of May 29, 2005 2 85.4 Changes attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions Net asset outstanding as of May 29, 2005, at fair value $ 8.3 1 Includes contracts outstanding at May 30, 2004, and contracts entered into and settled during fiscal 2005. 2 Includes option premiums paid and received. The following table represents the fair value and scheduled maturity dates of contracts outstanding as of May 29, 2005: Fair Value of Contracts as of May 29, 2005 net asset / (liability) (in millions) Source of Fair Value Maturity less than 1 year Maturity 1 3 years Total Fair Value Prices actively quoted (i.e., exchange traded contracts) $ (0.7 ) $ 5.2 $ 4.5 Prices provided by other external sources (i.e., non exchange traded contracts) 3.8 3.8 Prices based on other valuation models (i.e., non exchange traded contracts) Total fair value $ 3.1 $ 5.2 $ 8.3 In order to minimize the risk of loss associated with non exchange traded transactions with counterparties, the company utilizes established credit limits and performs ongoing counterparty credit evaluations. The above tables exclude commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, including physical contracts to buy or sell commodities at agreed upon fixed prices, as well as derivative contracts (e.g., futures and options) used primarily to hedge an existing asset or liability (e.g., inventory) or an anticipated transaction (e.g., purchase of inventory). The use of such contracts is not considered by the company to be trading activities as these contracts are considered either normal purchase and sale contracts or hedging contracts. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on the companys historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the companys accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require significant or complex 32 judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management of the company. The companys Audit Committee has reviewed the development, selection and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates. Marketing Costs The company incurs certain costs to promote its products through marketing programs which include advertising, retailer incentives and consumer incentives. The company expenses each of these types of marketing costs in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting literature. The judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For volume based incentives provided to retailers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on the companys historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these factors change, managements estimates could change and the company could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled $344 million and $406 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. The company enters into over 150,000 individual marketing programs annually resulting in approximately $3 billion in annual costs. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual marketing programs would not result in a material change in the companys results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes The company recognizes current tax liabilities and assets based on an estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current year for each of the jurisdictions in which the company transacts business. As part of the determination of its current tax liability, management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating positions taken by the company in its tax returns. The company has established reserves for probable tax exposures. These reserves, included in current tax liabilities, represent the companys estimate of amounts expected to be paid, which the company adjusts over time as more information regarding tax audits becomes available. The company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences (e.g., book depreciation versus tax depreciation). If appropriate, the company recognizes valuation allowances to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized, based on the companys assessment of estimated future taxable income, including the consideration of available tax planning strategies. The calculation of current and deferred tax assets (including valuation allowances) and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to the application of complex tax laws, changes in tax laws or related interpretations, uncertainties related to the outcomes of tax audits and changes in the companys operations or other facts and circumstances. Further, management must continually monitor changes in these factors. Changes in such factors may result in changes to management estimates and could require the company to adjust its tax assets and liabilities and record additional income tax expense or benefits. Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third party specialists in order to effectively assess the companys environmental liabilities. Management estimates the companys environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of the company and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. Managements estimate as to its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. The company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change. 33 The company has recognized a reserve of approximately $111 million for environmental liabilities as of May 29, 2005. Historically, the underlying assumptions utilized by the company in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have not differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy. Employment Related Benefits The company incurs certain employment related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits and workers compensation. In order to measure the expense associated with these employment related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to the company. The estimates used by management are based on the companys historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. The company uses third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in the company recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. The company recognized pension expense of $71 million, $76 million and $84 million in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which reflected expected returns on plan assets of $131 million, $127 million and $113 million, respectively. The company contributed $9 million, $66 million and $233 million to the companys pension plans in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The company anticipates contributing $37 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2006. One of the significant assumptions used to account for the companys pension plans is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, the company considers long term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plans investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the company selected 7.75% for the long term rate of return on plan assets for determining its fiscal 2005 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the companys expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for the companys pension plans by approximately $4 million. The company selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2006. When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans, the company uses a market related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and expected return) over five years. As of May 29, 2005, the amount of unrecognized losses in company pension plans was $213 million. These unrecognized losses included unrecognized losses on plan assets of $127 million and other unrecognized actuarial losses of $86 million. The amount of net unrecognized losses will change each year as the actual return on plan assets varies from the expected rate of return and as other factors vary from actuarial assumptions used to estimate the expense. Assuming no further change in the unrecognized losses in future periods, these losses would be recognized in future years resulting in an increase in pension expense of $9 million in fiscal 2006. Another significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. The company selects a discount rate each year for its plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year by year, projected benefit cash flows for the companys pension plans. The hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moodys Aa) available at the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount rates selected by the company for determination of pension expense for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 6.0%, 6.5% and 7.25%, respectively. The company selected a discount rate of 5.75% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2006. This 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate is expected to increase pension expense by $9 million but to result in no incremental company contributions to the pension plans in fiscal 2006. A 25 basis point increase in the companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would decrease pension expense for the companys pension plans by 34 $3 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in the companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would increase pension expense for the companys pension plans by $7 million for the year. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately $9 million for fiscal 2006. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately $9 million for fiscal 2006. For its year end pension obligation determination, the company selected 5.75% and 6.0% for fiscal year 2005 and 2004, respectively. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. The company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. Based on this information, the company selected 4.5% for fiscal 2005 and 2004 as the rate of compensation increase for determining its year end pension obligation. The company selected 4.5% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2005. A 25 basis point increase in the companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would increase pension expense for the companys pension plans by approximately $3 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in the companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2005 would decrease pension expense for the companys pension plans by approximately $2 million for the year. The company selected a rate of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2006. The 25 basis point decrease in the fiscal 2006 rate of compensation increase as compared to the fiscal 2005 rate is expected to decrease pension expense by $2 million in fiscal 2006. The company also provides certain postretirement health care benefits. The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on the companys assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate selected by the company for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 6.0%, 6.5% and 7.25%, respectively. The company has selected a discount rate of 5.5% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2006. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2006 would decrease/increase postretirement expense for the companys plans by $1 million. The company has assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 10%, with the trend rate decreasing to 5% by 2011. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect: ($ in millions) One Percent Increase One Percent Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost $ 2.7 $ (2.8 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 32.7 (29.2 ) The company provides workers compensation benefits to its employees. The measurement of the liability for the companys cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption made by the company is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of its obligation. The discount rate used at May 29, 2005 was 5.5%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense. Impairment of Long Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets The company reduces the carrying amounts of long lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company in such 35 areas as future economic conditions, industry specific conditions, product pricing and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. The company utilizes a relief from royalty methodology in evaluating impairment of its brands/trademarks. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. As the calculated fair value of the companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R will require the company to measure the cost of all employee stock based compensation awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards and to record that cost as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award (generally over the vesting period of the award). Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have an impact on the companys results of operations, although it will have no impact on the companys overall financial position. SFAS No. 123R is effective beginning in the companys first quarter of fiscal 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the companys consolidated results of operations and cash flows. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Inventory Pricing, for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage), requiring that those items be recognized as current period expenses. This statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The statement is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in the companys fiscal 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29, eliminating the exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets, and replaces it with a general exception to fair value accounting for nonmonetary exchanges that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. The statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. Management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS ConAgra Foods enters into many lease agreements for land, buildings and equipment at competitive market rates, and some of the lease arrangements are with Opus Corporation or its affiliates. A director of ConAgra Foods is a beneficial owner, officer and director of Opus Corporation. The agreements relate to the leasing of land and buildings for ConAgra Foods. ConAgra Foods occupies the buildings pursuant to long term leases with Opus Corporation and its affiliates, some of which contain various termination rights and purchase options. Leases effective in fiscal 2005 required annual lease payments by ConAgra Foods of $19.8 million. As a result of adopting FIN 46R, the company has consolidated certain of the Opus affiliates from which it leases property, plant and equipment. These leases were previously accounted for as operating leases. Opus Corporation or its affiliates were paid $52.9 million for construction work during fiscal 2005 on properties leased by ConAgra Foods from third parties. Opus Corporation had revenues in 36 excess of $1.25 billion in 2004.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting the company are exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates and foreign currencies. These fluctuations impact raw material costs of all reporting segments, as well as the companys trading activities. Commodities The company purchases commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, sugar, energy and packaging materials to be used in its operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create gross margin risk. The company enters into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. ConAgra Foods has policies governing the hedging instruments its businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of its businesses. The company also monitors the amount of associated counter party credit risk for all non exchange traded transactions. In addition, the company purchases and sells certain commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats and energy, in its trading operations. The companys trading activities are limited in terms of maximum dollar exposure, as measured by a dollar at risk methodology and monitored to ensure compliance. The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. In practice, as markets move, the company actively manages its risk and adjusts hedging strategies as appropriate. Fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on the companys net derivative position by commodity at each quarter end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying commodity positions that are being hedged. The commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument. 37 Effect of 10% change in market prices: (in millions) 2005 2004 Processing Activities Grains High $ 16.3 $ 18.3 Low 9.5 2.1 Average 12.3 11.3 Meats High 22.8 1.0 Low 0.3 Average 7.2 0.6 Energy High 32.3 9.7 Low 18.6 Average 24.8 3.9 Trading Activities Grains High 22.6 35.7 Low 14.8 21.0 Average 17.5 28.9 Meats High 16.3 3.0 Low 0.9 1.5 Average 5.4 2.2 Energy High 80.9 7.5 Low Average 20.8 1.9 Interest Rates The company may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of debt. At the end of fiscal 2005 and 2004, the company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding, as all of the companys interest rate swap agreements were terminated in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. As of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt was estimated at $5.2 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively, based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of May 29, 2005 and May 30, 2004, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt by approximately $344 million and $336 million, respectively, while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the companys fixed rate debt by approximately $394 million and $387 million, respectively. With respect to floating rate debt, a one percentage point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the companys reported interest expense. Foreign Operations In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the company may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of its processing and trading operations. This activity primarily relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory, capital equipment, sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis for the companys processing and trading operations. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in exchange rates. Actual changes in exchange rates may differ from 38 hypothetical changes. Fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was based on the companys net foreign currency position at each quarter end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying foreign denominated transactions that are being hedged. The currencies hedged have a high inverse correlation to exchange rate changes of the foreign currency derivative instrument.
