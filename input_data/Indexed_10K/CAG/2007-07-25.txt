ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to the Companys financial performance and condition. The discussion should be read together with the Companys financial statements and related notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Results for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2007 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future. Executive Overview ConAgra Foods, Inc. (NYSE: CAG) is one of North Americas leading packaged food companies, serving grocery retailers, as well as restaurants and other foodservice establishments. Popular ConAgra Foods consumer brands include: Banquet&reg;, Chef Boyardee&reg;, Egg Beaters&reg;, Healthy Choice&reg;, Hebrew National&reg;, Hunts&reg;, Marie Callenders&reg;, Orville Redenbachers&reg;, Reddi wip&reg;, PAM&reg;, and many others. Fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share were $1.51, including $1.35 per diluted share of income from continuing operations and income of $0.16 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Fiscal 2006 diluted earnings per share were $1.03, including income from continuing operations of $1.13 per diluted share, and loss from discontinued operations of $0.10 per diluted share. Several items affect the comparability of results of continuing operations, as discussed in Other Significant Items of NoteItems Impacting Comparability, below. Operating Initiatives ConAgra Foods is implementing operational improvement initiatives that are intended to generate profitable sales growth, improve profit margins, and expand returns on capital over time. Recent developments in the Companys strategies and action plans include: Increased and more focused marketing and innovation investments: The Company is continuing its new strategy for allocating its marketing resources. Investment is concentrated behind the brands with the most significant opportunities and more appropriate go to market strategies for all brands are being implemented. The Companys innovation investments in fiscal 2007 resulted in the development of a variety of new products. Healthy Choice&reg; Caf&eacute; Steamers, Healthy Choice&reg; Paninis, new flavors of Healthy Choice&reg; Soups, Hunts&reg; Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes, Orville Redenbachers&reg; Smart Pop! Low Sodium, Orville Redenbachers&reg; Naturals, Swiss Miss&reg; Pudding Mousse Delights, Chef Boyardee&reg; Mac & Cheese, PAM&reg; Professional, and Fleischmanns&reg; and Parkay&reg; Soft Spreads have been introduced or are expected to be introduced to the market in early fiscal 2008. These new products, along with additional new products planned for the balance of fiscal 2008 and beyond, are expected to support future sales growth and market expansion. The Company expects to increase marketing investment related to its innovation and sales growth initiatives (discussed below) in fiscal 2008. Sales growth initiatives: The Company is continuing to implement sales improvement initiatives focused on penetrating the fastest growing channels, better return on customer trade arrangements, and optimal shelf placement for the Companys most profitable products. These, along with the marketing initiatives, are intended to generate profitable sales growth. Reducing costs throughout the supply chain and the general and administrative functions: For more than a year, the Company has been implementing the fiscal 2006 2008 restructuring plan. The Company has implemented several initiatives to streamline its supply chain through procurement initiatives, manufacturing process improvements, plant rationalization, and changes to its distribution network. The Company has also reduced its salaried workforce by several hundred employees over the past two years and implemented other initiatives that are designed to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses. 16 Table of Contents Portfolio changes: The Company has divested non core operations that have limited the Companys ability to achieve its efficiency targets. During fiscal 2006, the Company identified several operations as non core, including Cooks Ham, seafood, packaged meats, packaged cheese, oat milling, and refrigerated pizza. During fiscal 2006, the Company completed the divestitures of its Cooks Ham and seafood operations. During the first half of fiscal 2007, the Company completed the divestitures of its packaged meats business, packaged cheese business, oat milling business, and the refrigerated pizza business. Divesting these operations have helped simplify the Companys operations and are expected to enhance efficiency initiatives going forward. Discontinued Operations. The results of operations for Cooks Ham, seafood, packaged meats, packaged cheese, as well as for UAP North America, UAP International, the Spanish feed business, Portuguese poultry business, and specialty meats foodservice business, are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning September 24, 2004, the results of operations of the divested cattle feeding business are presented in discontinued operations. Capital Allocation During fiscal 2006 and 2007, the Company used cash generated from investing activities (such as non core asset dispositions and proceeds generated from the sales of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock and the Swift Note) to fund the following capital deployment actions: the repayment of $946 million of debt, the repurchase of approximately $812 million (approximately 32.9 million shares) of common stock (with approximately $88 million of share repurchases remaining authorized at May 27, 2007), the payment of $367 million and $565 million of dividends in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, the contribution of approximately $208 million to pension plans, and the payment of approximately $90 million of debt premium to effect the exchange of approximately $200 million principal amount of 9.75% subordinated notes due 2021 and approximately $300 million principal amount of 6.75% senior notes due 2011 for approximately $500 million principal amount of 5.82% senior notes due 2017. The Company continues to assess its allocation of capital and periodically reviews the appropriateness and timing of share repurchases and the continuation of the share repurchase program. Other Significant Items of Note Items Impacting Comparability As the Company continues operating improvement initiatives, it incurs costs related to changes that are intended to make a more efficient cost structure, for example: reducing headcount and closing facilities. The Company also incurs costs to dispose of businesses, write down assets, retire debt, and resolve legal disputes, and in connection with other items that impact the comparability of operating results. The Company has incurred cumulative pretax restructuring costs of $233 million, $103 million of which were incurred in fiscal 2007 and $130 million of which were incurred in fiscal 2006. The Company estimates total pretax restructuring charges of $257 million through fiscal 2008. As a result of these restructuring plans, the Company achieved cost savings of approximately $85 to $90 million in fiscal 2007 and expects significant cost savings and cost avoidance in future years. On February 14, 2007, the Company initiated a voluntary recall of all varieties of peanut butter manufactured at its Sylvester, Georgia plant. The costs of the recall negatively impacted net sales, gross margin, and operating profit in the Consumer Foods and International Foods segments for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007, as discussed below. 17 Table of Contents Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2007 include: Reported within Continuing Operations charges totaling $103 million, $64 million after tax, for restructuring related to programs designed to reduce the Companys ongoing operating costs, charges totaling $66 million, $41 million after tax, related to the peanut butter recall, charges of $21 million, $14 million after tax, related to additional compensation expense from expensing stock options, due to the Companys adoption of SFAS No. 123R, gains of approximately $21 million, $13 million after tax, related to the divestiture of an oat milling business and other non core assets, a gain of approximately $8 million, $5 million after tax, resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire at a production facility in fiscal 2005, a gain of approximately $5 million, $3 million after tax, resulting from a legal settlement, a benefit of approximately $7 million, $5 million after tax, resulting from a favorable resolution of franchise tax matters, net tax charges of approximately $6 million related to unfavorable settlements and changes in estimates, and a gain of approximately $4 million resulting from the sale of an equity investment in a malt venture, and related income tax benefits of approximately $4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of approximately $8 million. Reported within Discontinued Operations charges of approximately $21 million, $12 million after tax, related to an additional impairment charge based on final negotiations related to the sale of the packaged meats operations, gains of approximately $64 million, $37 million after tax, from the divestiture of the packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business, and benefits of $17 million, $11 million after tax, related to a postretirement curtailment gain and a legal settlement associated with the divestiture of the packaged meats operations. Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2006 include: Reported within Continuing Operations a gain of approximately $329 million, $209 million after tax, from the sale of 15.4 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock in August 2005, charges totaling $130 million, $81 million after tax, for restructuring charges related to programs designed to reduce the Companys ongoing operating costs, impairment charges totaling $83 million, $51 million after tax, related to a note receivable from Swift Foods, Inc. received in connection with the Companys fiscal 2003 divestiture of its fresh beef and pork business, impairment charges totaling $76 million, $73 million after tax, related to two equity method investments, charges totaling $30 million, $19 million after tax, related to the early retirement of debt, a charge of $19 million, $12 million after tax, related to accelerated recognition of benefits in connection with the departure of key executives, 18 Table of Contents a charge of $17 million, $11 million after tax, reflecting the adjustment of a litigation reserve, a charge of $6 million, $4 million after tax, related to a plant closure in the Companys International Foods segment, and a favorable effective tax rate of 34%, versus the Companys expected effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 of 36%, principally resulting from the implementation of state tax planning strategies and changes in estimates of state tax rates, and foreign and other tax credits, partially offset by the absence of income tax benefits for the impairments of equity method investments (noted above). Reported within Discontinued Operations charges of approximately $241 million, $209 million after tax, primarily related to a goodwill impairment charge, and gains of approximately $116 million, $37 million after tax, from the divestiture of businesses. Opportunities and Challenges The Company believes that its operating initiatives will favorably impact future sales, profits, profit margins, and returns on capital. Because of the scope of change underway, there is risk that these broad change initiatives will not be successfully implemented. Competitive pressures, input costs, and the ability to execute the operational changes, among other factors, will affect the timing and impact of these initiatives. The Company has faced increased costs for many of its significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. Inflationary pressures negatively impacted fiscal 2006 results, but had less of an impact in fiscal 2005. The Companys productivity and pricing initiatives in fiscal 2007 effectively mitigated the impact of inflation. However, the Company expects inflation in fiscal 2008 to exceed recent levels. When appropriate, the Company uses long term purchase contracts, futures, and options to reduce the volatility of certain raw materials costs. Changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of the Companys products. The Company offers a variety of food products which appeal to a range of consumer preferences and utilizes innovation and marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing consumer trends. As part of these programs, the Company introduces new products and product extensions. Consolidation of many of the Companys customers continues to result in increased buying power, negotiating strength, and complex service requirements for those customers. This trend, which is expected to continue, may negatively impact gross margins, particularly in the Consumer Foods segment. In order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation, the Company is continually evaluating its go to market strategies and its customer service costs. The Company is implementing improved trade promotion programs to drive improved return on investment, and is pursuing shelf placement and customer service improvement initiatives. SEGMENT REVIEW The Company reports its operations in four reporting segments: Consumer Foods, Food and Ingredients, Trading and Merchandising, and International Foods. Consumer Foods The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded, private label, and customized food products which are sold in various retail and foodservice channels. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf stable temperature classes. 19 Table of Contents Food and Ingredients The Food and Ingredients reporting segment includes commercially branded foods and ingredients, which are sold principally to foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segments primary products include specialty potato products, milled grain ingredients, dehydrated vegetables and seasonings, blends, and flavors. Trading and Merchandising The Trading and Merchandising reporting segment includes the sourcing, merchandising, trading, marketing, and distribution of agricultural and energy commodities. International Foods The International Foods reporting segment includes branded food products which are sold in retail channels principally in North America, Europe, and Asia. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf stable temperature classes. 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2007Net Sales Fiscal 2006Net Sales % Increase/ (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 6,485 $ 6,504 % Food and Ingredients 3,482 3,189 9 % Trading and Merchandising 1,455 1,186 23 % International Foods 606 603 % Total $ 12,028 $ 11,482 5 % Overall, Company net sales increased $546 million to $12.0 billion in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting favorable results in the Food and Ingredients and Trading and Merchandising segments. Increased net sales at the Food and Ingredients segment were primarily the result of price and volume increases. Increased net sales in the Trading and Merchandising segment were primarily driven by successfully capitalizing on conditions in the fertilizer and crude oil markets. The Consumer Foods and International Foods segments were relatively flat compared to prior year. The peanut butter recall had a negative impact on the Companys fiscal year net sales for the Consumer Foods and International Foods reporting segments. The recall is expected to continue to have a negative impact on the Companys sales for the first half of fiscal 2008. Sales of peanut butter in fiscal 2007 were $92 million, as compared to $147 million in fiscal 2006. Consumer Foods net sales decreased $19 million for the year to $6.5 billion. Sales volume declined by 1% in fiscal 2007. Results reflect the effect of price increases and sales growth in certain of the Companys priority investment brands, offset by the impact of the peanut butter recall, declines in sales of low margin foodservice and private label items, the divestiture of a refrigerated pizza business during the first half of fiscal 2007, and continued SKU rationalization efforts. Net sales of the Companys priority investment brands, which represented approximately 75% of total segment sales during fiscal 2007, increased 1% as a group. Sales growth for some of the Companys most significant brands, including Chef Boyardee&reg;, Egg Beaters&reg;, Hebrew National&reg;, Hunts&reg;, Kid Cuisine&reg;, Orville Redenbachers&reg;, PAM&reg;, Slim Jim&reg;, Snack Pack&reg;, Reddi Wip&reg;, Manwich&reg;, Swiss Miss&reg;, and Davids&reg;, was largely offset by sales declines for the year for Banquet&reg;, Healthy Choice&reg;, Act II&reg;, LaChoy&reg;, Pemmican&reg;, The Max&reg;, and Peter Pan&reg;. Peanut butter net sales declined by $55 million from the prior year due to the peanut butter recall. 20 Table of Contents Food and Ingredients net sales increased $293 million to $3.5 billion, primarily reflecting price and volume increases for potato and dehydrated vegetable operations, as well as price increases in the wheat milling operations resulting from higher year over year grain prices. Trading and Merchandising net sales increased $269 million to $1.5 billion. Increased net sales reflect more profitable trading and merchandising of agricultural products, primarily in corn and fertilizer, principally due to increased worldwide demand. Increased net sales also reflect more profitable margins from trading of crude oil. These increases were partially offset by lower margins from trading of natural gas and lower grain and edible bean merchandising volume resulting from the divestment or closure of various locations. International Foods net sales increased $3 million to $606 million. The strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for a $6 million increase. Growth of the priority investment brands, primarily in Canada and Mexico, was offset by sales declines related to the discontinuance of a number of low margin products and the effect of the peanut butter recall. Gross Profit (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2007Gross Profit Fiscal 2006Gross Profit % Increase Consumer Foods $ 1,920 $ 1,842 4 % Food and Ingredients 599 538 11 % Trading and Merchandising 441 278 59 % International Foods 179 165 8 % Total $ 3,139 $ 2,823 11 % The Companys gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $3.1 billion, an increase of $316 million, or 11%, from the prior year. Costs of implementing the Companys restructuring plans reduced gross profit by $46 million and $20 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. The increase in gross profit was largely driven by results in the Trading and Merchandising segment, reflecting higher margins in energy trading, as well as profitable trading and merchandising of fertilizer. Fiscal 2007 results include the impact of approximately $30 million due to the peanut butter recall, reflected as a reduction of net sales of $19 million, and an increase of $11 million in cost of goods sold. Consumer Foods gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $1.9 billion, an increase of $78 million from fiscal 2006. Costs of implementing the Companys restructuring plans reduced gross profit by $45 million and $20 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Also included in fiscal 2007 gross profit is the impact of approximately $29 million due to the peanut butter recall. The increase in gross profit for fiscal 2007 was largely driven by supply chain cost improvements and improved product mix, partially offset by the effects of inflation, the peanut butter recall, and restructuring costs, as discussed above. Food and Ingredients gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $599 million, an increase of $61 million over the prior year. Costs of implementing the Companys restructuring plans reduced gross profit for fiscal 2007 by $1 million. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increase in net sales, discussed above, partially offset by the divestiture of an oat milling business in the first half of fiscal 2007. Trading and Merchandising gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $441 million, an increase of $163 million over the prior year. Increased gross profit was the result of the net sales increase in the trading and merchandising of fertilizer and more profitable margins from trading of crude oil. The segment benefited from significant volatility in the energy markets as well as increasing prices for fertilizer due to increased worldwide demand. Management does not expect similar performance in fiscal 2008. 21 Table of Contents International Foods gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $179 million, an increase of $14 million over the prior fiscal year. The increase included $2 million resulting from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in gross profit also reflected the increases in net sales, as discussed above, favorable product mix and reductions in supply chain costs. Gross profit was reduced by approximately $1 million due to the peanut butter recall. Gross Margin Reporting Segment Fiscal 2007Gross Margin Fiscal 2006Gross Margin Consumer Foods 30 % 28 % Food and Ingredients 17 % 17 % Trading and Merchandising 30 % 23 % International Foods 30 % 27 % Total Company (continuing operations) 26 % 25 % The Companys gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for fiscal 2007 was up one percentage point compared to fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting the impact of productivity improvements in the Consumer Foods and Food and Ingredients segments and improved profitability in the Trading and Merchandising markets. The impact of these productivity improvements was somewhat offset by reduced margins due to the effects of inflation, the Companys restructuring charges, and the peanut butter recall. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $1.9 billion for fiscal 2007, a decrease of $28 million from the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 reflect: increased advertising and promotion expense by $117 million, increased management incentive expenses by $112 million, charges of $57 million related to the execution of the Companys restructuring plan, $23 million of income, net of direct pass through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses, charges related to the peanut butter recall of $36 million, decreased selling and marketing expense by $36 million, gains of $27 million related to the disposition of an oat milling business, certain international licensing rights for a small brand, and four corporate aircraft, charges of $21 million related to expensing of stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, decreased professional fees by $25 million, increased cash charitable donations by $16 million, partially offset by decreased product charitable donations by $8 million, a benefit of $13 million for favorable legal settlements, and a benefit of $7 million related to a favorable resolution of franchise tax matters. Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 are the following items: charges of $109 million related to the Companys restructuring plan, charges of $83 million on the Swift & Company note impairment, 22 Table of Contents charges of $30 million on the early retirement of debt, a charge of $19 million for severance of key executives (including a charge of approximately $11 million related to incentive compensation plans), a charge of $17 million for patent related litigation expense, and a charge of $6 million for the impairment of an international manufacturing facility. Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, gain on the sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2007Operating Profit Fiscal 2006Operating Profit % Increase Consumer Foods $ 848 $ 828 2 % Food and Ingredients 439 364 21 % Trading and Merchandising 317 189 68 % International Foods 63 62 2 % Consumer Foods operating profit increased $20 million for the fiscal year to $848 million. The increase for the fiscal year is reflective of the increased gross profit, discussed above, and was influenced by a number of factors, including: restructuring costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses of $39 million and $64 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, costs of the peanut butter recall related to selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $35 million, increased advertising and promotion costs by approximately $93 million, increased incentive costs by approximately $42 million, lower selling and marketing expenses by $38 million, and reimbursement income of approximately $23 million, net of direct pass through costs, related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses. Food and Ingredients operating profit increased $75 million to $439 million in fiscal 2007. Operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved gross margins, as discussed above. Other factors affecting the operating profit change over fiscal 2006 included: lower selling, general and administrative expenses related to the implementation of the Companys restructuring plan by $6 million versus fiscal 2006; gains recorded in fiscal 2007 of $18 million related to the Companys sale of an oat milling business and $8 million resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire; and increased incentive and selling expenses versus 2006. Trading and Merchandising operating profit increased $128 million to $317 million in fiscal 2007, resulting from the increased gross profit, as discussed above, somewhat offset by higher incentive costs versus 2006. International Foods operating profit increased $1 million to $63 million in fiscal 2007. Operating profit included the increase in gross profit, as discussed above, as well as a gain of approximately $4 million related to the sale of certain international licensing rights for a small brand. These gains were substantially offset by increased advertising and promotion, and selling and marketing expenses, principally due to the expansion of global markets. Fiscal 2006 operating profit was reduced by $6 million in connection with the closure of a production facility in Canada. 23 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2007, net interest expense was $226 million, a decrease of $46 million, or 17%, over the prior fiscal year. Decreased interest expense reflects the Companys retirement of nearly $900 million of debt during fiscal 2006, as well as the Companys retirement of nearly $47 million of debt during fiscal 2007. These factors were partially offset by a reduced benefit from the interest rate swap agreements terminated in fiscal 2004. The benefit associated with the termination of the interest rate swap agreements continues to be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. As a result, the Companys net interest expense was reduced by $4 million during fiscal 2007 and $12 million during fiscal 2006. Management expects net interest expense to be higher in fiscal 2008 due to lower interest income from cash and cash equivalents. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company completed an exchange of approximately $200 million principal amount of its 9.75% subordinated notes due 2021 and $300 million principal amount of its 6.75% senior notes due 2011 for approximately $500 million principal amount of 5.82% senior notes due 2017 and cash of approximately $90 million. The Company is amortizing the $90 million cash payment over the life of the new notes within net interest expense. Gain on Sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation Common Stock During fiscal 2006, the Company sold its remaining 15.4 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $482 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $329 million. Equity Method Investment Earnings (Loss) During fiscal 2005, the Company determined that the carrying values of its investments in two unrelated equity method investments, a bio fuels venture and a malt venture, were other than temporarily impaired and therefore recognized pre tax impairment charges totaling $71 million ($66 million after tax). During fiscal 2006, the Company recognized additional impairment charges totaling $76 million ($73 million after tax) of its investments in the malt venture and an unrelated investment in a foreign prepared foods business, due to further declines in the estimated proceeds from the disposition of these investments. The investment in the foreign prepared foods business was disposed of in fiscal 2006. The extent of the impairments was determined based upon the Companys assessment of the recoverability of its investments based primarily upon the expected proceeds of planned dispositions of the investments. During fiscal 2007, the Company completed the disposition of the equity method investment in the malt venture for proceeds of approximately $24 million, including notes and other receivables totaling approximately $7 million. This transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $4 million, with a related tax benefit of approximately $4 million. The Companys share of earnings from the Companys remaining equity method investments, which include potato processing and grain merchandising businesses, increased by approximately $14 million from the comparable amount in fiscal 2006, driven by improved yields in the potato processing business. Results of Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $81 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2007. Included in these amounts are: impairment charges of $21 million in fiscal 2007, based on the final negotiations related to the sale of the packaged meats operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, 24 Table of Contents pre tax earnings of $93 million from operations of discontinued businesses, including a pre tax curtailment gain of $9 million related to postretirement benefits and an $8 million gain related to a legal settlement in connection with the packaged meats operations, a gain of $64 million primarily from the disposition of the Companys packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business in fiscal 2007, and income tax expense of $55 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, the Company recognized a loss from discontinued operations of $55 million, net of tax. Included in these amounts are: impairment charges of $241 million to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale from the Companys discontinued packaged meats business to their estimated fair value less costs to sell, a gain on the disposition of the Companys Cooks Ham business of $110 million, pre tax earnings of $180 million from operations of discontinued businesses in fiscal 2006, and income tax expense of $110 million in fiscal 2006. Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 35% for fiscal 2007. In 2007, state income taxes included approximately $24 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to state tax jurisdictions. This was offset by the tax impact of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit settlement. The effective tax rate was 34% in fiscal 2006. In 2006, state income taxes included approximately $26 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to state tax jurisdictions. This was largely offset by the tax impact of impairments of equity method investments for which the Company does not expect to receive a significant tax benefit. The Company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal 2008, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately 35%. Net income was $765 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007, compared to $534 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. Certain Legal Matters On June 22, 2001, the Company filed an amended annual report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2000. The filing included restated financial information for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. The restatement, due to accounting and conduct matters at United Agri Products, Inc. (UAP), a former subsidiary, was based upon an investigation undertaken by the Company and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. The restatement was principally related to revenue recognition for deferred delivery sales and vendor rebates, advance vendor rebates, and bad debt reserves. The SEC issued a formal order of nonpublic investigation dated September 28, 2001. The Company cooperated with the SEC investigation, which related to the UAP matters described above, as well as other aspects of the Companys financial statements, including the level and application of certain of the Companys reserves. On April 29, 2005, the Company filed an amended annual report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended May 30, 2004 and amended quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for the quarters ended August 29, 2004 and November 28, 2004 (the April 2005 restatement). The filings included restated financial information for fiscal 25 Table of Contents years 2002, 2003, 2004, and the first two quarters of fiscal 2005. The restatement related to tax matters. The Company provided information to the SEC Staff relating to the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement. On July 28, 2006, the Company filed an amendment to its annual report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2005. The filing amended Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Exhibit 12, Computation of Ratios of Earnings to Fixed Charges, for fiscal year 2001, and certain restated financial information for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, all related to the application of certain of the Companys reserves for the three years and fiscal year 1999 income tax expense. The Company provided information to the SEC Staff relating to the facts and circumstances surrounding the amended filing. The Company reached an agreement with the SEC Staff concerning matters associated with these amended filings. That proposed settlement was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 17, 2007. On July 24, 2007, the SEC filed its Complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, followed by an executed Consent, which without the Company admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, reflects the terms of the settlement, including payment by the Company of a civil penalty of $45 million and the Companys agreement to be permanently enjoined from violating certain provisions of the federal securities laws. Additionally, the Company made approximately $2 million in indemnity payments on behalf of former employees concluding separate settlements with the SEC. The Company recorded charges of $25 million in fiscal 2004, $21.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, and $1.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 in connection with the expected settlement of these matters. Three purported class actions were filed in United States District Court for Nebraska, Rantala v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 805CV349, and Bright v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 805CV348 on July 18, 2005, and Boyd v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. al., Case No. 805CV386 on August 8, 2005. The lawsuits are against the Company, its directors and its employee benefits committee on behalf of participants in the Companys employee retirement income savings plans. The lawsuits allege violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in connection with the events resulting in the Companys April 2005 restatement of its financial statements and related matters. The Company has reached a settlement with the plaintiffs in these actions subject to court approval. The settlement includes a $4 million payment, most of which will be paid by an insurer. The Company has also agreed to make certain prospective changes to its benefit plans as part of the settlement. 2006 vs. 2005 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2006Net Sales Fiscal 2005Net Sales % Increase/ (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 6,504 $ 6,598 (1 )% Food and Ingredients 3,189 2,986 7 % Trading and Merchandising 1,186 1,224 (3 )% International Foods 603 576 5 % Total $ 11,482 $ 11,384 1 % Overall, Company net sales increased $98 million to $11.5 billion in fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting favorable results in the Food and Ingredients and International Foods segments. Price increases driven by higher input costs for potatoes, wheat milling and dehydrated vegetables within the Food and Ingredients segment, coupled with the strength of foreign currencies within the International Foods segment enhanced net sales. These increases were partially offset by volume declines in the Consumer Foods segment, principally related to certain shelf stable brands and declines in the Trading and Merchandising segment related to decreased volumes and certain divestitures and closures. 26 Table of Contents Consumer Foods net sales decreased $94 million for the year to $6.5 billion. Sales volume declined by 1% in fiscal 2006, principally due to declines in certain shelf stable brands. Sales of the Companys top thirty brands, which represented approximately 83% of total segment sales during fiscal 2006, were flat as a group, as sales of some of the Companys most significant brands, including Chef Boyardee&reg;, Marie Callenders&reg;, Orville Redenbachers&reg;, Slim Jim&reg;, Hebrew National&reg;, Kid Cuisine&reg;, Reddi Wip&reg;, VanCamp&reg;, Libbys&reg;, LaChoy&reg;, The Max&reg;, Manwich&reg;, Davids&reg;, Ro*Tel&reg;, Angela Mia&reg;, and Mama Rosa&reg; grew in fiscal 2006, but were largely offset by sales declines for the year for Hunts&reg;, Wesson&reg;, Act II&reg;, Snack Pack&reg;, Swiss Miss&reg;, PAM&reg;, Egg Beaters&reg;, Blue Bonnet&reg;, Parkay&reg;, and Rosarita&reg;. Food and Ingredients net sales increased $203 million to $3.2 billion, primarily reflecting price increases driven by higher input costs for potato, wheat milling, and dehydrated vegetable operations. Net sales were also impacted, to a lesser degree, by a 4% increase in potato products volume compared to the prior year. Trading and Merchandising net sales decreased $38 million to $1.2 billion. The decrease resulted principally from lower grain and edible bean merchandising volume resulting from the divestment or closure of various locations. International Foods net sales increased $27 million to $603 million. The strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for $24 million of the increase. Overall volume growth was modest as the 10% volume growth from the top six International brands (Orville Redenbachers&reg;, Act II&reg;, Snack Pack&reg;, Chef Boyardee&reg;, Hunts&reg;, and PAM&reg;), which account for 55% of total segment sales, was offset by sales declines related to the discontinuance of a number of low margin products. Gross Profit (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2006Gross Profit Fiscal 2005Gross Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 1,842 $ 1,890 (3 )% Food and Ingredients 538 512 5 % Trading and Merchandising 278 282 (1 )% International Foods 165 150 10 % Total $ 2,823 $ 2,834 % The Companys gross profit for fiscal 2006 was $2.8 billion, a decrease of $11 million from the prior year, as improvements in the Foods and Ingredients and International Foods segments were more than offset by declines in the Consumer Foods and Trading and Merchandising segments. Gross profit includes $20 million of costs associated with the Companys restructuring plans in fiscal 2006, and $17 million of costs incurred to implement the Companys operational efficiency initiatives in fiscal 2005. Consumer Foods gross profit for fiscal 2006 was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $48 million from fiscal 2005, driven principally by a 2% decline in sales volumes. Fiscal 2006 gross profit includes $20 million of costs related to the Companys restructuring plan, and fiscal 2005 gross profit includes $16 million of costs related to implementing the Companys operational efficiency initiatives. Gross profit was negatively impacted by increased costs of fuel and energy, transportation and warehousing, steel, and other packaging materials in both fiscal 2006 and 2005. Food and Ingredients gross profit for fiscal 2006 was $538 million, an increase of $26 million over the prior year. The gross profit improvement was driven almost entirely by the vegetable processing and dehydration businesses (including potatoes, garlic, onions, and chili peppers) as a result of higher volume (both domestic and export), increased value added sales mix and pricing improvements partially offset by higher raw product and conversion costs. 27 Table of Contents Trading and Merchandising gross profit for fiscal 2006 was $278 million, a decrease of $4 million over the prior year. Gross profit declined $22 million in the trading businesses driven almost entirely by a difficult fertilizer market. Gross profit for the agricultural businesses increased $18 million driven by stronger trading gains in livestock and stronger margins in merchandising grain and animal by products. International Foods gross profit for fiscal 2006 was $165 million, an increase of $15 million over the prior fiscal year. The increase was driven by the impact of stronger foreign currencies and improvements in pricing, product mix management and cost reduction initiatives. Gross Margin Reporting Segment Fiscal 2006Gross Margin Fiscal 2005Gross Margin Consumer Foods 28 % 29 % Food and Ingredients 17 % 17 % Trading and Merchandising 23 % 23 % International Foods 27 % 26 % Total Company 25 % 25 % The Companys gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) for fiscal 2006 was flat compared to fiscal 2005, which reflects the costs incurred to implement the Companys restructuring plan, coupled with lower volumes and fewer opportunities in the energy markets. These effects were offset by a favorable commodity trading environment within the Trading and Merchandising agricultural markets as well as improvements due to pricing and favorable foreign currency impacts within the International Foods segment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $1.9 billion for fiscal 2006, an increase of $218 million over the prior fiscal year. Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 are the following items: charges of $109 million related to the Companys restructuring plan, charges of $83 million on the Swift & Company note impairment, charges of $30 million on the early retirement of debt, a charge of $19 million for severance of key executives, a charge of $17 million for patent related litigation expense, and a charge of $6 million for the impairment of an international manufacturing facility. Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2005 are the following items: a charge of $15 million for an impairment of a facility in the Food and Ingredients segment, a charge of $22 million on the early redemption of $600 million of 7.5% senior debt, a charge of $21 million in connection with matters related to an ongoing SEC investigation, a $10 million charge to reflect an impairment of a brand within the Consumer Foods segment, a benefit of $17 million for legal settlements in the Consumer Foods segment, a fire loss at a Food and Ingredients plant of $10 million, and a charge of $43 million for severance expense in connection with the Companys salaried headcount reduction actions. 28 Table of Contents Higher incentive compensation in fiscal 2006 was partially offset by operating cost efficiencies. Fiscal 2006 included a $6 million benefit from a reduction of estimated severance liabilities for the Companys salaried headcount reduction. Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, gain on the sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2006Operating Profit Fiscal 2005Operating Profit % Increase/ (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 828 $ 934 (11 )% Food and Ingredients 364 310 17 % Trading and Merchandising 189 212 (11 )% International Foods 62 62 % Consumer Foods operating profit decreased $106 million for the fiscal year to $828 million. The decline resulted principally from lower gross profit, as discussed above, as well as $64 million of fiscal 2006 restructuring costs related to reducing SG&A. Costs of implementing the Companys operational efficiency initiatives related to SG&A reduced operating profit by $4 million in fiscal 2005. In addition, the segment recognized $28 million of severance expense during fiscal 2005 and recognized a benefit of $6 million during fiscal 2006 due to reductions of estimated severance liabilities. Fiscal 2006 also reflects additional costs associated with the Companys information technology initiatives, partially offset by lower SG&A costs due to efficiency initiatives previously implemented. Food and Ingredients operating profit increased $54 million to $364 million in fiscal 2006. Results for fiscal 2006 include $6 million of charges related to an asset impairment, facility exit costs and additional headcount reduction initiatives within the Companys restructuring plan. Exclusive of these items, operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved gross margins as discussed above. Fiscal 2005 results included a charge of $15 million for a facility closure, a $10 million charge related to a fire at a Canadian production facility and a $4 million charge related to operational efficiency and salaried headcount reduction initiatives. Trading and Merchandising operating profit decreased $23 million to $189 million in fiscal 2006, resulting from lower gross profit. Fertilizer merchandising profits declined due to difficult market conditions in fiscal 2006, offset in part by better results in merchandising of animal and grain by products. International Foods operating profit was flat between fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, as the increase in gross profit was offset by costs associated with the closure of a production facility and additional advertising and promotion to drive growth within major global brands. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2006, net interest expense was $272 million, a decrease of $42 million, or 13%, over the prior fiscal year. Decreased interest expense reflects the Companys retirement of nearly $900 million of debt during fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2006 also benefited from the redemption of preferred securities of a subsidiary company in the third quarter of 2005, resulting in decreased interest expense of $8 million. These factors were partially offset by a reduced benefit from the interest rate swap agreements terminated in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. These interest rate swap agreements were put in place as a strategy to hedge interest costs associated with long term debt and were closed out in fiscal 2004 in order to lock in existing favorable interest rates. For financial statement purposes, the benefit associated with the termination of the interest rate swap agreements continues to 29 Table of Contents be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. As a result, the Companys net interest expense was reduced by $12 million during fiscal 2006 and $41 million during fiscal 2005. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recognized approximately $14 million of additional interest expense associated with a previously terminated interest rate swap. Gain on Sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation Common Stock During fiscal 2006, the Company sold its remaining 15.4 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $482 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $329 million. During fiscal 2005, the Company sold ten million shares of the Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $283 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately $186 million. Equity Method Investment Earnings (Loss) Equity method investment losses of $50 million and $25 million were recognized in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. During fiscal 2005, the Company determined that the carrying values of its investments in two unrelated equity method investments were other than temporarily impaired and therefore recognized pre tax impairment charges totaling $71 million ($66 million after tax). During fiscal 2006, the Company determined that the fair value of one of these equity method investments had declined further and recorded additional impairment charges. The Company also determined that the carrying value of a third equity method investment was impaired and recorded an impairment charge to reduce that investment to its estimated fair value. These impairment charges totaled $76 million ($73 million after tax) in fiscal 2006. The extent of the impairments was determined based upon the Companys assessment of the recoverability of its investments based primarily upon the expected proceeds of planned dispositions of the investments. The Companys share of earnings from the Companys remaining equity method investments, which include potato processing and grain merchandising businesses, declined by approximately $13 million from the comparable amount in fiscal 2005. Equity method investment earnings included income of approximately $7 million in fiscal 2005 from the fresh beef and pork investment which was divested during fiscal 2005. Results of Discontinued Operations Loss from discontinued operations was $55 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, the Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $83 million, net of tax. Included in these amounts are: impairment charges of $241 million recorded in fiscal 2006 to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale from the Companys discontinued packaged meats business to their estimated fair value less costs to sell, a gain on the disposition of the Companys Cooks Ham business of $110 million in fiscal 2006, pre tax earnings of $180 million from operations of discontinued businesses in fiscal 2006, income tax expense of $110 million in fiscal 2006, impairment charges of $59 million recorded in fiscal 2005 to reduce the carrying values of assets held for sale to their estimated fair values less costs to sell, net gains on the disposition of discontinued businesses of $26 million in fiscal 2005, pre tax earnings of $158 million from operations of the discontinued businesses in fiscal 2005, and income tax expense of $42 million in fiscal 2005. 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2006. In 2006, state income taxes included approximately $26 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to deferred state tax rates. This was largely offset by the tax impact of impairments of equity method investments for which the Company does not expect to receive a significant tax benefit. The effective tax rate was 42% in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, the Company increased its estimate of the effective tax rate for state income taxes, resulting in an overall effective tax rate in excess of the statutory rate. The Company reached an agreement with the IRS with respect to the IRSs examination of the Companys tax returns for fiscal years 2000 through 2002. As a result of the resolution of these matters, the Company reduced income tax expense and the related provision for income taxes payable by $5 million during fiscal 2005. Net income was $534 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006, compared to $642 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. LIQUDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital The Companys primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure while providing the flexibility to pursue its growth objectives. The Company currently uses short term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including its seasonal working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable and other accrued liabilities) needs and a combination of equity and long term debt to finance both its base trade working capital needs and its noncurrent assets. Commercial paper borrowings (usually less than 30 days maturity) are reflected in the Companys consolidated balance sheets within notes payable. At May 27, 2007, the Company had credit lines from banks that totaled approximately $2.2 billion. These lines are comprised of a $1.5 billion five year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions and short term facilities approximating $693 million. The five year facility contains provisions substantially identical to those in the $1.05 billion facility it replaced. The terms of the five year facility provide that the Company may request that the commitments available under the facility be extended for additional one year periods on an annual basis. Following such a request, during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 the commitments under this facility were extended to December 2011. Borrowings under the five year facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. These rates are approximately .30 to .35 percentage points higher than the interest rates for commercial paper. The Company has not drawn upon the five year facility. As of May 27, 2007, the Company had $0.2 million drawn under the short term loan facilities. The long and short term facilities require the Company to repay borrowings if the Companys consolidated funded debt exceeds 65% of the consolidated capital base, as defined, or if fixed charges coverage, as defined, is less than 1.75 to 1.0, as such terms are defined in applicable agreements. As of the end of fiscal 2007, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants. The Company finances its short term liquidity needs with bank borrowings, commercial paper borrowings and bankers acceptances. The average consolidated short term borrowings outstanding under these facilities were $4 million and $14 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Companys overall level of interest bearing debt totaled $3.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2007, compared to $3.6 billion as of the end of fiscal 2006. In December 2006, the Company completed an exchange of approximately $200 million principal amount of its 9.75% subordinated notes due 2021 and $300 million 31 Table of Contents principal amount of its 6.75% senior notes due 2011 for approximately $500 million principal amount of 5.82% senior notes due 2017 and cash of approximately $90 million, in order to improve the Companys debt maturity profile. The Company is amortizing the $90 million cash payment (the unamortized portion of which is reflected as a reduction of senior long term debt in the Companys consolidated balance sheet at May 27, 2007) over the life of the new notes within interest expense. During fiscal 2007, the Company redeemed $12 million of 8.8% unsecured debt due in May 2017. This early retirement of debt, which resulted in a pre tax loss of $0.4 million recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition to this early retirement of debt, the Company made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2007, reducing long term debt by $35 million. Included in current installments of long term debt as of May 28, 2006 was $400 million of 7.125% senior debt due October 2026 due to the existence of a put option that was exercisable by the holders of the debt from August 1, 2006 to September 1, 2006. The holders did not exercise the put option, and therefore, the Company reclassified the $400 million balance to senior long term debt in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 when the put option expired. During fiscal 2006, the Company redeemed $500 million of 6% senior debt due in September 2006 and $250 million of 7.875% senior debt due in September 2010. In addition to these early retirements of debt, the Company made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2006, reducing long term debt by $149 million. As of the end of both fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Companys senior long term debt ratings were all investment grade ratings. A significant downgrade in the Companys credit ratings would not affect the Companys ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facilities, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade to the Companys short term credit ratings would also impact the Companys ability to borrow under its commercial paper program by causing increased borrowing costs and shorter durations and could result in possible access limitations. The Company also has a shelf registration under which it could issue from time to time up to $4 billion in debt securities. In March 2006, the Company completed the divestitures of its Cooks Ham and its seafood businesses for cash proceeds of approximately $442 million. During fiscal 2007, the Company sold its refrigerated meats business, its cheese business, its refrigerated pizza business, an oat milling business, and a dietary supplement business for proceeds of approximately $717 million. During fiscal 2007, the Company sold notes receivable from Swift Foods for approximately $117 million. The notes had been received in connection with the divestiture of a fresh beef and pork business in fiscal 2003. At May 27, 2007, the Companys existing Board authorized share repurchase program permitted management to repurchase up to approximately $88 million of the Companys shares. The Company plans to repurchase shares periodically depending on market conditions. Cash Flows In fiscal 2007, the Company generated $404 million of cash, which was the net result of $943 million generated from operating activities, $523 million generated from investing activities and $1.1 billion used in financing activities. 32 Table of Contents Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $884 million for fiscal 2007 as compared to $911 million generated in fiscal 2006. Improved income from continuing operations, excluding the effects of the sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock in fiscal 2006, was offset by a use of cash for working capital in fiscal 2007. The increased use of cash for working capital was largely due to increased derivative assets and margin account balances (each of which is classified in prepaid expenses and other current assets) and increased commodity inventory balances within the Trading and Merchandising segment. The Company also built inventory balances in the Consumer Foods segment in anticipation of production transition to co packers and other Company owned facilities as part of the previously announced plant rationalization program. In addition to the working capital changes, the Company made contributions to its pension plans of $172 million and $36 million during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was approximately $59 million in fiscal 2007, as compared to $156 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating cash flows from discontinued operations is largely due to the dispositions of the various businesses in fiscal 2007 for which cash flows were generated throughout fiscal 2006. Cash flow from operating activities is one of the Companys primary sources of liquidity. Cash generated from investing activities totaled $523 million for fiscal 2007, versus cash generated from investing activities of $697 million in fiscal 2006. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of proceeds of $117 million from the sale of notes receivable from Swift Foods, $82 million from the sale of property, plant and equipment, including the sale of four aircraft, and $74 million from the sale of an oat milling business, a refrigerated pizza business, and an equity method investment, offset by $425 million of capital expenditures. The cash flows from investing activities also includes approximately $94 million of expenditures related to the Companys purchase of certain warehouse facilities from its lessors, offset by proceeds from immediate sale of these same warehouse facilities to unrelated third parties for $92 million. The Company generated $662 million of investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2007, primarily from the dispositions of the refrigerated meats and cheese businesses. Investing activities for fiscal 2006 include proceeds from the sale of the 15.4 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $482 million and proceeds from the sale of the Companys Cooks Ham and seafood businesses for approximately $442 million, offset by capital expenditures of continuing operations of $263 million. Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.1 billion in fiscal 2007, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased $615 million of its common stock as part of its share repurchase program, paid dividends of $367 million, and made a cash payment of $94 million, including issuance costs, as part of the previously discussed debt exchange. The Company redeemed $12 million of 8.8% unsecured debt due in May 2017 and made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2007, reducing long term debt by $35 million. During fiscal 2006, the Company redeemed $500 million of 6% senior debt due in September 2006 and $250 million of 7.875% senior debt due in September 2010. In addition to these early retirements of debt, the Company made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2006, reducing long term debt by $149 million. The Company also paid dividends of $565 million and repurchased $197 million of its common stock as part of its share repurchase program. The Company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 will be approximately $450 million. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, divestiture proceeds, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital needs, and for planned capital expenditures, share repurchases, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company uses off balance sheet arrangements (e.g., operating leases) where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use. The Company periodically enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in Obligations and Commitments below. 33 Table of Contents The Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of several entities from which it leases office buildings and corporate aircraft. These entities have been determined to be variable interest entities and the Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of these entities. Due to the consolidation of these entities, the Company reflects in its balance sheet: property, plant and equipment of $156 million and $183 million, other assets of $14 million and $12 million, long term debt of $150 million (including current maturities of $6 million) and $192 million (including current maturities of $8 million), minority interest liabilities of $22 million and $6 million, and other accrued liabilities of $1 million and $0, as of May 27, 2007 and May 28, 2006, respectively. The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these entities do not represent additional claims on the general assets of the Company. The creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS As part of its ongoing operations, the Company enters into arrangements that obligate the Company to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as take or pay contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into by the Company in its normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available to the Company. Capital lease and debt obligations, which totaled $3.6 billion at May 27, 2007, are currently recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $645 million at May 27, 2007, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A summary of the Companys contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2007 is as follows (including obligations of discontinued operations): ($ in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Long Term Debt $ 3,575.4 $ 18.2 $ 48.5 $ 1,226.9 $ 2,281.8 Lease Obligations 456.6 79.4 137.3 92.4 147.5 Purchase Obligations 188.4 57.5 69.0 59.0 2.9 Total $ 4,220.4 $ 155.1 $ 254.8 $ 1,378.3 $ 2,432.2 The Companys total obligations of approximately $4.2 billion reflect a decrease of approximately $237 million from the Companys 2006 fiscal year end. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction of lease obligations in connection with the sale of the packaged meats operations. The Company is also contractually obligated to pay interest on its long term debt obligations. The weighted average interest rate of the long term debt obligations outstanding as of May 27, 2007 was approximately 7.2%. 34 Table of Contents As part of its ongoing operations, the Company also enters into arrangements that obligate the Company to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Companys commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2007, are as follows (including commitments of discontinued operations): ($ in millions) Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5 Years Guarantees $ 33.6 $ 6.8 $ 10.0 $ 5.5 $ 11.3 Other Commitments 1.1 1.1 Total $ 34.7 $ 7.9 $ 10.0 $ 5.5 $ 11.3 The Companys total commitments of approximately $35 million include approximately $28 million in guarantees and other commitments the Company has made on behalf of the Companys divested fresh beef and pork business. As part of the fresh beef and pork divestiture, the Company guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs. TRADING ACTIVITIES The Company accounts for certain contracts (e.g., physical commodity purchase/sale contracts and derivative contracts) at fair value. The Company considers a portion of these contracts to be its trading activities; specifically, those contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and its related amendment, SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities (collectively SFAS No. 133). The following table represents the fair value and scheduled maturity dates of trading contracts outstanding as of May 27, 2007: ($ in millions) Fair Value of Contracts as of May 27, 2007 Gross Asset Gross Liability Net Asset TotalFairValue Source of Fair Value Maturityless than1 year Maturity1 3 years Maturityless than1 year Maturity1 3 years Maturityless than1 year Maturity1 3 years Prices actively quoted $ 671.5 $ 8.8 $ (589.4 ) $ (2.4 ) $ 82.1 $ 6.4 $ 88.5 Prices provided by other external sources 109.7 0.8 (115.4 ) (5.7 ) 0.8 (4.9 ) Prices based on other valuation models Total fair value $ 781.2 $ 9.6 $ (704.8 ) $ (2.4 ) $ 76.4 $ 7.2 $ 83.6 In order to minimize the risk of loss associated with non exchange traded transactions with counterparties, the Company utilizes established credit limits and performs ongoing counterparty credit evaluations. The above table excludes commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, including physical contracts to buy or sell commodities at agreed upon fixed prices, as well as derivative contracts (e.g., futures and options) used primarily to hedge an existing asset or liability (e.g., inventory) or an 35 Table of Contents anticipated transaction (e.g., purchase of inventory). The use of such contracts is not considered by the Company to be trading activities as these contracts are considered either normal purchase and sale contracts or hedging contracts. The asset and liability amounts in this table reflect gross positions and are not reduced for offsetting positions with a counterparty when a legal right of offset exists. The prices actively quoted category reflects only contracts for which the fair value is based entirely upon prices actively quoted on major exchanges in the United States. The prices provided by other external sources category represents contracts which contain a pricing component other than prices actively quoted on a major exchange, such as forward commodity positions at locations for which over the counter broker quotes are available. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on the Companys historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management of the Company. The Companys Audit Committee has reviewed managements development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates. Marketing Costs The Company incurs certain costs to promote its products through marketing programs which include advertising, retailer incentives, and consumer incentives. The Company recognizes the cost of each of these types of marketing activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For volume based incentives provided to retailers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on the Companys historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these factors change, managements estimates could change and the Company could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time. Advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled $452 million, $335 million, and $318 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Historically, the Company has entered into over 150,000 individual marketing programs each year resulting in annual costs in excess of $2 billion, which are reflected as a reduction of net sales. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual marketing programs would not result in a material change in the Companys results of operations or cash flows. Income Taxes The Company recognizes current tax liabilities and assets based on an estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current year for each of the jurisdictions in which the Company transacts business. As part of the determination of its current tax liability, management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating positions taken by the Company in its tax returns. The Company has established reserves for probable tax exposures. These reserves, included in current tax liabilities, represent the Companys estimate of amounts expected to be paid, which the Company adjusts over time as more information becomes available. The Company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences (e.g., the difference in book basis versus tax basis of fixed assets resulting from differing depreciation methods). If appropriate, the Company recognizes valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized, based on the Companys assessment of estimated future taxable income, including the consideration of available tax planning strategies. 36 Table of Contents The calculation of current and deferred tax assets (including valuation allowances) and liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment related to the application of complex tax laws, changes in tax laws or related interpretations, uncertainties related to the outcomes of tax audits and changes in the Companys operations or other facts and circumstances. Further, management must continually monitor changes in these factors. Changes in such factors may result in changes to management estimates and could require the Company to adjust its tax assets and liabilities and record additional income tax expense or benefits. Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third party specialists in order to effectively assess the Companys environmental liabilities. Management estimates the Companys environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of the Company, and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. Managements estimate as to its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. The Company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change. The Company has recognized a reserve of approximately $100 million for environmental liabilities as of May 27, 2007. Historically, the underlying assumptions utilized by the Company in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy. Employment Related Benefits The Company incurs certain employment related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers compensation. In order to measure the expense associated with these employment related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to the Company. The estimates used by management are based on the Companys historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. The Company uses third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in the Company recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. The Company recognized pension expense of $83 million, $96 million, and $71 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, which reflected expected returns on plan assets of $134 million, $130 million, and $131 million, respectively. The Company contributed $172 million, $36 million, and $9 million to the Companys pension plans in fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The Company anticipates contributing approximately $13 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2008. One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. The Company selects a discount rate each year (as of its February 28 measurement date) for its plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year by year projected benefit cash flows for the Companys pension plans. The hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moodys Aa) available at the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount rates selected by the Company for determination of pension expense for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 37 Table of Contents 2005 were 5.75%, 5.75%, and 6.0%, respectively. The Company selected a discount rate of 5.75% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2008. A 25 basis point increase in the Companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would decrease pension expense for the Companys pension plans by $9.2 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in the Companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would increase pension expense for the Companys pension plans by $9.7 million for the year. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately $3.7 million for fiscal 2008. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately $9.6 million for fiscal 2008. For its year end pension obligation determination, the Company selected a discount rate of 5.75% for fiscal year 2007 and 2006. Another significant assumption used to account for the Companys pension plans is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, the Company considers long term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plans investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Company selected 7.75% for the long term rate of return on plan assets for determining its fiscal 2007 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $4.4 million. The Company selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2008. When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans, the Company uses a market related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and expected return) over five years. The market related value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2007 was $189 million lower than the actual fair value of plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. The Company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. Based on this information, the Company selected 4.25% for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 as the rate of compensation increase for determining its year end pension obligation. The Company selected 4.25%, 4.25%, and 4.5% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. A 25 basis point increase in the Companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would increase pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $2 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in the Companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 would decrease pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $2 million for the year. The Company selected a rate of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2008. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care benefits. The Company recognized postretirement benefit expense of $10 million, $18 million, and $27 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The Company reflects liabilities of $392 million and $340 million in its balance sheets as of May 27, 2007 and May 28, 2006, respectively. The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on the Companys assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate selected by the Company for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 was 5.5%, 5.5%, and 6.0%, respectively. The Company has selected a discount rate of 5.5% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2008. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would decrease/increase postretirement 38 Table of Contents expense for the Companys plans by $1.2 million. The Company has assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 9.5%, with the trend rate decreasing to 5.0% by 2013. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect: ($ in millions) One PercentIncrease One PercentDecrease Effect on total service and interest cost $ 1.7 $ (1.6 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 28.5 (25.0 ) The Company provides workers compensation benefits to its employees. The measurement of the liability for the Companys cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption made by the Company is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of its obligation. The discount rate used at May 27, 2007 was 5.0%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense. Impairment of Long Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets The Company reduces the carrying amounts of long lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires the Company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, the Company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the Company in such areas as future economic conditions, industry specific conditions, product pricing and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. The Company utilizes a relief from royalty methodology in evaluating impairment of its brands/trademarks. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the Company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. As the calculated fair value of the Companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the Companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This provides entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without being required to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2009. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 159 on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements. SAB 108 requires that the Company quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of the Companys financial statements and related disclosures. The Company adopted SAB 108 effective as of May 27, 2007. The adoption of SAB 108 did not impact the Companys financial statements. 39 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2009. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. SFAS No. 158 required that the Company recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit and retiree medical plans (the Plans) as an asset or liability in the Companys fiscal 2007 year end consolidated balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur (see further discussion in note 17). SFAS No. 158 also requires the Company, no later than fiscal 2009, to measure the funded status of its Plans as of the Companys year end consolidated balance sheet date versus the current measurement date of February 28. Management is currently evaluating the timing and financial statement impact of adopting the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 describes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company plans to adopt FIN 48 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Management is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this statement will have on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, which amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. SFAS No. 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS No. 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 140. SFAS No. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 155 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Sales to affiliates (equity method investees) of $6.2 million, $2.6 million, and $1.7 million for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, are included in net sales. The Company received management fees from affiliates (equity method investees) of $14.8 million, $13.5 million, and $14.1 million in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Accounts receivable from affiliates totaled $2.5 million and $1.8 million at May 27, 2007 and May 28, 2006, respectively.

The Company recognized a gain of approximately $3.0 million on the transaction. The Company leases various buildings that are beneficially owned by Opus Corporation or entities related to Opus Corporation (the Opus Entities). The Opus Entities are affiliates or part of a large, national real estate 40 Table of Contents development company. A member of the Companys board of directors is a beneficial owner, officer and chairman of Opus Corporation and a director or officer of the related entities. The agreements relate to the leasing of land, buildings and equipment for the Company in Omaha, Nebraska. The Company occupies the buildings pursuant to long term leases with Opus Corporation and other investors, which leases contain various termination rights and purchase options. The Company made rental payments of $14.4 million, $15.8 million, and $19.8 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to the Opus Entities. The Company has also entered into construction contracts with the Opus Entities, which relate to the construction of improvements to various properties occupied by the Company.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting the Company are exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates and foreign currencies. These fluctuations impact raw material costs of all reporting segments, as well as the Companys trading activities. Commodities The Company purchases commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging materials to be used in its operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create gross margin risk. The Company enters into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. The Company has policies governing the hedging instruments its businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of its businesses. The Company also monitors the amount of associated counter party credit risk for all non exchange traded transactions. In addition, the Company purchases and sells certain commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats, natural gas, and crude oil in its Trading and Merchandising segment. The Companys trading activities are limited in terms of maximum dollar exposure, as measured by a dollar at risk methodology and monitored to ensure compliance. The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. In practice, as markets move, the Company actively manages its risk and adjusts hedging strategies as appropriate. Fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on the Companys net derivative position by commodity at each quarter end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying commodity positions that are being hedged. The values of commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument. Effect of 10% change in market prices (based upon positions at the end of each fiscal quarter): (in millions) 2007 2006 Processing Activities Grains High $ 7.2 $ 11.7 Low 1.8 Average 5.2 6.1 Meats High 0.3 0.6 Low 0.3 Average 0.1 0.5 Energy High 17.0 42.8 Low 2.4 1.5 Average 9.0 18.1 Trading Activities Grains High 75.0 45.4 Low 33.4 15.0 Average 56.1 28.1 Meats High 8.9 6.0 Low Average 4.9 3.8 Energy High 20.2 16.5 Low 4.1 Average 9.5 8.0 42 Table of Contents Interest Rates The Company may use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of debt. At the end of fiscal 2007 and 2006, the Company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding, as all of the Companys interest rate swap agreements were terminated in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. As of May 27, 2007 and May 28, 2006, the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.8 billion, based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of May 27, 2007 and May 28, 2006, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $253 million and $257 million, respectively, while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $288 million and $293 million, respectively. Foreign Operations In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of its processing and trading operations. This activity primarily relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory, capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis for the Companys processing and trading operations. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in exchange rates. Actual changes in exchange rates may differ from hypothetical changes. Fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was based on the Companys net foreign currency position at each quarter end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying foreign denominated transactions that are being hedged. The currencies hedged have a high inverse correlation to exchange rate changes of the foreign currency derivative instrument.
