ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to the Companys financial performance and condition. The discussion should be read together with the Companys financial statements and related notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Results for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2008 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future. Executive Overview ConAgra Foods, Inc. (NYSE: CAG) is one of North Americas leading packaged food companies, serving grocery retailers, as well as restaurants and other foodservice establishments. Popular ConAgra Foods consumer brands include: Banquet&reg;, Chef Boyardee&reg;, Egg Beaters&reg;, Healthy Choice&reg;, Hebrew National&reg;, Hunts&reg;, Marie Callenders&reg;, Orville Redenbachers&reg;, Reddi wip&reg;, PAM&reg;, and many others. Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were $1.90, including $1.06 per diluted share of income from continuing operations and income of $0.84 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Fiscal 2007 diluted earnings per share were $1.51, including income from continuing operations of $0.95 per diluted share and income from discontinued operations of $0.56 per diluted share. Several items affect the comparability of results of continuing operations, as discussed in Other Significant Items of NoteItems Impacting Comparability, below. Operating Initiatives ConAgra Foods is implementing operational improvement initiatives that are intended to generate profitable sales growth, improve profit margins, and expand returns on capital over time. Recent developments in the Companys strategies and action plans include: Pricing initiatives: The Company has faced significant increases in input costs during fiscal 2008 and expects this trend to continue into fiscal 2009. The Company implemented price increases across a significant portion of its Consumer Foods portfolio in the latter portion of fiscal 2008. The Company is continuing to monitor the challenging input cost environment and plans to implement additional pricing actions designed to offset these effects. Innovation: The Companys recent innovation investments in its Consumer Foods operations resulted in the development of a variety of new products. Healthy Choice&reg; Caf&eacute; Steamers, Healthy Choice&reg; Panini, new flavors of Healthy Choice&reg; Soups, Hunts&reg; Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes, Orville Redenbachers&reg; Smart Pop! Low Sodium, Orville Redenbachers&reg; Natural, Chef Boyardee&reg; Mac & Cheese, PAM&reg; Professional, and Fleischmanns&reg; and Parkay&reg; Soft Spreads were introduced to the market during fiscal 2008. In addition, the Companys Food and Ingredients businesses, principally Lamb Weston, ConAgra Mills, and Gilroy Foods and Flavors, continue to invest in a variety of new foodservice products and ingredients for foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. These new products contributed to unit volume and sales growth in fiscal 2008. Together with additional new products planned for fiscal 2009 and beyond, these products are expected to contribute to additional sales growth and market expansion in the future. Sales growth initiatives: The Company is continuing to implement sales improvement initiatives focused on penetrating the fastest growing channels, better return on customer trade arrangements, and optimal shelf placement for the Companys most profitable products. These, along with the marketing initiatives, are intended to generate profitable sales growth. Reducing costs throughout the supply chain and the general and administrative functions: The Company began an intense focus on cost reduction initiatives in February 2006, when it initiated the fiscal 2006 2008 restructuring plan (the 2006 2008 restructuring plan). 15 Table of Contents Substantially completed during fiscal 2008, the 2006 2008 restructuring plan focused on streamlining the supply chain and reducing selling, general and administrative costs. During fiscal 2008, the Company identified additional opportunities to create a more efficient organization, particularly in its Consumer Foods operations and related functional organizations and its International Foods operation (the 2008 2009 restructuring plan). The combined cost of these plans, updated through May 25, 2008, is forecasted at $276 million. The Company has incurred total charges under these plans, since inception through May 25, 2008, of an aggregate of $259 million. Together, these plans were approved with the expectation they would result in significant cost savings. The fiscal 2008 2009 restructuring plan is expected to generate new annual savings of $40 million in future years. References to the Companys restructuring plans (the plans) refer to both the 2006 2008 restructuring plan and the 2008 2009 restructuring plan, unless otherwise noted. In addition to restructuring activities, the Company has ongoing initiatives, principally focused on supply chain activities manufacturing, logistics, and procurement functions, which have resulted in significant cost savings in recent periods. Portfolio changes: In recent years, the Company divested operations that limited its ability to achieve efficiency targets and focus resources on core food businesses. The divestiture of these operations has helped to simplify the Companys operations and is expected to enhance efficiency initiatives and allow greater investment in core food businesses going forward. Discontinued Operations. The results of operations for the trading and merchandising operations, principally comprising the Trading and Merchandising reporting segment, which were divested in June 2008 (subsequent to the Companys fiscal 2008 year end), the Knotts Berry Farm&reg; jelly and jam operations, which were divested in May 2008, and the packaged meats and packaged cheese businesses, which were divested in fiscal 2007, are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Capital Allocation During fiscal 2008, the Company funded the following: capital expenditures of approximately $451 million; dividend payments of approximately $362 million; the repurchase of approximately $188 million (approximately 7.5 million shares) of common stock; the acquisition of Watts Brothers, a privately held group of vegetable processing and agricultural operations, for approximately $132 million in cash plus assumed liabilities of approximately $101 million, including debt of approximately $84 million. Immediately following the close of the transaction, the Company retired approximately $64 million of the debt; the acquisition of Alexia Foods, a privately held natural food company for approximately $50 million in cash plus assumed liabilities. Alexia Foods offers premium natural and organic food items including potato products, appetizers, and artisan breads; the acquisition of Lincoln Snacks, a privately held company offering a variety of snack food brands and private label products, for approximately $50 million in cash plus assumed liabilities; and the acquisition of assets of Twin City Foods, a potato processing business, for approximately $23 million in cash. The Company has repurchased its shares from time to time based on market conditions. The Company began fiscal 2008 with an authorization to purchase up to $88 million of its common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During fiscal 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to 16 Table of Contents repurchase up to an additional $500 million of the Companys common stock. Subsequent to fiscal 2008, the Companys authorization was increased an additional $500 million. The Company initiated an accelerated share repurchase program during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 under which it will exhaust its current share repurchase authorization through the expenditure of up to $900 million to repurchase its common stock. During the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Board of Directors increased the rate of regular, quarterly dividends on the Companys common stock to $0.19 per common share. On June 23, 2008, the Company completed the sale of its trading and merchandising operations, principally comprising its Trading and Merchandising reporting segment. Proceeds were comprised of (1) approximately $2.2 billion of cash, net of transaction costs (including incentive compensation amounts due to ConAgra Trade Group employees), (2) paid in kind debt securities issued by the purchaser with aggregate principal amount of $550 million to be recorded at fair market value of $483 million, (3) a short term receivable of $37 million due from the purchaser, and (4) a warrant to purchase approximately 5% of the equity of the purchaser, to be recorded at estimated fair market value of $2 million. The Company expects to use the cash proceeds to complete the share repurchase discussed above and to significantly reduce its commercial paper balances. Opportunities and Challenges The Company believes that its operating initiatives will favorably impact future sales, profits, profit margins, and returns on capital. Because of the scope of change underway, there is risk that these broad change initiatives will not be successfully implemented. Input costs, competitive pressures, the ability to execute the operational changes and implement pricing actions, among other factors, will affect the timing and impact of these initiatives. The Company has faced increased costs for many of its significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. The Company seeks to mitigate the higher input costs through pricing and productivity initiatives, and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption. The Company expects to take further price increases during fiscal 2009. The Company is also focusing on selling, general and administrative cost initiatives, as evidenced by the initiation of the Companys restructuring plans. However, the Company expects higher input costs to continue into fiscal 2009. If the benefits from pricing actions, supply chain productivity improvements, economic hedges, and selling, general and administrative cost reduction initiatives are insufficient to cover these expected higher input costs, results of operations, particularly Consumer Foods operating profit, may continue to be negatively impacted. Changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of the Companys products. The Company offers a variety of food products which appeal to a range of consumer preferences and utilizes innovation and marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing consumer trends. As part of these programs, the Company introduces new products and product extensions. Consolidation of many of the Companys customers continues to result in increased buying power, negotiating strength, and complex service requirements for those customers. This trend, which is expected to continue, may negatively impact gross margins, particularly in the Consumer Foods segment. In order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation, the Company is continually evaluating its consumer marketing, sales, and customer service strategies. The Company is implementing trade promotion programs designed to improve return on investment, and pursuing shelf placement and customer service improvement initiatives. Other Significant Items of Note Items Impacting Comparability The Company faced two significant product recalls during fiscal 2007 and 2008 that impact comparability of results. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company initiated the recall of all varieties of peanut butter 17 Table of Contents manufactured at its Sylvester, Georgia plant. Product reintroduction began in August 2007. In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company voluntarily recalled all of its Banquet and private label pot pies. Product reintroduction began in December 2007. Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2008 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations charges totaling $45 million ($28 million after tax) related to product recalls, charges totaling $26 million ($16 million after tax) under the Companys restructuring plans, and net tax benefits of approximately $19 million related to changes in the Companys legal entity structure, favorable settlements, and changes in estimates. Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2007 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations charges totaling $103 million ($64 million after tax) under the Companys 2006 2008 restructuring plan, charges totaling $66 million ($41 million after tax) related to the peanut butter recall, gains of approximately $21 million ($13 million after tax) related to the divestiture of an oat milling business and other non core assets, benefits of $13 million ($8 million after tax) resulting from favorable legal settlements, a benefit of approximately $7 million ($5 million after tax) resulting from a favorable resolution of franchise tax matters, net tax charges of approximately $6 million related to unfavorable settlements and changes in estimates, and a gain of approximately $4 million resulting from the sale of an equity investment in a malt business, and related income tax benefits of approximately $4 million, resulting in an after tax gain of approximately $8 million. Reported within Discontinued Operations gain of approximately $66 million ($37 million after tax) primarily from the divestiture of the packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business, charges of approximately $21 million ($13 million after tax) related to an impairment charge based upon the final negotiations of the sale of the packaged meats business, and a benefit of approximately $9 million ($6 million after tax) related to a postretirement curtailment gain associated with the divestiture of the packaged meats operations. SEGMENT REVIEW The Company reports its continuing operations in three reporting segments: Consumer Foods, Food and Ingredients, and International Foods. 18 Table of Contents Consumer Foods The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded, private label, and customized food products which are sold in various retail and foodservice channels. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf stable temperature classes. Food and Ingredients The Food and Ingredients reporting segment includes commercially branded foods and ingredients, which are sold principally to foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segments primary products include specialty potato products, milled grain ingredients, dehydrated vegetables and seasonings, blends, and flavors. International Foods The International Foods reporting segment includes branded food products which are sold in retail channels principally in North America, Europe, and Asia. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf stable temperature classes. At the beginning of fiscal 2008, the Company shifted management responsibility of its handheld product operations into the Consumer Foods segment from the Food and Ingredients segment, and a portion of its international snack export business from the Consumer Foods segment to the International Foods segment. Accordingly, all prior periods have been recharacterized to reflect these changes. In fiscal 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2008 2009 restructuring plan, which was recommended by executive management to streamline the Companys international operations and to improve the efficiency of the Companys Consumer Foods and related functional organizations. The plan includes the reorganization of the Consumer Foods operations, integration of the international headquarters function into the Companys domestic Consumer Foods business, exiting of a number of international markets, and reducing administrative headcount. Together, these actions are intended to reduce manufacturing and selling, general and administrative costs, and improve operating margins. The Company has also begun transitioning the direct management of the Consumer Foods reporting segment to the Chief Executive Officer. As a result of these plans, which are expected to be fully implemented early in fiscal 2009, the Company expects to change its reporting segments beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2008Net Sales Fiscal 2007Net Sales % Increase Consumer Foods $ 6,800 $ 6,497 5 % Food and Ingredients 4,128 3,422 21 % International Foods 678 613 10 % Total $ 11,606 $ 10,532 10 % Overall, Company net sales increased $1.1 billion to $11.6 billion in fiscal 2008, reflecting increased pricing in the milling and specialty potato operations of the Food and Ingredients segment and increased volume and pricing in the Consumer Foods segment. 19 Table of Contents Consumer Foods net sales increased $303 million, or 5%, for the year to $6.8 billion. Results reflect an increase of three percentage points from improved net pricing and product mix and two percentage points of improvement from higher volumes. Net pricing and volume improvements were achieved in many of the Companys priority investment and enabler brands. The impact of product recalls partially offset these improvements. The Company implemented significant price increases for many Consumer Foods products during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Continued net sales improvements are expected into fiscal 2009 when the Company expects to receive the benefit of these pricing actions for full fiscal periods. Sales of some of the Companys most significant brands, including Chef Boyardee&reg;, DAVID&reg;, Egg Beaters&reg;, Healthy Choice&reg;, Hebrew National&reg;, Hunts&reg;, Marie Callenders&reg;, Manwich&reg;, Orville Redenbachers&reg;, PAM&reg;, Ro*Tel&reg;, Rosarita&reg;, Snack Pack&reg;, Swiss Miss&reg;, Wesson&reg;, and Wolf&reg; grew in fiscal 2008. Sales of ACT II&reg;, Andy Capp&reg;, Banquet&reg;, Crunch n Munch&reg;, Kid Cuisine&reg;, Parkay&reg;, Pemmican&reg;, Reddi Wip&reg;, and Slim Jim&reg; declined in fiscal 2008. Net sales in the Consumer Foods segment are not comparable across periods due to a variety of factors. The Company initiated a peanut butter recall in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and reintroduced Peter Pan&reg; peanut butter products in August 2007. Sales of all peanut butter products, including both branded and private label, in fiscal 2008 were $14 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007. Consumer Foods net sales were also adversely impacted by the recall of Banquet&reg; and private label pot pies in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Net sales of pot pies were lower by approximately $22 million in fiscal 2008, relative to fiscal 2007, primarily due to product returns and lost sales of Banquet&reg; and private label pot pies. Sales from Alexia Foods and Lincoln Snacks, businesses acquired in fiscal 2008, totaled $66 million in fiscal 2008. The Company divested a refrigerated pizza business during the first half of fiscal 2007. Sales from this business were $17 million in fiscal 2007. Food and Ingredients net sales were $4.1 billion in fiscal 2008, an increase of $706 million, or 21%. Increased sales are reflective of higher sales prices in the Companys milling operations due to higher grain prices, and price and volume increases in the Companys potato and dehydrated vegetable operations. The fiscal 2007 divestiture of an oat milling operation resulted in a reduction of sales of $27 million for fiscal 2008, partially offset by increased sales of $18 million from the acquisition of Watts Brothers in February 2008. International Foods net sales increased $65 million to $678 million. The strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately $36 million of this increase. The segment achieved a 5% increase in sales volume in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting increased unit sales in Canada and Mexico, and modest increases in net pricing. Gross Profit (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2008Gross Profit Fiscal 2007Gross Profit % Increase/(Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 1,802 $ 1,923 (6 )% Food and Ingredients 724 590 23 % International Foods 190 180 6 % Total $ 2,716 $ 2,693 1 % The Companys gross profit for fiscal 2008 was $2.7 billion, an increase of $23 million, or 1%, over the prior year. The increase in gross profit was largely driven by results in the Food and Ingredients segment, reflecting higher margins in the Companys milling and specialty potato operations, largely offset by reduced gross profits in the Consumer Foods segment. Costs of implementing the Companys restructuring plans reduced gross profit by $4 million and $46 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. 20 Table of Contents Consumer Foods gross profit for fiscal 2008 was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $121 million, or 6%, from the prior year. The decrease in gross profit reflected significantly higher input costs, partially offset by improved net pricing, mix, and volume. The increased input costs were partially offset by productivity improvements and gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs. The factors impacting comparability of Consumer Foods net sales also impact the comparability of Consumer Foods gross profit. Due to the peanut butter recall that was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the subsequent reintroduction of Peter Pan&reg; peanut butter products in August 2007, gross profits in the Consumer Foods segment are not comparable across periods. Consumer Foods gross profit from all peanut butter products, including both branded and private label, in fiscal 2008 were $22 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007. Consumer Foods gross profit on Banquet&reg; and private label pot pies products were lower by approximately $23 million in fiscal 2008, relative to fiscal 2007, primarily due to product returns and lost sales. Newly acquired businesses contributed $11 million to gross profit in fiscal 2008. Costs of implementing the Companys restructuring plans reduced gross profit for fiscal 2008 and 2007 by $2 million and $45 million, respectively. Food and Ingredients gross profit was $724 million for fiscal 2008, an increase of $134 million, or 23%, over the prior year. Improved results reflect increased gross profit of $68 million in the Companys milling operations due to a favorable wheat commodity environment and improved flour conversion margins. The Company also achieved increased gross profit of $65 million in its specialty potato business as benefits from pricing, volume growth, and product mix management exceeded the impact of higher input costs. Results also reflected gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs as well as profits from wheat derivatives trading. International Foods gross profit was $190 million, an increase of $10 million over the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2008 performance reflected increased sales volume of 5%, partially offset by higher input costs, modest net pricing increases and a benefit of $11 million due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes. Gross profit for fiscal 2008 also reflects $2 million of charges related to the execution of the Companys restructuring plans. Gross Margin (Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2008Gross Margin Fiscal 2007Gross Margin Consumer Foods 27 % 30 % Food and Ingredients 18 % 17 % International Foods 28 % 29 % Total Company (continuing operations) 23 % 26 % The Companys gross margin for fiscal 2008 decreased three percentage points compared to fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly increased input costs in the Consumer Foods segment which were not offset by net price increases and productivity improvements. The Company implemented price increases in March of fiscal 2008, the benefits of which are expected to be greater in future periods. The gross margin in the Consumer Foods segment has also been negatively impacted in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 by the costs of product recalls and the costs of implementing the Companys restructuring plans. Gross margin in the Food and Ingredients segment improved due to the factors noted above under Gross Profit. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008, virtually unchanged from the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 reflected the following: a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of $58 million, an increase in salaries expense of $45 million, 21 Table of Contents a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $41 million, charges of $22 million related to the execution of the Companys restructuring plans, charges related to product recalls of $21 million, $14 million of income, net of direct pass through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses, and a decrease in charitable contributions of $12 million. Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2007 were the following items: charges of $57 million related to the Companys restructuring plans, charges related to the peanut butter recall of $36 million, $23 million of income, net of direct pass through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses, gains of $27 million related to the disposition of an oat milling business, certain international licensing rights for a small brand, and four corporate aircraft, a benefit of $13 million for favorable legal settlements, and a benefit of $7 million related to a favorable resolution of franchise tax matters. Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2008OperatingProfit Fiscal 2007OperatingProfit % Increase/(Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 781 $ 848 (8 )% Food and Ingredients 512 435 18 % International Foods 49 64 (23 )% Consumer Foods operating profit decreased $67 million in fiscal 2008 versus the prior year to $781 million. The decrease for the fiscal year was reflective of the decreased gross profit, discussed above, and was influenced by a number of factors, including: restructuring costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses of $6 million and $39 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, costs of the product recalls classified in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $21 million and $36 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, a decrease in advertising and promotion costs of approximately $45 million, and a $23 million decrease in transition services reimbursement income, net of direct pass through costs, related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, similar reimbursement income of $14 million is reflected in general corporate expenses and did not impact operating profit. Food and Ingredients operating profit increased $77 million to $512 million in fiscal 2008. Operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved gross profit, as discussed above. Other factors affecting the increased operating profit included higher selling expense and compensation costs in fiscal 2008, and gains recorded in fiscal 2007 of $18 million related to the Companys sale of an oat milling business and $8 million resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire. 22 Table of Contents International Foods operating profit decreased $15 million to $49 million in fiscal 2008. Operating profit included the increase in gross profit offset by $16 million of costs associated with the implementation of the Companys restructuring plans. Fiscal 2007 operating profit included a gain of approximately $4 million related to the sale of certain international licensing rights for a small brand and $2 million of charges related to the peanut butter recall. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2008, net interest expense was $253 million, an increase of $34 million, or 15%, over the prior fiscal year. Increased interest expense reflects the Companys use of commercial paper to finance higher working capital balances in all segments, particularly in the Trading and Merchandising business which is now presented within discontinued operations. The Company also earned less interest income due to lower balances of cash on hand in fiscal 2008. Equity Method Investment Earnings The Company includes its share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on its economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. The Companys share of earnings from the Companys equity method investments were $50 million and $28 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase was driven by improved performance of a foreign potato venture. Results of Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $412 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2008. Included in these amounts are: pre tax earnings of $669 million, largely the result of very strong profits from the fertilizer, agricultural merchandising, energy trading, and agricultural trading operations of the Trading and Merchandising business, and income tax expense of $257 million. Income from discontinued operations was $282 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2007. Included in these amounts are: pre tax earnings of $457 million from operations of discontinued businesses, largely the result of strong profits from the trading of fertilizer and crude oil in the trading and merchandising business, a pre tax curtailment gain of $9 million related to postretirement benefits of the packaged meats operations divested in fiscal 2007, and an $8 million gain related to a legal settlement in connection with the packaged meats operations, impairment charges of $21 million based on the final negotiations related to the sale of the packaged meats operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, a gain of $64 million primarily from the disposition of the Companys packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business, and income tax expense of $175 million. Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 31% for fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, the Company adjusted its estimates of income taxes payable due to increased benefits from a domestic manufacturing deduction and lower foreign income taxes, resulting in a lower than normal effective tax rate. These impacts and tax benefits related to a change in the legal structure of the Companys subsidiaries are the primary contributors to the decrease in the year to date effective tax rate from fiscal 2007. 23 Table of Contents The effective tax rate was 34% in fiscal 2007. In 2007, state income taxes included approximately $24 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to state tax jurisdictions. This was offset by the tax impact of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit settlement. The Company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal 2009, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be in the range of 35% to 36%. Net income was $931 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008, compared to $765 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007. 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2007Net Sales Fiscal 2006Net Sales % Increase/(Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 6,497 $ 6,511 % Food and Ingredients 3,422 3,129 9 % International Foods 613 611 % Total $ 10,532 $ 10,251 3 % Overall, Company net sales increased $281 million to $10.5 billion in fiscal 2007, primarily reflecting favorable results in the Food and Ingredients segment. Increased net sales at the Food and Ingredients segment were primarily the result of price and volume increases. The Consumer Foods and International Foods segments were relatively flat compared to prior year. The peanut butter recall had a negative impact on the Companys fiscal year net sales for the Consumer Foods and International Foods reporting segments. Sales of peanut butter in fiscal 2007 were $92 million, as compared to $147 million in fiscal 2006. Consumer Foods net sales decreased $14 million for the year to $6.5 billion. Sales volume declined by 1% in fiscal 2007. Results reflect the effect of price increases and sales growth in certain of the Companys priority investment brands, offset by the impact of the peanut butter recall, declines in sales of low margin foodservice and private label items, the divestiture of a refrigerated pizza business during the first half of fiscal 2007, and continued SKU rationalization efforts. Net sales of the Companys priority investment brands, which represented approximately 75% of total segment sales during fiscal 2007, increased 1% as a group. Sales growth for some of the Companys most significant brands, including Chef Boyardee&reg;, Egg Beaters&reg;, Hebrew National&reg;, Hunts&reg;, Kid Cuisine&reg;, Orville Redenbachers&reg;, PAM&reg;, Slim Jim&reg;, Snack Pack&reg;, Reddi Wip&reg;, Manwich&reg;, Swiss Miss&reg;, and DAVID&reg;, was largely offset by sales declines for the year for Banquet&reg;, Healthy Choice&reg;, ACT II&reg;, LaChoy&reg;, Pemmican&reg;, The Max&reg;, and Peter Pan&reg;. Peanut butter net sales declined by $55 million from the prior year due to the peanut butter recall. Food and Ingredients net sales increased $293 million to $3.4 billion, primarily reflecting price and volume increases for potato and dehydrated vegetable operations, as well as price increases in the wheat milling operations resulting from higher year over year grain prices. International Foods net sales increased $2 million to $613 million. The strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for a $6 million increase. Growth of the priority investment brands, primarily in Canada and Mexico, was offset by sales declines related to the discontinuance of a number of low margin products and the effect of the peanut butter recall. 24 Table of Contents Gross Profit (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2007Gross Profit Fiscal 2006Gross Profit % Increase Consumer Foods $ 1,923 $ 1,849 4 % Food and Ingredients 590 526 12 % International Foods 180 166 8 % Total $ 2,693 $ 2,541 6 % The Companys gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $2.7 billion, an increase of $152 million, or 6%, from the prior year. Costs of implementing the Companys 2006 2008 restructuring plan reduced gross profit by $46 million and $20 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Fiscal 2007 results include the impact of approximately $30 million due to the peanut butter recall, reflected as a reduction of net sales of $19 million, and an increase of $11 million in cost of goods sold. Consumer Foods gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $1.9 billion, an increase of $74 million from fiscal 2006. Costs of implementing the Companys 2006 2008 restructuring plan reduced gross profit by $45 million and $20 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Also included in fiscal 2007 gross profit is the impact of approximately $29 million due to the peanut butter recall. The increase in gross profit for fiscal 2007 was largely driven by supply chain cost improvements and improved product mix, partially offset by the effects of inflation, the peanut butter recall, and restructuring costs, as discussed above. Food and Ingredients gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $590 million, an increase of $64 million over the prior year. Costs of implementing the Companys 2006 2008 restructuring plan reduced gross profit for fiscal 2007 by $1 million. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increase in net sales, discussed above, partially offset by the divestiture of an oat milling business in the first half of fiscal 2007. International Foods gross profit for fiscal 2007 was $180 million, an increase of $14 million over the prior fiscal year. The increase included $2 million resulting from favorable foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in gross profit also reflected the increases in net sales, as discussed above, favorable product mix and reductions in supply chain costs. Gross profit was reduced by approximately $1 million due to the peanut butter recall. Gross Margin (Gross Profit as a Percentage of Net Sales) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2007Gross Margin Fiscal 2006Gross Margin Consumer Foods 30 % 28 % Food and Ingredients 17 % 17 % International Foods 29 % 27 % Total Company (continuing operations) 26 % 25 % The Companys gross margin for fiscal 2007 was up one percentage point compared to fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting the impact of productivity improvements in the Consumer Foods and Food and Ingredients segments. The impact of these productivity improvements was somewhat offset by reduced margins due to the effects of inflation, the Companys restructuring charges, and the peanut butter recall. 25 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $1.8 billion for fiscal 2007, a decrease of $68 million from the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 reflected: an increase in advertising and promotion expense of $118 million, an increase in management incentive expenses of $84 million, charges of $57 million related to the execution of the Companys 2006 2008 restructuring plan, $23 million of income, net of direct pass through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses, charges related to the peanut butter recall of $36 million, a decrease in selling and marketing expense of $42 million, gains of $27 million related to the disposition of an oat milling business, certain international licensing rights for a small brand, and four corporate aircraft, charges of $20 million related to expensing of stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, a decrease in professional fees of $25 million, an increase in cash charitable donations of $16 million, partially offset by a decrease in product charitable donations of $8 million, a benefit of $13 million for favorable legal settlements, and a benefit of $7 million related to a favorable resolution of franchise tax matters. Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 were the following items: charges of $109 million related to the Companys 2006 2008 restructuring plan, charges of $83 million on an impairment of note from Swift & Company, charges of $30 million on the early retirement of debt, a charge of $19 million for severance of key executives (including a charge of approximately $11 million related to incentive compensation plans), a charge of $17 million for patent related litigation expense, and a charge of $6 million for the impairment of an international manufacturing facility. Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, gain on the sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2007OperatingProfit Fiscal 2006OperatingProfit % Increase Consumer Foods $ 848 $ 833 2 % Food and Ingredients 435 354 23 % International Foods 64 62 3 % 26 Table of Contents Consumer Foods operating profit increased $15 million for fiscal year 2007 to $848 million. The increase for the fiscal year is reflective of the increased gross profit, discussed above, and was influenced by a number of factors, including: restructuring costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses of $39 million and $64 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively, costs of the peanut butter recall related to selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $35 million, an increase in advertising and promotion costs of approximately $93 million, an increase in incentive costs of approximately $42 million, a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $38 million, and reimbursement income of approximately $23 million, net of direct pass through costs, related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses. Food and Ingredients operating profit increased $81 million to $435 million in fiscal 2007. Operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved gross margins, as discussed above. Other factors affecting the operating profit change over fiscal 2006 included: lower selling, general and administrative expenses related to the implementation of the Companys 2006 2008 restructuring plan by $6 million versus fiscal 2006; gains recorded in fiscal 2007 of $18 million related to the Companys sale of an oat milling business and $8 million resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire; and increased incentive and selling expenses versus fiscal 2006. International Foods operating profit increased $2 million to $64 million in fiscal 2007. Operating profit included the increase in gross profit, as discussed above, as well as a gain of approximately $4 million related to the sale of certain international licensing rights for a small brand. These gains were substantially offset by increased advertising and promotion, and selling and marketing expenses, principally due to the expansion of global markets. Fiscal 2006 operating profit was reduced by $6 million in connection with the closure of a production facility in Canada. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2007, net interest expense was $220 million, a decrease of $52 million, or 19%, over the prior fiscal year. Decreased interest expense reflects the Companys retirement of nearly $900 million of debt during fiscal 2006, as well as the Companys retirement of nearly $47 million of debt during fiscal 2007. These factors were partially offset by a reduced benefit from certain interest rate swap agreements terminated in fiscal 2004. The benefit associated with the termination of the interest rate swap agreements continues to be recognized over the term of the debt instruments originally hedged. As a result, the Companys net interest expense was reduced by $4 million during fiscal 2007 and $12 million during fiscal 2006. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company completed an exchange of approximately $200 million principal amount of its 9.75% subordinated notes due 2021 and $300 million principal amount of its 6.75% senior notes due 2011 for approximately $500 million principal amount of 5.82% senior notes due 2017 and cash of approximately $90 million. The Company is amortizing the $90 million cash payment over the life of the new notes within net interest expense. Gain on Sale of Pilgrims Pride Corporation Common Stock During fiscal 2006, the Company sold its remaining 15.4 million shares of Pilgrims Pride Corporation common stock for $482 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $329 million. 27 Table of Contents Equity Method Investment Earnings (Loss) During fiscal 2006, the Company recognized impairment charges totaling $76 million ($73 million after tax) of its investments in a malt venture and an unrelated investment in a foreign prepared foods business, due to declines in the estimated proceeds from the disposition of these investments. The investment in the foreign prepared foods business was disposed of in fiscal 2006. The extent of the impairments was determined based upon the Companys assessment of the recoverability of its investments based primarily upon the expected proceeds of planned dispositions of the investments. During fiscal 2007, the Company completed the disposition of the equity method investment in the malt venture for proceeds of approximately $24 million, including notes and other receivables totaling approximately $7 million. This transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately $4 million, with a related tax benefit of approximately $4 million. The Companys share of earnings from the Companys remaining equity method investments, which include potato processing and grain merchandising businesses, increased by approximately $7 million from the comparable amount in fiscal 2006, driven by improved yields in the potato processing business. Results of Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $282 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2007. Included in these amounts were: pre tax earnings of $457 million from discontinued businesses (which principally include the trading and merchandising operations and the packaged meats and cheese businesses), including: a gain of $64 million primarily from the disposition of the Companys packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business in fiscal 2007, impairment charges of $21 million in fiscal 2007, based on the final negotiations related to the sale of the packaged meats operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, a pre tax curtailment gain of $9 million related to postretirement benefits of the packaged meats operations divested in fiscal 2007, and an $8 million gain related to a legal settlement in connection with the packaged meats operations, income tax expense of $175 million. In fiscal 2006, the Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $70 million, net of tax. Included in these amounts were: pre tax earnings of $251 million from operations of discontinued businesses, which principally include the recently divested trading and merchandising operations, the divested packaged meat and cheese operations, and the divested Cooks Ham business, which include: impairment charges of $241 million to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale from the Companys discontinued packaged meats business to their estimated fair value less costs to sell, a gain on the disposition of the Companys Cooks Ham business of $110 million, and income tax expense of $181 million. Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2007. In 2007, state income taxes included approximately $24 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to state tax jurisdictions. These benefits were offset by the tax impact of an IRS audit settlement. 28 Table of Contents The effective tax rate was 34% in fiscal 2006. In 2006, state income taxes included approximately $26 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to state tax jurisdictions. This was largely offset by the tax impact of impairments of equity method investments for which the Company does not expect to receive a significant tax benefit. Net income was $765 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007, compared to $534 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital The Companys primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides the Company flexibility to pursue its growth objectives. The Company currently uses short term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including its seasonal working capital (accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities) needs and a combination of equity and long term debt to finance both its base working capital needs and its noncurrent assets. Commercial paper borrowings (usually less than 30 days maturity) are reflected in the Companys consolidated balance sheets within notes payable. At May 25, 2008, the Company had credit lines from banks that totaled approximately $2.3 billion. These lines are comprised of a $1.5 billion multi year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which matures in December 2011, uncommitted short term loan facilities approximating $364 million, and uncommitted trade finance facilities approximating $424 million. The multi year facility is a back up facility for the Companys commercial paper program. Borrowings under the multi year facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. These rates are approximately .10 to .15 percentage points higher than the interest rates for commercial paper. The Company has not drawn upon this multi year facility. As of May 25, 2008, the Company had short term notes payable of $578 million that were comprised primarily of commercial paper. The multi year facility requires the Company to repay borrowings if the Companys consolidated funded debt exceeds 65% of the consolidated capital base, as defined, or if fixed charges coverage, as defined, is less than 1.75 to 1.0, as such terms are defined in applicable agreements. As of the end of fiscal 2008, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants. The uncommitted trade finance facilities noted above were maintained in order to finance certain working capital needs of the Companys trading and merchandising operations. Subsequent to the sale of these operations in June 2008, the Company exited these facilities. The Company finances its short term liquidity needs with bank borrowings, commercial paper borrowings, and bankers acceptances. The average consolidated short term borrowings outstanding under these facilities were $419 million and $4 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in commercial paper borrowings was primarily due to higher working capital needs during the year, principally in the recently divested trading and merchandising operations. The Companys overall level of interest bearing long term debt, inclusive of current maturities, totaled $3.5 billion at the end of both fiscal 2008 and 2007. In December 2006, the Company completed an exchange of approximately $200 million principal amount of its 9.75% subordinated notes due 2021 and $300 million principal amount of its 6.75% senior notes due 2011 for approximately $500 million principal amount of 5.82% senior notes due 2017 and cash of approximately $90 million, in order to improve the Companys debt maturity profile. The Company is amortizing the $90 million cash payment (the unamortized portion of which is reflected as a reduction of senior long term debt in the Companys consolidated balance sheet at May 25, 2008) over the life of the new notes within interest expense. As part of the Watts Brothers acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company assumed $84 million of debt, of which the Company immediately repaid $64 million. 29 Table of Contents The Company made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2008, reducing long term debt by $21 million. As of the end of both fiscal 2008 and 2007, the Companys senior long term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in the Companys credit ratings would not affect the Companys ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facilities, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade to the Companys short term credit ratings would also affect the Companys ability to borrow under its commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as potentially limiting access. The Company also has an effective shelf registration statement under which it could issue, from time to time, up to $4 billion in debt securities. In March 2006, the Company completed the divestitures of its Cooks Ham and its seafood businesses for cash proceeds of approximately $442 million. During fiscal 2007, the Company sold its refrigerated meats business, its cheese business, its refrigerated pizza business, an oat milling business, and a dietary supplement business for proceeds of approximately $717 million. During fiscal 2007, the Company sold notes receivable from Swift Foods for approximately $117 million, net of transaction expenses. The notes had been received in connection with the divestiture of a fresh beef and pork business in fiscal 2003. The Company has repurchased its shares from time to time based on market conditions. The Company began fiscal 2008 with an authorization to purchase up to $88 million of its common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During fiscal 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of the Companys common stock. The Company repurchased $188 million of its shares during fiscal 2008. Subsequent to fiscal 2008, the Companys authorization increased an additional $500 million. The Company initiated an accelerated share repurchase program during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 under which it will exhaust its current share repurchase authorization through the purchase of up to $900 million of its common stock. Subsequent to fiscal 2008, the Company received approximately $2.2 billion in cash, net of transaction costs, as a portion of the proceeds from the disposition of its trading and merchandising operations. Cash Flows In fiscal 2008, the Company used $564 million of cash, which was the net result of $102 million generated from operating activities, $644 million used in investing activities, and $22 million used in financing activities. Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $382 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to $851 million generated in fiscal 2007. Improved income from continuing operations was offset by a use of cash for working capital in fiscal 2008. The increased use of cash for working capital was largely due to increased inventory balances in the Consumer Foods and Food and Ingredients segments due to increased inventory quantities and higher wheat and potato prices. In addition to the working capital changes, the Company made contributions to its pension plans of $8 million and $172 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was approximately $280 million in fiscal 2008, primarily due to the increased market value of commodity inventory balances and derivative assets, as compared to $93 million generated in fiscal 2007. Cash used in investing activities totaled $644 million for fiscal 2008, versus cash generated from investing activities of $523 million in fiscal 2007. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of expenditures of $255 million related to the acquisition of businesses (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and capital expenditures of $490 million, which included approximately $39 million of expenditures related to the Companys purchase of certain warehouse facilities from its lessors (these warehouses 30 Table of Contents were sold for proceeds of approximately $36 million to unrelated third parties immediately thereafter), offset by $30 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of proceeds of $117 million from the sale of notes receivable from Swift Foods, $74 million from the sale of property, plant and equipment, including the sale of four aircraft, and $74 million from the sale of an oat milling business, a refrigerated pizza business, and an equity method investment, offset by capital expenditures of $480 million, which included approximately $94 million of expenditures related to the Companys purchase of certain warehouse facilities from its lessors (these warehouses were sold for proceeds of approximately $92 million to unrelated third parties immediately thereafter). The Company generated $33 million from investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2008, primarily from the sale of the Knotts Berry Farm&reg; jams and jellies brand and operations, as compared to $632 million in fiscal 2007, primarily related to the divestitures of the Companys refrigerated meats and cheese businesses. Cash used in financing activities totaled $22 million in fiscal 2008, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased $188 million of its common stock as part of its share repurchase program and paid dividends of $362 million. As part of the Watts Brothers acquisition, the Company repaid $64 million of assumed long term debt subsequent to the acquisition. In addition to these early retirements of debt, the Company made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2008, reducing long term debt by $21 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, the Company increased its short term borrowings by $577 million, primarily reflecting the financing of significantly increased working capital. During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased $615 million of its common stock as part of its share repurchase program, paid dividends of $367 million, and made a cash payment of $94 million, including issuance costs, as part of the previously discussed debt exchange. The Company redeemed $12 million of 8.8% unsecured debt due in May 2017 and made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2007, reducing long term debt by $35 million. The Company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 will be approximately $475 million. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, divestiture proceeds, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, planned share repurchases, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company uses off balance sheet arrangements (e.g., operating leases) where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use. The Company periodically enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in Obligations and Commitments, below. The Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of several entities from which it leases corporate aircraft. For periods ending prior to November 25, 2007, the Company consolidated several entities from which it leases office buildings. Each of these entities had been determined to be a variable interest entity and the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of these entities. In September 2007, the Company ceased to be the primary beneficiary of the entities from which it leases office buildings and, accordingly, the Company discontinued the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of these entities. Due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities, the Company reflected in its balance sheets: May 25,2008 May 27,2007 Property, plant and equipment, net $ 51.8 $ 155.9 Other assets 13.8 Current installments of long term debt 3.3 6.1 Senior long term debt, excluding current installments 50.9 144.1 Other accrued liabilities 0.6 0.6 Other noncurrent liabilities 21.9 31 Table of Contents The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these entities do not represent additional claims on the general assets of the Company. The creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities to which they have advanced credit. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS As part of its ongoing operations, the Company enters into arrangements that obligate the Company to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as take or pay contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into by the Company in its normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available to the Company. Capital lease and debt obligations, which totaled $3.5 billion at May 25, 2008, are currently recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled $1.7 billion at May 25, 2008, are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A summary of the Companys contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2008 was as follows (including obligations of discontinued operations): ($ in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5Years Long Term Debt $ 3,531.4 $ 15.4 $ 521.6 $ 751.8 $ 2,242.6 Lease Obligations 514.9 89.2 148.1 106.9 170.7 Purchase Obligations 1,199.6 1,078.6 104.0 16.3 0.7 Total $ 5,245.9 $ 1,183.2 $ 773.7 $ 875.0 $ 2,414.0 The purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect approximately $374 million of open purchase orders, some of which are not legally binding. These purchase orders are settlable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year. The Company is also contractually obligated to pay interest on its long term debt obligations. The weighted average interest rate of the long term debt obligations outstanding as of May 25, 2008 was approximately 7.2%. The Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of certain entities from which it leases corporate aircraft. These entities have been determined to be variable interest entities and the Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of these entities. The amounts reflected in contractual obligations of long term debt, in the table above, include $54 million of liabilities of these variable interest entities to the creditors of such entities. The long term debt recognized as a result of consolidating these entities does not represent additional claims on the general assets of the Company. The creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities. As of May 25, 2008, the Company was obligated to make rental payments of $67 million to the variable interest entities, of which $7 million is due in less than one year, $13 million is due in one to three years, and $47 million is due in three to five years. Such amounts are not reflected in the table, above. As part of its ongoing operations, the Company also enters into arrangements that obligate the Company to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in the Companys 32 Table of Contents consolidated balance sheet. The Companys commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2008, were as follows (including commitments of discontinued operations): ($ in millions) Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5Years Guarantees $ 55.3 $ 31.9 $ 7.9 $ 5.4 $ 10.1 Other Commitments 1.0 1.0 Total $ 56.3 $ 32.9 $ 7.9 $ 5.4 $ 10.1 The Companys total commitments of approximately $56 million include approximately $23 million in guarantees and other commitments the Company has made on behalf of the Companys divested fresh beef and pork business. As part of the fresh beef and pork divestiture, the Company guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs. The Company is a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the terms of certain agreements, the Company has guaranteed repayment of short term bank loans of the potato suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 25, 2008, the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by the Company was approximately $26 million, included in the table above. The Company has not established a liability for these guarantees, as the Company has determined that the likelihood of its required performance under the guarantees is remote. The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for income taxes under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (as amended), as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement of its reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 25, 2008 was $76 million. TRADING ACTIVITIES The Company accounts for certain contracts (e.g., physical commodity purchase/sale contracts and derivative contracts) at fair value. The Company considers a portion of these contracts to be its trading activities. The following table excludes certain commodity based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, including physical contracts to buy or sell commodities (generally within the Companys flour milling business and grain merchandising business, which is now included within discontinued operations) at agreed upon fixed prices, as well as derivative contracts (e.g., futures and options) used primarily to create an economic hedge of an existing asset or liability (e.g., inventory) or an anticipated transaction (e.g., purchase of inventory). The use of such contracts is not considered by the Company to be trading activities as these contracts are considered either normal purchase and sale contracts or economic hedging contracts. The Company includes in the following table all derivative instruments, including physical contracts related to the trading of energy related commodities (such as petroleum products and natural gas). 33 Table of Contents The following table represents the fair value and scheduled maturity dates of such contracts outstanding as of May 25, 2008: ($ in millions) Fair Value of Contracts as of May 25, 2008 Gross Asset Gross Liability Net Asset TotalFairValue Source of Fair Value Maturityless than1 year Maturity1 3years Maturityless than1 year Maturity1 3 years Maturityless than1 year Maturity1 3 years Prices actively quoted $ 1,636.5 $ 62.1 $ (1,464.2 ) $ (12.6 ) $ 172.3 $ 49.5 $ 221.8 Prices provided by other external sources 188.7 (209.0 ) (0.3 ) (20.3 ) (0.3 ) (20.6 ) Prices based on other valuation models Total fair value $ 1,825.2 $ 62.1 $ (1,673.2 ) $ (12.9 ) $ 152.0 $ 49.2 $ 201.2 A significant majority of the amounts in the table above reflect the activities of the recently divested trading and merchandising operations. In order to minimize the risk of loss associated with non exchange traded transactions with counterparties, the Company utilizes established credit limits and performs ongoing counterparty credit evaluations. The asset and liability amounts in the table above reflect gross positions and are not reduced for offsetting positions with a counterparty when a legal right of offset exists. The prices actively quoted category reflects only contracts for which the fair value is based entirely upon prices actively quoted on major exchanges in the United States. The prices provided by other external sources category represents contracts which contain a pricing component other than prices actively quoted on a major exchange, such as forward commodity positions at locations for which over the counter broker quotes are available. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on the Companys historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of the Companys accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management of the Company. The Companys Audit Committee has reviewed managements development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates. Marketing Costs The Company incurs certain costs to promote its products through marketing programs which include advertising, retailer incentives, and consumer incentives. The Company recognizes the cost of each of these types of marketing activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For volume based incentives provided to retailers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on the Companys historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these factors change, managements estimates could change and the Company could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time. Historically, the Company has entered into over 150,000 individual marketing programs each year with customers, resulting in annual costs in excess of $2 billion, which are reflected as a reduction of net sales. 34 Table of Contents Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual customer marketing programs would not result in a material change in the Companys results of operations or cash flows. Advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled $393 million, $452 million, and $334 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Income Taxes The Companys income tax expense is based on the Companys income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Companys income tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. Management reviews the Companys tax positions quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. Management uses historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, the Company employs various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third party specialists in order to effectively assess the Companys environmental liabilities. Management estimates the Companys environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of the Company, and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. Managements estimate as to its potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. The Company does not discount its environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change. The Company has recognized a reserve of approximately $95 million for environmental liabilities as of May 25, 2008. Historically, the underlying assumptions utilized by the Company in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy. Employment Related Benefits The Company incurs certain employment related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers compensation. In order to measure the expense associated with these employment related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to the Company. The estimates used by 35 Table of Contents management are based on the Companys historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. The Company uses third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in the Company recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. The Company recognized pension expense of $65 million, $83 million, and $96 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, which reflected expected returns on plan assets of $149 million, $134 million, and $130 million, respectively. The Company contributed $8 million, $172 million, and $36 million to the Companys pension plans in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company anticipates contributing approximately $7 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2009. One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. The Company selects a discount rate each year (as of its fiscal year end measurement date for fiscal 2008 and thereafter) for its plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year by year projected benefit cash flows for the Companys pension plans. The hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moodys Aa) available at the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount rate selected by the Company for determination of pension expense for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 was 5.75%. The Company selected a discount rate of 6.6% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point increase in the Companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would decrease pension expense for the Companys pension plans by $3.7 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in the Companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would increase pension expense for the Companys pension plans by $9.6 million for the year. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately $1.5 million for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately $1.4 million for fiscal 2009. For its year end pension obligation determination, the Company selected a discount rate of 6.6% and 5.75% for fiscal year 2008 and 2007, respectively. Another significant assumption used to account for the Companys pension plans is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, the Company considers long term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plans investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, the Company selected 7.75% for the long term rate of return on plan assets for determining its fiscal 2008 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $5 million. The Company selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $5 million. When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans, the Company uses a market related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and expected return) over five years. The market related value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2008 was $257 million lower than the actual fair value of plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. The Company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. Based on this information, the Company selected 4.25% for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 as the rate of compensation increase for determining its year end pension obligation. The Company selected 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006. A 25 basis point increase in the Companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 would increase pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $2 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in the Companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the 36 Table of Contents beginning of fiscal 2008 would decrease pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $2 million for the year. The Company selected a rate of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine its pension expense for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would increase/decrease pension expense for the Companys pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care benefits. The Company recognized postretirement benefit expense of $23 million, $10 million, and $18 million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company reflects liabilities of $378 million and $392 million in its balance sheets as of May 25, 2008 and May 27, 2007, respectively. The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on the Companys assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate selected by the Company for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 was 5.5%. The Company has selected a discount rate of 6.4% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2009. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the Companys discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease/increase postretirement expense for the Companys plans by approximately $1 million. The Company has assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 9.5%, with the trend rate decreasing to 5.5% by 2013. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect: ($ in millions) One PercentIncrease One PercentDecrease Effect on total service and interest cost $ 1.7 $ (1.6 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 25.9 (22.6 ) The Company provides workers compensation benefits to its employees. The measurement of the liability for the Companys cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption made by the Company is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of its obligation. The discount rate used at May 25, 2008 was 5.0%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense. Impairment of Long Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets The Company reduces the carrying amounts of long lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires the Company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, the Company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the Company in such areas as future economic conditions, industry specific conditions, product pricing and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long lived assets, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets. The Company utilizes a relief from royalty methodology in evaluating impairment of its brands/trademarks. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the Company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. As the calculated fair value of the Companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the Companys goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge. 37 Table of Contents RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. This standard requires enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. This statement is effective for the Companys third quarter of fiscal 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Upon its adoption, effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2010, noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in the Companys financial statements and income and comprehensive income attributed to the noncontrolling interest will be included in the Companys income and comprehensive income. The provisions of this standard must be applied retrospectively upon adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 160 on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) are effective for the Companys business combinations occurring on or after June 1, 2009. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This provides entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without being required to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2009. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective as of the beginning of the Companys fiscal 2009 for the Companys financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in its consolidated financial statements. The FASB has provided for a one year deferral of the implementation of this standard for other nonfinanical assets and liabilities. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Sales to affiliates (equity method investees) of $4.2 million, $3.8 million, and $2.9 million for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, are included in net sales.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting the Company during fiscal 2008 and 2007 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. These fluctuations impacted raw material and energy costs of all reporting segments, as well as the Companys trading and merchandising activities, which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Companys financial statements. Commodities The Company purchases commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging materials to be used in its operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create gross margin risk. The Company enters into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. The Company has policies governing the hedging instruments its businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of its businesses. The Company also monitors the amount of associated counter party credit risk for all non exchange traded transactions. In addition, the Company, during fiscal 2008 and 2007, purchased and sold certain commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats, natural gas, and crude oil in its trading and merchandising business (presented in discontinued operations). To a lesser extent, the Company engages in wheat trading activities in its milling operations of the Food and Ingredients reporting segment. The Companys trading activities are limited in terms of maximum dollar exposure, as measured by a dollar at risk methodology and monitored to ensure compliance. The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. In practice, as markets move, the Company actively manages its risk and adjusts hedging strategies as appropriate. Fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on the Companys net derivative position by commodity at each quarter end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying commodity positions that are being hedged. The values of commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument.

At the end of fiscal 2008 and 2007, the Company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding. As of May 25, 2008 and May 27, 2007, the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.7 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of May 25, 2008 and May 27, 2007, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $228 million and $253 million, respectively, while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt by approximately $258 million and $288 million, respectively. Foreign Operations In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of its processing and trading operations. This activity primarily relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory, capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis for the Companys processing and trading operations. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in exchange rates. Actual changes in exchange rates may differ from hypothetical changes. Fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was based on the Companys net foreign currency position at each quarter end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying foreign denominated transactions that are being hedged. The currencies hedged have a high inverse correlation to exchange rate changes of the foreign currency derivative instrument.
