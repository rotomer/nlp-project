ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to our financial performance and condition. The discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Results for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future. Executive Overview ConAgra Foods, Inc. (NYSE: CAG) is one of North Americas leading food companies, with brands in 97 percent of Americas households. Consumers find Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Egg Beaters, Healthy Choice, Hebrew National, Hunts, Marie Callenders, Orville Redenbachers, PAM, Peter Pan, Reddi wip, and many other ConAgra Foods brands in grocery, convenience, mass merchandise, and club stores. ConAgra Foods also has a strong business to business presence, supplying potato, other vegetable, spice, and grain products to a variety of well known restaurants, foodservice operators, and commercial customers. Fiscal 2009 diluted earnings per share were $2.15, including $1.42 per diluted share of income from continuing operations and income of $0.73 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Fiscal 2008 diluted earnings per share were $1.90, including income from continuing operations of $1.06 per diluted share and income from discontinued operations of $0.84 per diluted share. Several items affect the comparability of results of continuing operations, as discussed below. Items Impacting Comparability Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2009 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations charges totaling $50 million ($31 million after tax) related to debt refinancing, charges totaling $10 million ($8 million after tax) under our restructuring plans, charges totaling $33 million ($20 million after tax) related to a product recall and associated insurance coverage dispute, a gain of $19 million ($11 million after tax) resulting from the Pemmican beef jerky divestiture, and net tax benefits of approximately $6 million primarily related to changes in estimates. In addition, fiscal 2009 income per share benefited by approximately $.03 as a result of the fiscal year including 53 weeks. Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2008 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations charges totaling $45 million ($28 million after tax) related to product recalls, charges totaling $26 million ($16 million after tax) under our restructuring plans, and net tax benefits of approximately $19 million related to changes in our legal entity structure, favorable settlements, and changes in estimates. Operating Initiatives We continue to execute against our operational improvement initiatives that are intended to generate profitable sales growth, improve profit margins, and expand returns on capital over time. 15 Table of Contents Recent developments in our strategies and action plans include: Pricing initiatives: We implemented price increases across a significant portion of our Consumer Foods portfolio in the latter portion of fiscal 2008 and early fiscal 2009, in response to significant increases in input costs. Although input cost increases moderated during fiscal 2009, we continue to actively monitor these costs and will consider additional pricing actions, as appropriate, to offset input cost increases. Innovation: During fiscal 2009 we continued to benefit from innovation investments. As part of transforming our frozen foods operations and building on our snacks platform, we developed a variety of new products, including Marie Callenders Pasta Al Dente, Healthy Choice All Natural Entres, Healthy Choice Asian Steamers, a renovated Banquet dinner line, and Alexia Natural Crunchy Snacks. In fiscal 2008, we introduced Healthy Choice Caf Steamerstm, Healthy Choice Panini, new flavors of Healthy Choice Soups, Hunts Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes, Orville Redenbachers Smart Pop! Low Sodium, Orville Redenbachers Natural, Chef Boyardee Mac Cheese, PAM Professional, and Fleischmanns and Parkay Soft Spreads to the market. Our Commercial Foods businesses, principally Lamb Weston, ConAgra Mills, and Gilroy Foods Flavors, continue to invest in a variety of new foodservice products and ingredients for foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. Together with additional new products planned for fiscal 2010 and beyond, our new products are expected to contribute to additional sales growth in the future. Sales growth initiatives: We continue to implement sales improvement initiatives focused on penetrating the fastest growing channels, better returns on customer trade arrangements, and optimizing shelf placement for our most profitable products. These, along with marketing initiatives, are intended to generate profitable sales growth. Marketing Initiatives: We have increased our marketing investment to support our brands over the last few years and have added significantly to marketing talent throughout the organization. These changes have dramatically improved the quality of our communication with consumers as well as the strength of our consumer insights and overall execution of marketing plans. We sharpened our focus on marketing effectiveness and have developed a return on investment culture that promotes high returns on incremental marketing investments. Reducing costs throughout the supply chain and the general and administrative functions: As part of a focus on cost reduction, we initiated restructuring plans focused on streamlining our supply chain, reducing selling, general and administrative costs (2006 2008 restructuring plan), and streamlining the Consumer Foods international operations (2008 2009 restructuring plan). We have recognized substantially all of the $269 million of expected costs of these plans as of May 31, 2009. Together, these plans are generating significant annual savings. References to the restructuring plans refer to both the 2006 2008 restructuring plan and the 2008 2009 restructuring plan, unless otherwise noted. In addition to restructuring activities, we have ongoing initiatives focused on supply chain activities (i.e., manufacturing, logistics, and procurement functions), which have resulted in significant cost savings in both fiscal 2008 and 2009. With respect to general and administrative costs, we continue to focus on controlling these costs through driving a zero overhead growth culture throughout the organization. We anticipate this initiative will generate benefits in fiscal 2010 and beyond. Portfolio Strengthening: As part of our continuing efforts to simplify operations, enhance efficiency, and allow greater investment in our core food businesses going forward, we divested several businesses in fiscal 2008 and 2009, including our trading and merchandising operations (fiscal 2009), Pemmican beef jerky business (fiscal 2009), and Knotts Berry Farm jelly and jam business (fiscal 2008). Except for the Pemmican beef jerky business, the results of operations for each of these businesses are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Due to our continuing involvement with the business 16 Table of Contents through providing sales and distribution services to the buyer for a period of up to five years, the results of operations of the Pemmican business have not been reclassified as discontinued operations. We also made strategic investments in fiscal 2008 and 2009 in order to enhance our portfolio. In fiscal 2009, we entered into a potato processing venture, Lamb Weston BSW, with an initial investment of $46 million. We consolidate this venture. In fiscal 2008, we acquired Alexia Foods, Lincoln Snacks, Watts Brothers, and Twin City Foods for a total of approximately $255 million in cash plus assumed liabilities. Dispositions of Businesses Before tax proceeds from the trading and merchandising operations divestiture were comprised of (1) approximately $2.26 billion of cash, net of transaction costs (including incentive compensation amounts due to divested business employees), (2) payment in kind debt securities issued by the purchaser with aggregate principal amount of $550 million, recognized at fair market value of $479 million, and (3) a four year warrant to purchase approximately 5% of the issued common equity of the purchaser, recognized at estimated fair market value of approximately $2 million. We recognized an after tax gain on the divestiture of approximately $301 million. Proceeds from the disposition of the trading and merchandising business were primarily used as follows: 1) to fund a $900 million accelerated share repurchase, 2) to pay down commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 as well as commercial paper borrowings drawn for the purpose of funding working capital needs of the trading and merchandising business just prior to the disposition, and 3) to pay income taxes on the gain resulting from the transaction. Before tax proceeds from the Knotts Berry Farm divestiture were $55 million, with the transaction resulting in no significant gain or loss, while before tax proceeds from the Pemmican divestiture were approximately $29 million and we recognized an after tax gain of approximately $11 million. Capital Allocation In fiscal 2009, we took advantage of a favorable interest rate environment and refinanced a portion of our debt. Specifically, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes ($500 million maturing in 2014 and $500 million maturing in 2019), with an average blended interest rate of approximately 6.4%. With the proceeds from this debt issuance, we repaid approximately $900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and, in the process, paid approximately $50 million ($31 million after tax) of premiums and related transaction fees. In addition, we contributed $100 million to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans. In fiscal 2009, we funded an accelerated share repurchase program totaling $900 million (approximately 44.0 million shares of common stock), utilizing a portion of the proceeds from the trading and merchandising business divestiture. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we executed the following: repayment of $578 million of short term debt; capital expenditures of approximately $442 million; and dividend payments of approximately $348 million. Opportunities and Challenges We believe our operating initiatives will favorably impact future sales, profits, and returns on capital. Because of the scope of change underway, there is risk that these broad change initiatives will not be successfully implemented. Input costs, competitive pressures, the ability to execute operational changes and implement pricing actions, among other factors, will affect the timing and impact of these initiatives. We have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate the higher input costs through pricing and productivity initiatives, and through the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption. We are also focusing on selling, general and administrative cost initiatives, as evidenced by the implementation of our restructuring plans as 17 Table of Contents well as our zero overhead growth initiative. If the benefits from pricing actions, supply chain productivity improvements, economic hedges, and selling, general and administrative cost reduction initiatives are insufficient to cover these expected higher input costs, results of operations, particularly Consumer Foods operating profit, may continue to be negatively impacted. Changing consumer preferences may impact sales of certain of our products. We offer a variety of food products that appeal to a range of consumer preferences and utilize innovation and marketing programs to develop products that fit with changing consumer trends. As part of these programs, we introduce new products and product extensions. Consolidation of many of our customers continues to result in increased buying power, negotiating strength, and complex service requirements for those customers. This trend, which is expected to continue, may negatively impact gross margins, particularly in the Consumer Foods segment. In order to effectively respond to this customer consolidation, we continually evaluate our consumer marketing, sales, and customer service strategies. We are implementing trade promotion programs designed to improve return on investment and pursuing shelf placement and customer service improvement initiatives. The continuing volatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in a variety of ways. Consumers may shift purchases to lower priced private label or other value offerings or may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The financial stability of our customers and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for us or non performance by suppliers. Volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and required pension contributions. Decreased demand in the restaurant business, particularly casual and fine dining, may adversely affect our Commercial Foods operations. Other On June 9, 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina. This facility was the primary production facility for our Slim Jim branded meat snacks. The packaging area of the plant is expected to be out of service for the foreseeable future. On June 13, 2009, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced its determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release, and not a deliberate act. We maintain comprehensive property (including business interruption), workers compensation, and general liability insurance policies with very significant loss limits that we believe will provide substantial and broad coverage for the currently foreseeable losses arising from this accident. We anticipate that we will incur modest costs related to deductibles and co payment obligations under available insurance policies, as well as other one time costs that are not currently expected to be material. SEGMENT REVIEW We report our operations in two reporting segments: Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods. In June 2009, subsequent to our fiscal 2009 year end, we completed the divestiture of the Fernandos foodservice brand for proceeds of approximately $6.4 million. We reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the divested Fernandos business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented. Presentation of Commodity and Foreign Currency Derivative Gains and Losses in Segment Results Prior to fiscal 2008, we designated certain commodity derivative instruments as cash flow hedges qualifying for hedge accounting treatment. We discontinued designating derivatives as cash flow hedges during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, subsequent to the cessation of designating derivatives for hedge accounting 18 Table of Contents treatment, derivative gains and losses were recorded immediately in our segment results as a component of cost of goods sold regardless of when the item being hedged impacted earnings. Following the sale of our trading and merchandising operations and related organizational changes in fiscal 2009, we transferred the management of commodity hedging activities (except for those related to our milling operations) to a centralized procurement group. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we began to reflect realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives (except for those related to our milling operations) used to hedge anticipated commodity consumption in earnings immediately within general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating results in the period in which the underlying item being hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. We believe this change results in better segment management focus on key operational initiatives and improved transparency to derivative gains and losses. In fiscal 2008, we began to centrally manage foreign currency risk for all of our reporting segments. Foreign currency derivatives used to manage foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. As such, these derivatives are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. We believe that these derivatives provide economic hedges of the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions. The following table presents the net derivative losses from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and foreign currency risk for fiscal 2009, under this new methodology (in millions): Net derivative losses incurred $ 80.9 Less: Net derivative losses allocated to reporting segments 75.6 Net derivative losses recognized in general corporate expenses $ 5.3 Net derivative losses allocated to Consumer Foods $ 48.0 Net derivative losses allocated to Commercial Foods 27.6 Net derivative losses included in segment operating profit $ 75.6 Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify losses of $7.8 million and gains of $2.5 million to segment operating results in fiscal 2010 and 2011, respectively. In fiscal 2008, net derivative gains from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and currency risk of our foreign operations were $62.6 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $26.4 million in the Commercial Foods segment. In fiscal 2007, net derivative gains from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and currency risk of our foreign operations were $14.0 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $7.6 million in the Commercial Foods segment. Consumer Foods The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded and private label food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice channels, principally in North America. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf stable temperature classes. The segment is comprised of and managed through five subsegments as described below: Grocery Foods North America includes branded and private label refrigerated or shelf stable food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice channels primarily across the United States. Major brands include: Angela Mia, Chef Boyardee, Egg Beaters, Healthy Choice Fresh Mixerstm, Hebrew National, Hunts, Manwich, PAM, Peter Pan, Snack Pack, Reddi wip, Rosarita, Ro*Tel, Swiss Miss, and Van Camps . The segment also includes the consumer foods businesses in Mexico and Canada, which distribute packaged foods that are both locally manufactured and imported from the United States. 19 Table of Contents Frozen Foods includes branded and private label frozen food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice channels across the United States. Major brands include: Alexia, Banquet, Healthy Choice, Kid Cuisine, and Marie Callenders. Snacks and Store Brands includes branded popcorn, meats, seeds, and specialty snacks, as well as private label food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice channels across the United States.

Products are sold in various retail and foodservice channels across the United States. Major brands include: Blue Bonnet, La Choy, Libbys, The Max, Parkay, and Wesson. Domestic Export includes branded shelf stable food products sold through distributors in various markets throughout the world. The Consumer Foods supply chain and order to cash functions are centrally managed and largely integrated. Accordingly, we do not maintain balance sheets at the subsegment level. Selling, general and administrative expenses, other than advertising and promotion, are managed at the primary segment level, and as such, we do not separately allocate selling, general and administrative expenses other than advertising and promotion expenses to the Consumer Foods subsegments. Commercial Foods The Commercial Foods reporting segment includes commercially branded foods and ingredients, which are sold principally to foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segments primary products include: specialty potato products, milled grain ingredients, a variety of vegetable products, seasonings, blends, and flavors, which are sold under brands such as ConAgra Mills, Lamb Weston, Gilroy Foods Flavorstm, and Spicetec. 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales ($ in millions) Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Reporting Segment Net Sales Net Sales % Increase Consumer Foods Grocery Foods North America $ 2,900 $ 2,694 8 % Frozen Foods 1,877 1,730 8 % Snacks and Store Brands 1,505 1,395 8 % Enabler Brands 1,572 1,427 10 % Domestic Export 182 193 (5 )% Other (5 ) (3 ) NA Total Consumer Foods 8,031 7,436 8 % Commercial Foods 4,700 4,128 14 % Total $ 12,731 $ 11,564 10 % Overall, our net sales increased $1.17 billion to $12.73 billion in fiscal 2009, reflecting improved pricing and mix in the Consumer Foods segment and increased pricing in the milling and specialty potato operations of the Commercial Foods segment. Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2009 were $8.03 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected an increase of 7% from improved net pricing and product mix, and flat volume. Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of an additional week of results. The strengthening 20 Table of Contents of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies resulted in a reduction of net sales of approximately 1% as compared to fiscal 2008. Highlights by subsegment are as follows: Grocery Foods North America Grocery Foods North America net sales were $2.90 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2008.

We achieved sales growth in fiscal 2009 for Crunch N Munch, DAVID, Orville Redenbachers, and Slim Jim. Sales of ACT II declined in fiscal 2009. The decrease in ACT II volume reflected the elimination of certain low margin sales in favor of more focus behind higher margin Orville Redenbachers popcorn. Enabler Brands Enabler Brands net sales were $1.57 billion, an increase of 10% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected net pricing and mix improvement of approximately 11%, partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of an additional week of results. We achieved sales growth in fiscal 2009 for the following brands: Blue Bonnet, La Choy, Libbys, The Max, Van Camps, and Wesson. These increases were offset by sales declines in Pemmican. Domestic Export Domestic Export net sales were $182 million, a decrease of 5% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected net pricing and mix improvement of 7%, which was more than offset by a 12% decline in volume, reflecting our exit from a number of international markets in fiscal 2009. Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of an additional week of results. Commercial Foods net sales were $4.70 billion in fiscal 2009, an increase of $572 million, or 14% compared to fiscal 2008. Increased net sales reflected the pass through of higher wheat prices by the segments flour milling operations and higher selling prices in our Lamb Weston specialty potato products business, partially offset by lower foodservice volumes for our potato products. Results reflected a benefit of approximately 2% due to the inclusion of an additional week in fiscal 2009. Net sales from Watts Brothers and Lamb Weston BSW, businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the second quarter of fiscal 2009, respectively, contributed $119 million to net sales in fiscal 2009. 21 Table of Contents Profit Contribution Margin (PCM) (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold and Advertising and Promotion Expense) ($ in millions) Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 % Increase/ Reporting Segment PCM PCM (Decrease) Consumer Foods Grocery Foods North America $ 729 $ 685 6 % Frozen Foods 349 326 7 % Snacks and Store Brands 324 294 10 % Enabler Brands 215 228 (5 )% Domestic Export 47 35 34 % Other (7 ) 57 NA Total Consumer Foods 1,657 1,625 2 % Commercial Foods 789 709 11 % Consumer Foods PCM for fiscal 2009 was $1.66 billion, an increase of $32 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in PCM reflected improved net pricing and mix and significant supply chain productivity savings, partially offset by significantly higher input costs in all subsegments. Consumer Foods PCM in fiscal 2008 included approximately $28 million of costs related to the recalls of pot pie and peanut butter products. Highlights by subsegment are as follows: Grocery Foods North America Grocery Foods North America PCM was $729 million, an increase of 6% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected increased volume of 3%, increased net pricing that more than offset higher input costs, and significant supply chain savings. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies resulted in a reduction of PCM of approximately $17 million, net of the benefit of economic foreign currency hedges. Advertising and promotion costs were $14 million higher in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008. PCM included costs of $6 million related to the peanut butter recall in fiscal 2008. Frozen Foods Frozen Foods PCM was $349 million, an increase of 7% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected increased volume of 5% and improved pricing and mix that more than offset higher input costs. Advertising and promotion costs were $16 million higher in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008. PCM included costs of $21 million related to the pot pie recall in fiscal 2008. Snacks and Store Brands Snacks and Store Brands PCM was $324 million, an increase of 10% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected decreased volume of 7% and improved pricing and mix that more than offset higher input costs. The improvement in PCM, despite the decrease in volume reflects the elimination of certain low margin ACT II sales in favor of more focus behind higher margin Orville Redenbachers popcorn. Enabler Brands Enabler Brands PCM was $215 million, a decrease of 5% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected decreased volume of 1%. Increases in net pricing were more than offset by the impact of higher input costs across the portfolio of brands, primarily due to an increase in the cost of edible oils. Domestic Export Domestic Export PCM was $47 million, an increase of 34% compared to fiscal 2008. Results reflected decreased volume of 12%. The impact of improved net pricing and mix was more than offset by the impact of higher input costs. Fiscal 2009 PCM was also favorably impacted by a $9 million decrease in advertising and promotion expense. 22 Table of Contents Other Other Consumer Foods PCM included $48 million and $63 million of realized and unrealized net losses and gains, respectively, on derivative instruments used to economically hedge anticipated commodity input costs in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Commercial Foods PCM was $789 million for fiscal 2009, an increase of $80 million, or 11%, compared to fiscal 2008. All major businesses in this segment experienced significantly higher input costs in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008 and increased pricing to offset these higher costs. Improved results reflected increased PCM of $25 million in our flour milling operations due to high quality wheat crops and improved flour conversion margins. Our Lamb Weston specialty potato business achieved increased PCM of $46 million in fiscal 2009, reflecting PCM of $28 million from the Watts Brothers business acquired in late fiscal 2008 and the Lamb Weston BSW business acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as increased pricing that more than offset increased input costs and lower volume. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SGA) SGA expenses totaled $1.69 billion for fiscal 2009, a decrease of 4% compared to fiscal 2008. We estimate that the inclusion of an extra week in the fiscal 2009 results increased SGA expenses by approximately 2%. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 reflected the following: a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $53 million, a charge of $49 million representing the net premium and fees paid to retire certain debt instruments prior to maturity, a decrease in pension expense of $18 million, a decrease in postretirement expense of $8 million, a charge of $25 million related to a coverage dispute with an insurer, a gain of $19 million from the sale of the Pemmican brand, a decrease in stock compensation expense of $17 million, an increase in salaries expense of $11 million, charges related to peanut butter and pot pie recalls of $11 million, charges of $10 million related to the execution of our restructuring plans, $5 million of income, net of direct pass through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses, a gain of $5 million on the sale of a facility in our Commercial Foods segment, and an increase in advertising and promotion expense of $5 million. Included in SGA expenses for fiscal 2008 were the following items: charges of $22 million related to the execution of our restructuring plans, charges related to product recalls of $21 million, and $14 million of income, net of direct pass through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses. 23 Table of Contents Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Operating Operating % Increase/ Reporting Segment Profit Profit (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 956 $ 830 15 % Commercial Foods 584 512 14 % Consumer Foods operating profit increased $126 million in fiscal 2009 versus the prior year to $956 million. The increase was reflective of the increased PCM, discussed above, and was influenced by a number of factors, including: restructuring costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses of $8 million and $19 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively, costs of the product recalls classified in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $11 million and $21 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively, a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $21 million, and a gain of approximately $19 million related to the sale of the Pemmican brand. Commercial Foods operating profit increased $72 million to $584 million in fiscal 2009. Operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved PCM, as discussed above. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2009, net interest expense was $186 million, a decrease of $67 million, or 26%, from fiscal 2008. The reduction in net interest expense reflects interest income of $78 million in fiscal 2009, largely due to the payment in kind notes received in June 2008 in connection with the divestiture of our trading and merchandising operations. Equity Method Investment Earnings We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our equity method investments were $24 million ($3 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $21 million in the Commercial Foods segment) and $50 million ($1 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $49 million in the Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in equity method investment earnings in Commercial Foods was driven by the reduced profits of a foreign potato venture, resulting primarily from excess supply of potato products in the ventures market. Results of Discontinued Operations Our discontinued operations generated after tax earnings of $332 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the trading and merchandising operations and recognized an after tax gain on the disposition of approximately $301 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we made a decision to sell certain small foodservice brands. The sale of these brands was completed in June 2009, subsequent to our fiscal 2009. We recognized after tax impairment charges of $6 million in anticipation of this divestiture. Our discontinued operations generated after tax earnings of $412 million in fiscal 2008. 24 Table of Contents Income Taxes and Net Income Our income tax expense was $337 million in fiscal 2009. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2008, we adjusted our estimates of income taxes payable due to increased benefits from a domestic manufacturing deduction and lower foreign income taxes, resulting in a lower than normal effective tax rate of 30%. The Company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal 2010, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Net income was $978 million, or $2.15 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009, compared to $931 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales ($ in millions) Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Reporting Segment Net Sales Net Sales % Increase Consumer Foods Grocery Foods North America $ 2,694 $ 2,563 5 % Frozen Foods 1,730 1,660 4 % Snacks and Store Brands 1,395 1,383 1 % Enabler Brands 1,427 1,293 10 % Domestic Export 193 168 15 % Other (3 ) 1 NA Total Consumer Foods 7,436 7,068 5 % Commercial Foods 4,128 3,422 21 % Total $ 11,564 $ 10,490 10 % Overall, our net sales increased $1.07 billion to $11.56 billion in fiscal 2008, reflecting increased pricing in the milling and specialty potato operations of the Commercial Foods segment and increased volume and pricing in the Consumer Foods segment. Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2008 were $7.44 billion, an increase of 5% compared to fiscal 2007. Results reflect an increase of three percentage points from improved net pricing and product mix and two percentage points of improvement from higher volumes. We initiated a peanut butter recall in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and reintroduced Peter Pan peanut butter products in August 2007. Sales of all peanut butter products, including both branded and private label, in fiscal 2008 were $14 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007. Consumer Foods net sales were also adversely impacted by the recall of Banquet and private label pot pies in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Net sales of pot pies were lower by approximately $22 million in fiscal 2008, relative to fiscal 2007, primarily due to product returns and lost sales of Banquet and private label pot pies. Highlights by subsegment are as follows: Grocery Foods North America Grocery Foods North America net sales were $2.69 billion, an increase of 5% compared to fiscal 2007. Results reflected increased sales of approximately 4% due to volume and mix. The strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for approximately 1% of the increase in sales. Net pricing was essentially flat. Net sales of some of the subsegments most significant brands, including Chef Boyardee, Egg Beaters, Hebrew National, Hunts, Manwich, Ro*Tel, Rosarita, and Snack Pack, grew in fiscal 2008. Sales of Reddi wip and Swiss Miss declined in fiscal 2008. 25 Table of Contents Frozen Foods Frozen Foods net sales were $1.73 billion, an increase of 4% compared to fiscal 2007. Results reflected increased sales of approximately 2% due to volume and mix and net pricing increases of approximately 2%. Sales of Healthy Choice and Marie Callenders branded products increased, offset by net sales declines in the Banquet and Kid Cuisine product lines. Net sales from the Alexia business, acquired in fiscal 2008, resulted in an increase of $35 million in net sales in fiscal 2008. Banquet net sales were lower by $10 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to the pot pie recall. Snacks and Store Brands Snacks and Store Brands net sales were $1.40 billion, an increase of 1% compared to fiscal 2007. Results reflected decreased sales of approximately 1% from lower volume and mix, offset by improved net pricing of approximately 2%. Sales of the Orville Redenbachers brand increased, offset by sales declines in ACT II, Pemmican, and Slim Jim. Net sales from the Lincoln Snacks business, acquired during fiscal 2008, resulted in a $30 million increase as compared to fiscal 2007. The peanut butter and pot pie recalls, which included store brands, negatively impacted this subsegments net sales by $23 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Enabler Brands Enabler Brands net sales were $1.43 billion, an increase of 10% compared to fiscal 2007. Results reflect increases of approximately 7% due to net pricing and approximately 3% due to volume and mix. Sales of Wesson, Blue Bonnet, Libbys, Wolf, and The Max brands increased. These increases were offset by net sales declines in Angela Mia and Parkay. A refrigerated pizza business, sold during fiscal 2007, generated sales of $17 million in fiscal 2007. Domestic Export Domestic Export net sales were $193 million, an increase of 15% compared to fiscal 2007. These results reflected a 15% increase principally due to volume and mix. The net pricing impact was flat. Commercial Foods net sales were $4.13 billion in fiscal 2008, an increase of $706 million, or 21%. Increased sales are reflective of higher sales prices in our milling operations due to higher grain prices, and price and volume increases in our specialty potato and dehydrated vegetable operations. The fiscal 2007 divestiture of an oat milling operation resulted in a reduction of sales of $27 million for fiscal 2008, partially offset by increased sales of $18 million from the acquisition of Watts Brothers in February 2008. Profit Contribution Margin (PCM) (Net Sales less Cost of Goods Sold and Advertising and Promotion Expense) ($ in millions) Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 % Increase/ Reporting Segment PCM PCM (Decrease) Consumer Foods Grocery Foods North America $ 685 $ 768 (11 )% Frozen Foods 326 330 (1 )% Snacks and Store Brands 294 343 (14 )% Enabler Brands 228 283 (19 )% Domestic Export 35 27 30 % Other 57 (64 ) NA Total Consumer Foods 1,625 1,687 (4 )% Commercial Foods 709 578 23 % Consumer Foods PCM for fiscal 2008 was $1.63 billion, a decrease of $62 million, or 4%, from the prior year. The decrease in PCM reflected significantly higher input costs, partially offset by improved net pricing, mix, and volume. The increased input costs were partially offset by productivity improvements and gains on derivatives held 26 Table of Contents to economically hedge current and future input costs. The factors impacting comparability of Consumer Foods net sales also impact the comparability of Consumer Foods PCM. Due to the peanut butter recall that was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the subsequent reintroduction of Peter Pan peanut butter products in August 2007, PCM in the Consumer Foods segment is not comparable across periods. Consumer Foods PCM from all peanut butter products, including both branded and private label, in fiscal 2008 was $23 million lower than comparable amounts in fiscal 2007. Consumer Foods PCM on Banquet and private label pot pies products were lower by approximately $22 million in fiscal 2008, relative to fiscal 2007, primarily due to product returns and lost sales. Newly acquired businesses contributed $13 million to PCM in fiscal 2008. Costs of implementing our restructuring plans reduced Consumer Foods PCM for fiscal 2008 and 2007 by $4 million and $45 million, respectively. Highlights by subsegment are as follows: Grocery Foods North America Grocery Foods North America PCM was $685 million, a decrease of 11%. Increased sales were offset by higher input costs across the portfolio of brands that decreased PCM by approximately 19%. Advertising and promotion costs were in line with prior year levels. The change in PCM includes a benefit of approximately $11 million due to favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes. Peter Pan PCM was lower by $21 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the peanut butter recall that was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Peter Pan peanut butter products were reintroduced in August 2007, affecting the year over year results of the operations. Frozen Foods Frozen Foods PCM was $326 million, a decrease of 1%. The impact of increased sales and lower advertising and promotion expense was more than offset by higher input costs across the portfolio of brands. Banquet PCM was lower by $17 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the pot pie recall. Snacks and Store Brands Snacks and Store Brands PCM was $294 million, a decrease of 14%. Increases due to the impact of higher sales and lower advertising and promotion expense were more than offset by higher input costs across the portfolio of brands. The peanut butter and pot pie recalls, which included store brands, negatively impacted this subsegments PCM by $7 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Enabler Brands Enabler Brands PCM was $228 million, a decrease of 19%. Increases in net sales were more than offset by the impact of higher input costs across the portfolio of brands, primarily due to the increase in cost of edible oils. Advertising and promotion expense was in line with prior year levels. Domestic Export Domestic Export PCM was $35 million, an increase of 30%. The impact of increased sales was offset by the impact of input costs. Fiscal 2008 PCM was also favorably impacted by a decrease in advertising and promotion expense. Other Consumer Foods PCM for fiscal 2008 principally includes net gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs, partially offset by restructuring and other expenses not allocated directly to subsegments. For fiscal 2007, Other Consumer Foods PCM principally includes restructuring costs and other expenses not allocated directly to subsegments, partially offset by net gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs. These amounts are not reflected in subsequent PCM results. Commercial Foods PCM was $709 million for fiscal 2008, an increase of $131 million, or 23%, over the prior year. Improved results reflected increased PCM of $68 million in our milling operations due to a favorable wheat commodity environment and improved flour conversion margins. We also achieved an increase in PCM of $61 million in our specialty potato business as benefits from pricing, volume growth, and product mix management exceeded the impact of higher input costs. Results also reflected gains on derivatives held to economically hedge current and future input costs as well as profits from wheat derivatives trading. 27 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SGA) SGA expenses totaled $1.76 billion for fiscal 2008, virtually unchanged from the prior fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2008 reflected the following: a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of $58 million, an increase in salaries expense of $45 million, a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $41 million, charges of $22 million related to the execution of our restructuring plans, charges related to product recalls of $21 million, $14 million of income, net of direct pass through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses, and a decrease in charitable contributions of $12 million. Included in SGA expenses for fiscal 2007 were the following items: charges of $57 million related to our restructuring plans, charges related to the peanut butter recall of $36 million, $23 million of income, net of direct pass through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses, gains of $27 million related to the disposition of an oat milling business, certain international licensing rights for a small brand, and four corporate aircraft, a benefit of $13 million for favorable legal settlements, and a benefit of $7 million related to a favorable resolution of franchise tax matters. Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense, net, income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Operating Operating % Increase/ Reporting Segment Profit Profit (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 830 $ 911 (9 )% Commercial Foods 512 435 18 % Consumer Foods operating profit decreased $81 million in fiscal 2008 versus the prior fiscal year to $830 million. The decrease for the fiscal year was reflective of the decreased PCM, discussed above, and was influenced by a number of factors, including: restructuring costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses of $19 million and $40 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, costs of the product recalls classified in selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately $21 million and $36 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, a $23 million decrease in transition services reimbursement income, net of direct pass through costs, related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, similar reimbursement income of $14 million is reflected in general corporate expenses and did not impact operating profit, and a gain of approximately $4 million related to the sale of certain international licensing rights. 28 Table of Contents Commercial Foods operating profit increased $77 million to $512 million in fiscal 2008. Operating profit improvement was principally driven by the improved PCM, as discussed above. Other factors affecting the increased operating profit included higher selling expense and compensation costs in fiscal 2008, and gains recorded in fiscal 2007 of $18 million related to our sale of an oat milling business and $8 million resulting from a legal settlement related to a fire. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2008, net interest expense was $253 million, an increase of $34 million, or 15%, over the prior fiscal year. Increased interest expense reflected our use of commercial paper to finance higher working capital balances in all segments, particularly in the trading and merchandising business which is now presented within discontinued operations. We also earned less interest income due to lower balances of cash on hand in fiscal 2008. Equity Method Investment Earnings We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our equity method investments was $50 million ($1 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $49 million in the Commercial Foods segment) and $28 million ($2 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $26 million in the Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in equity method investment earnings in Commercial Foods was driven by improved performance of a foreign potato venture. Results of Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations was $412 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2008. Included in these amounts are: pre tax earnings of $669 million, largely the result of very strong profits from the fertilizer, agricultural merchandising, energy trading, and agricultural trading operations of the trading and merchandising business, and income tax expense of $257 million. Income from discontinued operations was $283 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2007. Included in these amounts are: pre tax earnings of $459 million from operations of discontinued businesses, largely the result of strong profits from the trading of fertilizer and crude oil in the trading and merchandising business, a pre tax curtailment gain of $9 million related to postretirement benefits of the packaged meats operations divested in fiscal 2007, and an $8 million gain related to a legal settlement in connection with the packaged meats operations, impairment charges of $21 million based on the final negotiations related to the sale of the packaged meats operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, a gain of $64 million primarily from the disposition of our packaged cheese business and a dietary supplement business, and income tax expense of $176 million. Income Taxes and Net Income The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 30% for fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we adjusted our estimates of income taxes payable due to increased benefits from a domestic manufacturing deduction and lower foreign income taxes, resulting in a lower than normal effective tax rate. These impacts and tax benefits related to a change in the legal structure of our subsidiaries are the primary contributors to the decrease in the year to date effective tax rate from fiscal 2007. 29 Table of Contents The effective tax rate was 34% in fiscal 2007. In 2007, state income taxes included approximately $24 million of benefits related to the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in estimates, principally related to state tax jurisdictions. These benefits were offset by the tax impact of an Internal Revenue Service audit settlement. Net income was $931 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008, compared to $765 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital Our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. We currently use short term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities) and a combination of equity and long term debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets. Commercial paper borrowings (usually less than 30 days maturity) are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets within notes payable. At May 31, 2009, we had a $1.5 billion multi year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions which matures in December 2011. The multi year facility has historically been used solely as a back up facility for our commercial paper program. As of May 31, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. Borrowings under the multi year facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. The multi year facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65% of our consolidated capital base, and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. As of the end of fiscal 2009, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants. As of the end of fiscal 2009, our senior long term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes ($500 million maturing in 2014 and $500 million maturing in 2019), with an average blended interest rate of approximately 6.4%. We subsequently repaid approximately $900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with maturities of 2010, 2011, and 2027. We incurred charges of $50 million for the premium paid and transaction costs associated with the debt retirement. We also contributed $100 million to our pension plans in order to improve the funded status of the plans. We have repurchased our shares of common stock from time to time based on repurchase limits authorized by our Board of Directors and market conditions. During fiscal 2008 we repurchased $188 million of our shares. During fiscal 2009, we executed an accelerated share repurchase, buying back approximately 44 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $900 million. At May 31, 2009, our current share repurchase authorization was essentially exhausted. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we sold our trading and merchandising operations for proceeds of: 1) approximately $2.2 billion in cash, net of transaction costs, 2) $550 million (face value) of payment in kind debt securities issued by the purchaser (the Notes) which was recorded at an initial estimated fair value of $479 million, 3) a short term receivable of $37 million due from the purchaser (which was subsequently collected), and 4) a four year warrant to acquire approximately 5% of the issued common equity of the parent company of the divested operations, which has been recorded at an estimated fair value of $1.8 million. The Notes, which are classified as other assets, had a carrying value of $522 million at May 31, 2009. 30 Table of Contents Cash Flows In fiscal 2009, we generated $72 million of cash, which was the net result of $124 million generated from operating activities, $1.79 billion generated from investing activities, and $1.83 billion used in financing activities. Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $978 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to $371 million generated in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, cash flows from income of continuing operations were largely absorbed by increased working capital requirements, particularly due to increased quantities and unit costs of inventory. In fiscal 2009, improved income from continuing operations and working capital management efforts resulted in significantly improved cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations. Specifically, we improved the speed of our collection of accounts receivable and converted derivative positions used in our economic hedging activities to cash, which more than offset the increase in crop based inventory balances in our Commercial Foods businesses. The increased inventory balances in our Commercial Foods businesses are largely due to the purchase of strong potato and garlic crops, coupled with lower demand in the foodservice channel. We also contributed $112 million to our Company sponsored pension plans in fiscal 2009. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was $854 million in fiscal 2009, primarily due to the increase in commodity inventory balances and derivative assets in the trading and merchandising business during the brief period we held that business prior to its divestiture in June 2008. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations was $278 million in fiscal 2008. Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled $467 million in fiscal 2009 and $676 million in fiscal 2008. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2009 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $442 million and acquisitions of businesses (including Lamb Weston BSW) and intangible assets totaling $84 million, partially offset by sales of businesses (including the Pemmican business) and fixed assets. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of expenditures of $255 million related to the acquisition of businesses (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and capital expenditures of $489 million, which included approximately $39 million of expenditures related to the purchase of certain warehouse facilities from our lessors (these warehouses were sold for proceeds of approximately $36 million to unrelated third parties immediately thereafter), offset by $30 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. We generated $2.26 billion of cash from investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2009 from the disposition of the trading and merchandising business. We generated $32 million from investing activities from discontinued operations in fiscal 2008, primarily from the sale of the Knotts Berry Farm jams and jellies brand and operations. Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.83 billion in fiscal 2009, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $22 million in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased $900 million of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program, we reduced our short term borrowings by $578 million, and paid dividends of $348 million. We refinanced certain of our long term debt in fiscal 2009, issuing $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes ($500 million maturing in 2014 and $500 million maturing in 2019.) We repaid $950 million aggregate principal amount of senior and subordinated notes throughout the year (net losses of $49 million on the retirement of debt are also reflected as financing cash outflows). During fiscal 2008, we repurchased $188 million of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program and paid dividends of $362 million. As part of the Watts Brothers acquisition, we repaid $64 million of assumed long term debt subsequent to the acquisition. In addition to these early retirements of debt, we made scheduled principal payments of debt and payments of lease financing obligations during fiscal 2008, reducing long term debt by $21 million. Also, during fiscal 2008, we increased our short term borrowings by $577 million, primarily reflecting the financing of significantly increased working capital. We estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 will be approximately $475 million. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months. 31 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We use off balance sheet arrangements (e.g., operating leases) where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use. We periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in Obligations and Commitments, below. In September 2008, we formed a potato processing venture, Lamb Weston BSW, with Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. We provide all sales and marketing services to the venture. We have determined that Lamb Weston BSW is a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial statements of Lamb Weston BSW. We also consolidate the assets and liabilities of several entities from which we lease corporate aircraft. Each of these entities has been determined to be a variable interest entity and we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of these entities. Due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities, we reflected in our balance sheets: May 31, May 25, 2009 2008 Cash $ 1.2 $ Receivables, net 12.6 Inventories 3.1 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 0.1 Property, plant and equipment, net 100.5 51.8 Goodwill 18.6 Brands, trademarks and other intangibles, net 10.6 Total assets $ 146.7 $ 51.8 Current installments of long term debt $ 6.1 $ 3.3 Accounts payable 4.3 Accrued payroll 0.2 Other accrued liabilities 0.7 0.6 Senior long term debt, excluding current installments 83.3 50.9 Other noncurrent liabilities (minority interest) 27.3 Total liabilities $ 121.9 $ 54.8 The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these entities do not represent additional claims on the general assets of the Company. The creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities to which they have advanced credit. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as take or pay contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in our normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt and capital lease obligations, which totaled $3.6 billion as of May 31, 2009, were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled approximately $1.0 billion as of May 31, 2009, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. 32 Table of Contents A summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2009 was as follows (including obligations of discontinued operations): Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Less than After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Years Long term debt $ 3,540.5 $ 10.4 $ 615.7 $ 538.1 $ 2,376.3 Capital lease obligations 65.9 5.0 8.4 5.8 46.7 Operating lease obligations 366.3 64.2 110.6 74.8 116.7 Purchase obligations 644.7 459.2 167.5 9.6 8.4 Total $ 4,617.4 $ 538.8 $ 902.2 $ 628.3 $ 2,548.1 We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted average interest rate of the long term debt obligations outstanding as of May 31, 2009 was approximately 7.0%. We consolidate the assets and liabilities of certain entities that have been determined to be variable interest entities and for which we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of these entities. The amounts reflected in contractual obligations of long term debt, in the table above, include $89 million of liabilities of these variable interest entities to the creditors of such entities. The long term debt recognized as a result of consolidating these entities does not represent additional claims on our general assets. The creditors of these entities have claims only on the assets of the specific variable interest entities. As of May 31, 2009, we were obligated to make rental payments of $60 million to the variable interest entities, of which $7 million is due in less than one year, $23 million is due in one to three years, and $30 million is due in three to five years. Such amounts are not reflected in the table above. The purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect approximately $474 million of open purchase orders, some of which are not legally binding. These purchase orders will be settled in the ordinary course of business in less than one year. As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantee debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. A summary of our commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2009, was as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period ($ in millions) Less than After 5 Other Commercial Commitments Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Years Guarantees $ 88.6 $ 45.7 $ 7.1 $ 5.4 $ 30.4 Other Commitments 0.4 0.4 Total $ 89.0 $ 46.1 $ 7.1 $ 5.4 $ 30.4 In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We have outstanding guarantees of certain railcar leases of the divested trading and merchandising business (now operating as the Gavilon Group, LLC (Gavilon)); the railcar leases were in place prior to the divestiture and the parties are working with the lessors to secure our release. The remaining terms of these lease agreements do not exceed two years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was $3 million as of May 31, 2009. We have not established a liability for these guarantees, which are included in the table above, as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote. We guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations resulting from our fresh beef and pork divestiture. The remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed seven years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was approximately $18 million as of May 31, 2009. We have also 33 Table of Contents guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs. We are a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have guaranteed repayment of short term bank loans of the potato suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 31, 2009, the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was approximately $40 million, included in the table above. We have not established a liability for these guarantees, as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote. We are a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing company. We have guaranteed repayment of a loan of this supplier, under certain conditions. At May 31, 2009, the amount of this loan was $25 million, included in the table above. In the event of default on this loan by the supplier, we have the contractual right to purchase the loan from the lender, thereby giving us the rights to underlying collateral. We have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee, as we believe the likelihood of financial exposure to us under this agreement is remote. The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for income taxes under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (as amended), as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 31, 2009 was $75 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management. Our Audit Committee has reviewed managements development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates. Marketing Costs We incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs, which include advertising, retailer incentives, and consumer incentives. We recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For volume based incentives provided to retailers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the retailer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these factors change, managements estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time. In fiscal 2009, we entered into approximately 120,000 individual marketing programs with customers, resulting in annual costs in excess of $2.5 billion, which are reflected as a reduction of net sales. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any of the individual customer marketing programs would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows. Advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled $399 million, $393 million, and $451 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Income Taxes Our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is 34 Table of Contents required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. Management reviews our tax positions quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. Management uses historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third party specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities. Management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible parties, and our experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. Managements estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change. We have recognized a reserve of approximately $89 million for environmental liabilities as of May 31, 2009. Historically, the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy. Employment Related Benefits We incur certain employment related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers compensation. In order to measure the expense associated with these employment related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. We recognized pension expense from Company plans of $38 million, $56 million, and $75 million in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, which reflected expected returns on plan assets of $159 million, $149 million, and $134 million, respectively. We contributed $112 million, $8 million, and $172 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $34 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2010. One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. We select a discount rate each year (as of our fiscal year end measurement date for fiscal 2008 and thereafter) for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year by year projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. The hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moodys Aa) available at the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount rate 35 Table of Contents selected by us for determination of pension expense was 6.6% for fiscal year 2009 and 5.75% for fiscal 2008 and 2007. We selected a discount rate of 6.9% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2010. A 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $1.4 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by $1.5 million for the year. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately $1.6 million for fiscal 2010. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately $1.7 million for fiscal 2010. For our year end pension obligation determination, we selected a discount rate of 6.9% and 6.6% for fiscal year 2009 and 2008, respectively. Another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plans investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, we selected 7.75% for the long term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2009 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $5 million. We selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2010. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $5 million. When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans, we use a market related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and expected return) over five years. The market related value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2009 was $266 million lower than the actual fair value of plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. We determine this assumption based on our long term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. Based on this information, we selected 4.25% for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 as the rate of compensation increase for determining our year end pension obligation. We selected 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007. A 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. We selected a rate of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2010. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would increase/decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. We recognized postretirement benefit expense of $15 million, $23 million, and $10 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We reflected liabilities of $281 million and $378 million in our balance sheets as of May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $34 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2010. The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 6.4% for fiscal year 2009 and 5.5% for fiscal 2008 and 2007. We have selected a discount rate of 6.6% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2010. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans. We have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 8.5%, with the trend rate 36 Table of Contents decreasing to 5.5% by 2013. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect: One Percent One Percent ($ in millions) Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost $ 1 $ (1 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 18 (17 ) We provide workers compensation benefits to our employees. The measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation. The discount rate used at May 31, 2009 was 4.2%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense. Impairment of Long Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets We reduce the carrying amounts of long lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long lived assets, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets. We utilize a relief from royalty methodology in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. When determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. Estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and consumer trends. In determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital. As the calculated fair value of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). This statement amends FIN 46(R) to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The provisions of this statement are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal 2011. Earlier application is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No. 167. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities. FSP EITF 03 6 1 requires that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and must be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two class method. FSP EITF 03 6 1 is effective as of 37 Table of Contents the beginning of our fiscal 2010. We do not expect the adoption of this FSP to have a material impact on our financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB No. 51. This statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Upon its adoption, effective as of the beginning of our fiscal 2010, noncontrolling interests will be classified as equity in our financial statements and income and comprehensive income attributed to the noncontrolling interest will be included in our income and comprehensive income. The provisions of this standard must be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements. The presentation and disclosure requirements of this standard must be applied retrospectively upon adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 160 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) are effective for our business combinations occurring on or after June 1, 2009. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Sales to affiliates (equity method investees) of $1.6 million, $4.2 million, and $3.8 million for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, were included in net sales. We received management fees from affiliates of $17.8 million, $16.3 million, and $14.8 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Accounts receivable from affiliates totaled $2.7 million and $3.2 million at May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, respectively, of which $3.0 million was included in current assets held for sale at May 25, 2008. Accounts payable to affiliates totaled $14.3 million and $15.6 million at May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we sold an aircraft for proceeds of approximately $8.1 million to a company on whose board of directors one of the Companys directors sits. We recognized a gain of approximately $3.0 million on the transaction. From time to time, one of our business units has engaged an environmental and agricultural engineering services firm. The firm is a subsidiary of an entity whose chief executive officer serves on our Board of Directors. Payments to this firm for environmental and agricultural engineering services and structures acquired totaled $0.4 million in each of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2009 and 2008 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. These fluctuations impacted raw material and energy costs of all reporting segments, as well as our trading and merchandising activities, which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our financial statements. Commodities We purchase commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging materials to be used in our operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of associated counter party credit risk for all non exchange traded transactions. In addition, during our ownership of the trading and merchandising business (divested during quarter one of fiscal 2009), we purchased and sold certain commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats, natural gas, and crude oil (presented in discontinued operations). The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. In practice, as markets move, we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging strategies as appropriate. Fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was based on our net derivative position by commodity at each quarter end during the fiscal year. The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying commodity positions that are being hedged. The values of commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price changes of the derivative commodity instrument.

At the end of fiscal 2009 and 2008, we did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding. As of May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.7 billion, based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of May 31, 2009 and May 25, 2008, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $196 million and $228 million, respectively, while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $307 million and $258 million, respectively. Foreign Operations In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our processing operations. This activity primarily relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory, capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. 39 Table of Contents The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis for our processing operations. Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in exchange rates. Actual changes in exchange rates may differ from hypothetical changes. Fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was based on our net foreign currency position at each quarter end during the fiscal year.
