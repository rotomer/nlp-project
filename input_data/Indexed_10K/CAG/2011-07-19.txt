ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to our financial performance and condition. The discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Results for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future. Executive Overview ConAgra Foods, Inc. (NYSE: CAG) is one of North Americas leading food companies, with brands in 97% of Americas households. Consumers find Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Egg Beaters, Healthy Choice, Hebrew National, Hunts, Marie Callenders, Orville Redenbachers, PAM, Peter Pan, Reddi wip, and many other ConAgra Foods brands in grocery, convenience, mass merchandise, and club stores. We also have a strong business to business presence, supplying frozen potato and sweet potato products, as well as other vegetable, spice, and grain products to a variety of well known restaurants, foodservice operators, and commercial customers. Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share were $1.88, including $1.90 per diluted share of income from continuing operations and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share were $1.62, including income from continuing operations of $1.66 per diluted share and a loss of $0.04 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Several significant items affect the comparability of year over year results of continuing operations (see Items Impacting Comparability below). Items Impacting Comparability Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2011 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations a gain of $105 million ($66 million after tax) from the settlement of an insurance claim related to the Garner accident, charges totaling $56 million ($35 million after tax) under our restructuring plans, and a gain of $25 million ($16 million after tax) from the receipt, as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining payment in kind notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009 (the Notes), in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. Reported within Discontinued Operations Losses totaling $22 million ($14 million after tax) due to the write down of the carrying value of the assets of a small business. Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2010 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations charges totaling $40 million ($25 million after tax) under our restructuring plans, charges totaling $33 million ($21 million after tax) related to an impairment of a partially completed production facility, a benefit of $15 million ($9 million after tax) from a favorable adjustment relating to an environmental liability, charges totaling $14 million ($9 million after tax) for transaction related costs associated with securing federal tax benefits related to the Delhi, LA sweet potato production facility, a gain of $14 million ($9 million after tax) from the sale of the Lucks brand, and a benefit of $20 million from a lower than planned income tax rate. 16 Table of Contents Reported within Discontinued Operations Charges totaling $59 million ($40 million after tax) primarily representing a write down of the carrying value of the assets of the Companys discontinued dehydrated vegetable operations. Settlement of Insurance Claim related to Garner, North Carolina Accident On June 9, 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina (the Garner accident). This facility was the primary production facility for our Slim Jim branded meat snacks. On June 13, 2009, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced its determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental natural gas release, and not a deliberate act. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we reached a settlement of this matter with our insurance providers, and we recognized a gain, net of fiscal 2011 expenditures related to this matter, of approximately $105 million. The costs incurred and insurance recoveries recognized, in fiscal 2011 and 2010, are reflected in our consolidated financial statements, as follows: Year Ended May 29, 2011 Year Ended May 30, 2010 Consumer Consumer Foods Corporate Total Foods Corporate Total Cost of goods sold: Inventory write downs and other costs $ 1 $ $ 1 $ 12 $ $ 12 Selling, general and administrative expenses: Fixed asset impairments, clean up costs, etc. $ 3 $ $ 3 $ 47 $ 3 $ 50 Insurance recoveries recognized (109 ) (109 ) (58 ) (58 ) Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ (106 ) $ $ (106 ) $ (11 ) $ 3 $ (8 ) Net loss (gain) $ (105 ) $ $ (105 ) $ 1 $ 3 $ 4 The amounts in the table above exclude actual lost profits due to the interruption of the meat snacks business in the periods presented, but do reflect the recovery of the related business interruption insurance claim in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Restructuring Plans In February 2011, our Board of Directors approved a plan recommended by executive management designed to optimize our manufacturing and distribution networks (the Network Optimization Plan, which we previously referred to as the 2011 plan). The Network Optimization Plan consists of projects that involve, among other things, the exit of certain manufacturing facilities, the disposal of underutilized manufacturing assets, and actions designed to optimize our distribution network. Implementation of the plan is expected to continue through fiscal 2013 and is intended to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and reduce costs. In connection with the Network Optimization Plan, we currently estimate we will incur aggregate pre tax costs of approximately $55 million, including approximately $22 million of cash charges. In fiscal 2011, we recognized charges of $31 million in relation to the Network Optimization Plan. In March 2010, we announced a plan, authorized by our Board of Directors, related to the long term production of our meat snack products. The plan provides for the closure of our meat snacks production facility in Garner, North Carolina, and the movement of production to our existing facility in Troy, Ohio. Since the Garner accident, the Troy facility has been producing a portion of our meat snack products. Upon substantial completion of the plans implementation by the end of fiscal 2011, the Troy facility has become our primary meat snacks production facility. 17 Table of Contents In May 2010, we made a decision to consolidate certain administrative functions from Edina, Minnesota, to Naperville, Illinois. The transition of these functions was completed in the first half of fiscal 2011. This plan, together with the plan to move production of our meat snacks from Garner, North Carolina to Troy, Ohio, are collectively referred to as the 2010 restructuring plan (the 2010 plan). In connection with the 2010 plan, we expect to incur pre tax cash and non cash charges of $68 million. In fiscal 2011 and 2010, we recognized charges of approximately $26 million and $39 million, respectively, in relation to these plans. As part of a focus on cost reduction, we previously carried out a restructuring plan focused on streamlining our supply chain and reducing selling, general, and administrative costs (the 2006 2008 restructuring plan). As part of the 2006 2008 restructuring plan, we began construction of a new production facility in fiscal 2007. As a result of an updated assessment of manufacturing strategies and the related impact on this partially completed production facility, we decided to divest this facility. Accordingly, in fiscal 2010, we recognized a non cash impairment charge of $33 million, representing a write down of the carrying value of the assets to fair value based on anticipated proceeds from the sale. This charge is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consumer Foods segment. The Network Optimization Plan and the 2010 plan are collectively referred to as our restructuring plans. Management continues to evaluate our manufacturing footprint and potential opportunities to generate cost savings. If such opportunities are identified, the Network Optimization Plan will be amended accordingly, and this could lead to significant additional restructuring expenses. Acquisitions In June 2010, we acquired the assets of American Pie, LLC, a manufacturer of frozen fruit pies, thaw and serve pies, fruit cobblers, and pie crusts under the licensed Marie Callenders and Claim Jumper trade names, as well as frozen dinners, pot pies, and appetizers under the Claim Jumper trade name. We paid $131 million in cash plus assumed liabilities for this business. This business is included in the Consumer Foods segment. During fiscal 2010, we completed the acquisition of Elan Nutrition (Elan), a privately held formulator and manufacturer of private label snack and nutrition bars, for approximately $103 million in cash. This business is included in the Consumer Foods segment. In June 2011, we purchased various Marie Callenders brand trademarks from Marie Callender Pie Shops, Inc., for approximately $58 million. Divestitures In July 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Gilroy Foods Flavorstm dehydrated garlic, onion, capsicum and Controlled Moisturetm, GardenFrost, Redi Madetm, and fresh vegetable operations for $246 million in cash. Based on our estimate of proceeds from the sale of this business, we recognized impairment and related charges totaling $59 million ($40 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In May 2011, we completed the sale of the assets of our frozen handhelds operations for approximately $10 million. We recognized charges totaling $22 million ($14 million after tax) relating to the impairment of the long lived assets of the business. We reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Capital Allocation During fiscal 2011, we received $554 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 36 million shares of our common stock for $825 million, and we repaid the entire principal balance of $248 million of our 7.875% senior notes, which were due September 15, 2010. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased 4 million shares of our common stock for $100 million. 18 Table of Contents During fiscal 2011, we paid dividends of $375 million. SEGMENT REVIEW We report our operations in two reporting segments: Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods. Consumer Foods The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded and private label food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice channels, principally in North America. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf stable temperature classes. In May 2011, we completed the sale of the assets of our frozen handhelds operations for approximately $10 million. We recognized charges totaling $22 million ($14 million after tax) relating to the impairment of the long lived assets of the business. We reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In February 2010, we completed the sale of our Lucks brand for proceeds of approximately $22 million in cash, resulting in a pre tax gain of $14 million ($9 million after tax), reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. In June 2009, we completed the divestiture of the Fernandos foodservice business for proceeds of $6 million in cash. We reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the divested Fernandos business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods prior to divestiture. Commercial Foods The Commercial Foods reporting segment principally includes commercially branded foods and ingredients, which are sold primarily to foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segments primary products include: specialty potato products, milled grain ingredients, and a variety of vegetable products, seasonings, blends, and flavors, which are sold under brands such as ConAgra Mills, Lamb Weston, and Spicetec Flavors SeasoningsTM. As discussed above, we reflected the results of the Gilroy Foods Flavorstm operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the divested Gilroy Foods Flavorstm dehydrated vegetable business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented prior to divestiture. Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) for Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives (except those related to our milling operations, see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements) are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. 19 Table of Contents The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended May 29, May 30, 2011 2010 Net derivative gains (losses) incurred $ 35.1 $ (16.9 ) Less: Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to reporting segments 0.6 (19.3 ) Net derivative gains recognized in general corporate expenses $ 34.5 $ 2.4 Net derivative gains (losses) allocated to Consumer Foods $ 3.6 $ (14.3 ) Net derivative losses allocated to Commercial Foods (3.0 ) (5.0 ) Net derivative gains (losses) included in segment operating profit $ 0.6 $ (19.3 ) Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify gains of $34 million and losses of $2 million to segment operating results in fiscal 2012 and 2013 and thereafter, respectively. Amounts allocated, or to be allocated, to segment operating results during fiscal 2011 and thereafter include net losses of $3 million recognized within corporate expense prior to fiscal 2011. 2011 vs. 2010 Net Sales ($ in millions) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 % Increase/ Reporting Segment Net Sales Net Sales (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 8,002 $ 7,940 1 % Commercial Foods 4,301 4,075 6 % Total $ 12,303 $ 12,015 2 % Overall, our net sales increased $288 million to $12.3 billion in fiscal 2011, reflecting a 1% increase in our Consumer Foods segment and a 6% increase in our Commercial Foods segment relative to results in fiscal 2010. Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2011 were $8.0 billion, an increase of 1% as compared to fiscal 2010. Results reflected a 2% benefit from acquisitions, net of divestitures, a 1% decrease in volume from existing businesses, and essentially unchanged net pricing and mix. The decrease in volume from existing businesses reflected highly competitive pricing for some products, as well as lower consumption in certain product categories. The net pricing impacts for fiscal 2011 were not significant, reflecting the fact that price increases in the second half of the year were offset by pricing reductions earlier in the year related to competitive pressures. Sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands, including Blue Bonnet, Marie Callenders, Peter Pan, Reddi wip, Ro*Tel, Slim Jim, Snack Pack, and Wesson, grew in fiscal 2011. Significant brands that experienced sales declines in fiscal 2011 included ACT II, Banquet, Chef Boyardee, Egg Beaters, Healthy Choice, Hunts, Libbys, Orville Redenbachers, PAM, Swiss Miss, and Van Camps . Commercial Foods net sales were $4.3 billion in fiscal 2011, an increase of $226 million, or 6% compared to fiscal 2010. Net sales in our flour milling business were approximately $107 million higher in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010, principally reflecting the pass through of higher wheat prices. Results also reflected a $98 million increase in sales in our Lamb Weston specialty potato products business, reflecting higher volume of approximately 4% and flat net pricing and mix. The increase in sales volume included significant growth in sales of sweet potato products. 20 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SGA) SGA expenses totaled $1.51 billion for fiscal 2011, a decrease of $308 million, or 17%, compared to fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 reflected the following: a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $130 million, a net benefit of $105 million in connection with the settlement of insurance claims, net of expenses incurred, related to the Garner accident, charges totaling $35 million in connection with our restructuring plans, a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of $37 million, an increase in salaries and labor expense of $26 million, a gain of $25 million from the receipt, as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, in advance of the scheduled maturity dates, a decrease in charitable donations of $13 million, a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $11 million, an increase in self insured medical expense of $10 million, and a decrease in property, sales, and use taxes of $10 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 included the following: charges totaling $36 million in connection with the 2010 plan, consisting of charges related to our decision to move manufacturing activities in Garner, North Carolina to Troy, Ohio, and our decision to move administrative functions in Edina, Minnesota to Naperville, Illinois, a charge of $33 million in connection with the impairment of a partially completed production facility, a benefit of $15 million associated with a favorable adjustment to an environmental related liability, transaction related costs of $14 million associated with securing federal tax benefits related to the Delhi, LA sweet potato production facility (the associated income tax benefits will be recognized in future periods), a $14 million gain on the sale of the Lucks brand, and a net benefit of $8 million, representing SGA expenses associated with the Garner accident that were more than offset by insurance recoveries (related charges of $12 million were recognized in cost of goods sold). Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense (net), income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Operating Operating % Increase/ Reporting Segment Profit Profit (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 1,144 $ 1,110 3 % Commercial Foods 505 539 (6 )% Consumer Foods operating profit increased $34 million in fiscal 2011 versus the prior year to $1.14 billion. Gross profits were $156 million lower in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 driven by the impact of higher commodity 21 Table of Contents input costs that were not fully offset by the benefit of price increases and supply chain cost savings initiatives. Other items that significantly impacted Consumer Foods operating profit in fiscal 2011 included: a net benefit of $105 million in connection with the settlement of insurance claims, net of expenses incurred, related to the Garner accident, a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $48 million, a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of $42 million, charges totaling $45 million in connection with the Companys restructuring plans, and the impact of foreign currencies, including related economic hedges, resulted in an increase of operating profit of approximately $27 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Items that significantly impacted Consumer Foods operating profit in fiscal 2010 included: charges totaling $36 million in connection with our restructuring plans, a charge of $33 million in connection with the impairment of a partially completed production facility, and a $14 million gain on the sale of the Lucks brand. Commercial Foods operating profit decreased $34 million in fiscal 2011 versus the prior year to $505 million. Gross profits in our Lamb Weston specialty potato business were negatively impacted in fiscal 2011 by significant increases in input costs which more than offset the benefit of increased sales volumes and a higher quality potato crop than that which was processed in fiscal 2010 and the first half of fiscal 2011. Gross profits in our flour milling business improved in fiscal 2011 due to effective management of margins in a volatile wheat market, which more than offset the decrease in sales volumes. SGA expenses were lower in the Commercial Foods segment in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, largely due to a $13 million decrease in incentive compensation expense. The Commercial Foods segment also recognized charges of $11 million in fiscal 2011 in connection with our restructuring plans. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2011, net interest expense was $178 million, an increase of $17 million, or 11%, from fiscal 2010. Included in net interest expense was $42 million and $85 million of interest income in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, principally from the Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising business in June 2008. Interest expense in fiscal 2011 also reflected a net benefit of $13 million primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable (this hedge was terminated in fiscal 2011) and the benefit of the repayment of $248 million of debt in September 2010. During fiscal 2010, we received $115 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on a portion of the Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity date. In December 2010, we received $554 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. We expect net interest expense to be significantly higher in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011, reflecting lower interest income. Income Taxes Our income tax expense was $421 million and $361 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2011 and 33% in fiscal 2010. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was reflective of favorable changes in estimates and audit settlements, as well as certain income tax credits and deductions identified in fiscal 2010 that related to prior periods. These benefits were offset, in part, by unfavorable tax consequences of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2012, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately 34%. 22 Table of Contents Equity Method Investment Earnings We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our equity method investments was $26 million ($6 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $20 million in the Commercial Foods segment) and $22 million ($5 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $17 million in the Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Equity method investment earnings in the Commercial Foods segment reflected improving market conditions in a foreign potato processing venture and continued difficult market conditions for our domestic potato ventures. Results of Discontinued Operations Our discontinued operations generated after tax losses of $12 million and $19 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. In fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of the assets of a small frozen foods business for approximately $10 million. We recognized after tax impairment charges totaling $14 million in connection with this sale. In fiscal 2010, we decided to divest our dehydrated vegetable operations. As a result of this decision, we recognized an after tax impairment charge of $40 million in fiscal 2010, representing a write down of the carrying value of the related long lived assets to fair value, based on the anticipated sales proceeds. The sale of this business for $246 million in cash was completed in July 2010. Operating results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 include the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter relating to a divested business. Operating results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2010 include charges related to certain legal and environmental matters of divested businesses. Earnings Per Share Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 were $1.88 (including earnings of $1.90 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from discontinued operations). Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 were $1.62 (including earnings of $1.66 per diluted share from continuing operations and losses of $0.04 per diluted share from discontinued operations). See Items Impacting Comparability above as several significant items affected the comparability of year over year results of operations. 2010 vs. 2009 Net Sales ($ in millions) Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 % Increase/ Reporting Segment Net Sales Net Sales (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 7,940 $ 7,904 % Commercial Foods 4,075 4,445 (8 )% Total $ 12,015 $ 12,349 (3 )% Overall, our net sales decreased $334 million to $12.02 billion in fiscal 2010, primarily driven by fiscal 2009 including 53 weeks, as well as lower flour milling net sales in fiscal 2010 resulting from lower underlying wheat costs passed on to customers. This decrease was partially offset by improved pricing and mix in the Consumer Foods segment and the Lamb Weston specialty potato products business in the Commercial Foods segment. Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of results. Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2010 were $7.94 billion, basically flat as compared to fiscal 2009. Results reflected flat volume and essentially unchanged net pricing and mix. Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of results. Excluding the impact of the additional week, volume increased 2% in fiscal 2010, reflecting successful innovation and marketing. Sales of products associated with some of our other most significant brands, including Chef Boyardee, Healthy Choice, Hunts, Marie Callenders, Orville Redenbachers, Reddi wip, and Snack Pack grew in fiscal 2010. Sales of Blue Bonnet and Wesson declined by 19% and 7%, respectively, in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009, largely due to the impact of passing through lower vegetable oil costs. Other significant brands whose 23 Table of Contents products experienced sales declines in fiscal 2010 include ACT II, Banquet, Egg Beaters, Kid Cuisine, Libbys, PAM, and Slim Jim. Commercial Foods net sales were $4.08 billion in fiscal 2010, a decrease of $370 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal 2009. Net sales in our flour milling business were approximately $330 million lower in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009, principally reflecting the pass through of lower wheat prices. Results also reflected a slight decrease in sales in our Lamb Weston specialty potato products business, reflecting lower volume of approximately 2%, partially offset by increased pricing. Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of results. Excluding the impact of the additional week, volume was essentially unchanged in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. SGA Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SGA) SGA expenses totaled $1.82 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2009. We estimate that the inclusion of the extra week in the fiscal 2009 results increased SGA expenses by approximately 2% in that fiscal year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 reflected the following: an increase in incentive compensation expense of $99 million, charges totaling $36 million in connection with the 2010 plan, consisting of charges related to the Companys decision to move manufacturing activities in Garner, North Carolina to Troy, Ohio, and the Companys decision to move administrative functions in Edina, Minnesota to Naperville, Illinois, a charge of $33 million in connection with the impairment of a partially completed production facility, an increase in advertising and promotion expense of $29 million, an increase in self insured medical expense of $15 million, a benefit of $15 million associated with a favorable adjustment to an environmental related liability, transaction related costs of $14 million associated with securing federal tax benefits related to the Delhi, LA sweet potato production facility (the associated income tax benefits will be recognized in future periods), a $14 million gain on the sale of the Lucks brand, increase in stock based compensation expense of $13 million, a decrease in charitable donations of $9 million, and a net benefit of $8 million, representing SGA expenses associated with the Garner accident that were more than offset by insurance recoveries. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 reflected the following: a charge of $50 million representing the net premium and fees paid to retire certain debt instruments prior to maturity, a charge of $25 million related to a coverage dispute with an insurer, a gain of $19 million from the sale of the Pemmican brand, charges related to peanut butter and pot pie recalls of $11 million, charges of $10 million related to the execution of our restructuring plans, and $5 million of income, net of direct pass through costs, for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses. 24 Table of Contents Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense (net), income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Operating Operating % Increase/ Reporting Segment Profit Profit (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 1,110 $ 946 17 % Commercial Foods 539 542 (1 )% Consumer Foods operating profit increased $164 million in fiscal 2010 versus the prior year to $1.1 billion. Gross profits were $262 million higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009 driven by the impact of lower commodity input costs, and the benefit of supply chain cost savings initiatives. Consumer Foods SGA expenses were higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009, reflecting a $34 million increase in incentive compensation expenses and a $22 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses. The Consumer Foods segment recognized a $14 million gain on the sale of the Lucks brand in fiscal 2010. Charges totaling $36 million were recognized in the Consumer Foods segment in fiscal 2010 in connection with the 2010 plan, including charges related to our decision to move manufacturing activities in Garner, North Carolina to Troy, Ohio, and our decision to move administrative functions in Edina, Minnesota to Naperville, Illinois. An additional charge of $33 million was recognized in connection with the impairment of a production facility, as we made a decision to divest the partially completed facility. The Consumer Foods segment recognized a $19 million gain on the sale of the Pemmican brand, incurred costs of product recalls classified as SGA expense of $11 million, and incurred costs of $8 million in connection with our restructuring plans in fiscal 2009. The impact of foreign currencies, including related economic hedges, resulted in a reduction of operating profit of approximately $9 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. The Garner accident in June 2009 resulted in charges within SGA totaling $47 million for the impairment of property, plant and equipment, workers compensation, site clean up, and other related costs in fiscal 2010 (in addition to inventory write downs and other related costs of $12 million recognized in cost of goods sold). The impact of these charges was offset by insurance recoveries of $58 million in fiscal 2010 for the involuntary conversion of assets. Gross profits from Slim Jim branded products were $25 million and $51 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, reflecting the impact of the disruption of production due to the accident. Commercial Foods operating profit decreased $3 million in fiscal 2010 versus the prior year to $539 million. Improved gross profits in the flour milling business were partially offset by reduced gross profits in the specialty blends and flavorings business and the specialty potato business. Gross profits continued to be negatively impacted by challenging conditions in the foodservice channel as well as high production costs associated with a high cost and poor quality potato crop in our specialty potato business. Commercial Foods SGA expenses were higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009, reflecting a $5 million increase in incentive compensation expenses. Commercial Foods operating profit for fiscal 2009 reflected the benefit of the additional week of operations. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2010, net interest expense was $160 million, a decrease of $26 million, or 14%, from fiscal 2009. The reduction in net interest expense is primarily the result of increased capitalized interest and increased interest income in fiscal 2010. Interest income includes $83 million and $73 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, from the payment in kind notes received in June 2008 in connection with the divestiture of our trading and merchandising operations. Income Taxes Our income tax expense was $361 million and $317 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 33% for fiscal 2010 and 34% in fiscal 2009. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was reflective of favorable changes in estimates and audit settlements, as well as certain income tax 25 Table of Contents credits and deductions identified in fiscal 2010 that related to prior periods. These benefits were offset, in part, by unfavorable tax consequences of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Equity Method Investment Earnings We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our equity method investments was $22 million ($5 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $17 million in the Commercial Foods segment) and $24 million ($5 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $19 million in the Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Equity method investment earnings in the Commercial Foods segment reflected continued difficult market conditions for our foreign and domestic potato ventures. Results of Discontinued Operations Our discontinued operations generated an after tax loss of $19 million in fiscal 2010 and earnings of $364 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we decided to divest our dehydrated vegetable operations. As a result of this decision, we recognized an after tax impairment charge of $40 million in fiscal 2010, representing a write down of the carrying value of the related long lived assets to fair value, based on the anticipated sales proceeds. In fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the trading and merchandising operations and recognized an after tax gain on the disposition of approximately $301 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we decided to sell certain small foodservice brands. The sale of these brands was completed in June 2009. We recognized after tax impairment charges of $6 million in fiscal 2009, in anticipation of this divestiture. Earnings Per Share Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 were $1.62 (including earnings of $1.66 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $0.04 per diluted share from discontinued operations). Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 were $2.15 (including earnings of $1.35 per diluted share from continuing operations and $0.80 per diluted share from discontinued operations), respectively. See Items Impacting Comparability above as several other significant items affected the comparability of year over year results of operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital Our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. If necessary, we use short term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities) and a combination of equity and long term debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets. At May 29, 2011, we had a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions, which matures in December 2011. We expect to refinance the facility prior to maturity at terms that will enable us to maintain sufficient liquidity to support our business needs. The facility has historically been used principally as a back up facility for our commercial paper program. As of May 29, 2011, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. We did not draw upon this facility or the commercial paper program during fiscal 2011. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. The facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65% of our consolidated capital base, and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. As of May 29, 2011, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. As of the end of fiscal 2011, our senior long term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short term credit ratings would impact our ability to 26 Table of Contents borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult. In connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, we received $550 million (face value) of the Notes issued by the purchaser of the divested business. During fiscal 2010, we received $115 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on a portion of the Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity date. During fiscal 2011, we received $554 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. We repurchase our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board of Directors. In February 2010, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase program with no expiration date. We repurchased approximately 4 million shares of our common stock for approximately $100 million under this program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2010, our Board of Directors increased the Companys share repurchase authorization by $554 million, the amount of the early repayment of the remaining Notes. We repurchased approximately 36 million shares of our common stock for $825 million under this program in fiscal 2011. The Companys total remaining share repurchase authorization was $129 million as of the end of fiscal 2011. In July 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Gilroy Foods Flavorstm dehydrated garlic, onion, capsicum and Controlled Moisturetm, GardenFrost, Redi Madetm, and fresh vegetable operations for $246 million in cash. On September 15, 2010, we repaid the entire principal balance of $248 million of our 7.875% senior notes, due on that date. We expect to repay the entire principal balance of $343 million of our 6.75% senior notes, due September 15, 2011, with cash on hand. Cash Flows In fiscal 2011, we generated $19 million of cash, which was the net result of $1.35 billion generated from operating activities, $89 million generated from investing activities, $1.43 billion used in financing activities, and an increase of $10 million in cash and cash equivalents due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $1.34 billion for fiscal 2011 as compared to $1.43 billion generated in fiscal 2010. Results reflect increased income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011. Improvement in our accounts payable balance largely offset increases in the inventory balance, reflecting the impact of higher commodity costs in our flour milling business. The year over year decrease in operating cash flows also reflects higher incentive payments made in fiscal 2011 (earned in fiscal 2010), than those made in fiscal 2010 (related to fiscal 2009 performance). We also contributed $129 million and $123 million to our Company sponsored pension plans in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cash payments of income taxes were $172 million and $291 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, reflecting the benefit of changes in certain federal income tax laws that will allow us to defer the payment of a significant amount of income taxes recognized in fiscal 2011 until future years. Fiscal 2011 operating cash flows also reflect the receipt of $142 million of interest due on the remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, and insurance advances of $65 million for reimbursement of out of pocket expenses and foregone profits associated with the Garner accident. Cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was $12 million and $43 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily reflecting income from operations of the discontinued Gilroy Foods Flavorstm dehydrated vegetable business and reduced inventory balances within that business. Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled $166 million in fiscal 2011 and $352 million in fiscal 2010. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2011 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $466 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangibles (including American Pie) totaling $149 million, partially offset by the receipt of $413 million, as payment in full of all amounts due on the remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009 (receipt of interest due 27 Table of Contents is reflected in operating cash flows), and sales of property, plant and equipment of $19 million. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2010 included capital expenditures of $482 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangibles (including Elan) totaling $107 million, partially offset by sales of businesses and brands (including the Lucks brand) of $22 million and sales of property, plant, and equipment of $88 million. Also included in investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2010 was a cash inflow of $92 million (of the total receipt of $115 million) representing the payment in full of all principal and interest due on the first tranche of the Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity date (the remaining $23 million is reflected as cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations), and insurance advances of $35 million for the replacement of property, plant and equipment destroyed in the Garner accident. We generated $255 million of cash from investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 from the disposition of the Gilroy Foods Flavorstm dehydrated vegetable business. Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.43 billion in fiscal 2011, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $405 million in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 36 million shares of our common stock for $825 million, we paid dividends of $375 million, and we decreased our debt by $294 million, including the repayment of the entire principal balance of $248 million of our 7.875% senior notes on September 15, 2010, due on that date, as well as the repayment of $35 million of bank borrowings by our Lamb Weston BSW potato processing venture. During fiscal 2011, we also received net proceeds of $60 million from employees exercising stock options, net of tax payments we made related to issuance of stock awards. During fiscal 2010, we paid dividends of $347 million, we repurchased $100 million of our common stock as part of our share repurchase program, and we reduced our long term debt by $16 million. During fiscal 2010, we also received net proceeds of $55 million from employees exercising stock options, net of tax payments related to issuance of stock awards. We estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 will be approximately $475 million. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We use off balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in Obligations and Commitments, below. Variable Interest Entities Not Consolidated We have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities. We hold a 50% interest in Lamb Weston RDO, a potato processing venture. We provide all sales and marketing services to Lamb Weston RDO. We receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture. We reflect the value of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, based upon the equity method of accounting. The balance of our investment was $14 million at both May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, representing our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this venture. The capital structure of Lamb Weston RDO includes owners equity of $27 million and term borrowings from banks of $50 million as of May 29, 2011. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this venture. We lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements with these entities include fixed price purchase options for the assets being leased, representing our only variable interest in these lessor entities. These leases are accounted for as operating leases, and accordingly, there are no material assets or liabilities associated with these entities included in our balance sheets. We have no material exposure to loss from our variable interests in these entities. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. In making 28 Table of Contents this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreements, the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entities. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as take or pay contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt and capital lease obligations, which totaled $3.3 billion as of May 29, 2011, were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled approximately $946 million as of May 29, 2011, were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2011 was as follows (including obligations of discontinued operations): Payments Due by Period ($ in millions) Less than After 5 Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Years Long term debt $ 3,236.3 $ 356.7 $ 532.8 $ 76.9 $ 2,269.9 Capital lease obligations 61.8 5.5 9.1 5.2 42.0 Operating lease obligations 367.0 65.5 102.9 66.6 132.0 Purchase obligations 578.5 489.8 40.3 21.8 26.6 Total $ 4,243.6 $ 917.5 $ 685.1 $ 170.5 $ 2,470.5 The purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect open purchase orders of approximately $475 million, some of which are not legally binding. These purchase orders are expected to be settled in the ordinary course of business in less than one year. We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted average interest rate of the long term debt obligations outstanding as of May 29, 2011 was approximately 6.4%. As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. A summary of our commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2011, is as follows: Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period ($ in millions) Less than After 5 Other Commercial Commitments Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Years Guarantees $ 94.1 $ 39.7 $ 10.9 $ 12.0 $ 31.5 Other Commitments 0.4 0.4 Total $ 94.5 $ 40.1 $ 10.9 $ 12.0 $ 31.5 In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations resulting from the 2002 divestiture of our fresh beef and pork operations. The remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed five years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was approximately $13 million, included in the table above, as of May 29, 2011. We have also guaranteed the performance of the divested business with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 29 Table of Contents 1.2 million hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs. We are a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have guaranteed repayment of short term bank loans of the potato suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 29, 2011, the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was approximately $34 million, included in the table above. We have not established a liability for these guarantees, as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote. We are a party to various agreements with an onion processing company. We have guaranteed, under certain conditions, repayment of a portion of the loan held by this supplier for its onion processing related operations. At May 29, 2011, the amount of our guarantee was $25 million, included in the table above. In the event of default on this loan by the supplier, we have the contractual right to purchase the loan from the lender, thereby giving us secured rights to the underlying collateral. We have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee, as we believe the likelihood of financial exposure to us under this guarantee is remote. Federal income tax credits were generated related to the construction of our sweet potato production facility in Delhi, Louisiana. Third parties invested in certain of these income tax credits. We have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives, a period of seven years, in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced. The face value of the income tax credits was $21 million as of May 29, 2011. We believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote, and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee. The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for income taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 29, 2011 was approximately $56 million. The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 29, 2011, that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate was approximately $36 million. Recognition of this tax benefit would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management. Our Audit Committee has reviewed managements development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates. Marketing Costs We incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs, which include advertising, customer incentives, and consumer incentives. We recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For volume based incentives provided to customers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these factors change, managements estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time. We have recognized reserves of approximately $128 million for these marketing costs as of May 29, 2011. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows. 30 Table of Contents Advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled $372 million, $409 million, and $381 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Income Taxes Our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. Management uses historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third party specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities. Management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean up, our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible parties, and our experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of clean up. Managements estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change. We have recognized a reserve of approximately $70 million for environmental liabilities as of May 29, 2011. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy. Historically, the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary. In fiscal 2010, based on changes in the regulatory environment applicable to a particular site, we reduced the recognized environmental liability by approximately $15 million. Employment Related Benefits We incur certain employment related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers compensation. In order to measure the annual expense associated with these employment related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. We had recognized a pension liability of $352 million and $470 million, a postretirement liability of $322 million and $321 million, and a workers compensation liability of $74 million and $73 million, as of the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. We also had recognized a pension asset of $15 million as of the end of fiscal 2011, as certain individual plans of the Company had a positive funded status. 31 Table of Contents We recognized pension expense from Company plans of $55 million, $47 million, and $38 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, which reflected expected returns on plan assets of $173 million, $161 million, and $159 million, respectively. We contributed $129 million, $123 million, and $112 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $80 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2012. One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. We select a discount rate each year (as of our fiscal year end measurement date) for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year by year projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. The hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moodys Aa) available at the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 5.8% for fiscal year 2011, 6.9% for fiscal 2010, and 6.6% for fiscal 2009. We selected a discount rate of 5.3% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2012. A 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by $8 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by $9 million for the year. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense by approximately $9 million for fiscal 2012. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately $10 million for fiscal 2012. For our year end pension obligation determination, we selected a discount rate of 5.3% and 5.8% for fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plans investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, we selected 7.75% for the long term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2011 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $5 million. We selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2012. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $6 million. When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension plans, we use a market related value of assets that spreads asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and expected return) over five years. The market related value of assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2011 was $63 million higher than the actual fair value of plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. We determine this assumption based on our long term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. Based on this information, we selected 4.25% for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 as the rate of compensation increase for determining our year end pension obligation. We selected 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009. A 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. We selected a rate of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2012. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would increase/decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. We recognized postretirement benefit expense of $12 million, $9 million, and $15 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We reflected liabilities of $322 million and $321 million in our balance sheets as of May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $32 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2012. 32 Table of Contents The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 5.4% for fiscal 2011, 6.6% for fiscal 2010, and 6.4% for fiscal 2009. We have selected a discount rate of 4.9% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2012. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans. We have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 7.5%, with the trend rate decreasing to 5.0% by 2016. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effect: One Percent One Percent ($ in millions) Increase Decrease Effect on total service and interest cost $ 1 $ (1 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 24 (22 ) We provide workers compensation benefits to our employees. The measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation. The discount rate used at May 29, 2011 was 3.4%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense. Impairment of Long Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment), Goodwill, and Identifiable Intangible Assets We reduce the carrying amounts of long lived assets, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long lived assets, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets. We utilize a relief from royalty methodology in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. When determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. Estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and consumer trends. In determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital. As the calculated fair value of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge. OTHER MATTERS From time to time, one of our business units has engaged an environmental and agricultural engineering services firm. The firm is a subsidiary of an entity whose chief executive officer serves on our Board of Directors. Payments to this firm for environmental and agricultural engineering services and structures acquired totaled $0.3 million in both fiscal 2011 and 2010. 33 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This report, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2011 and 2010 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. These fluctuations impacted all reporting segments, as well as our trading and merchandising activities, which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our financial statements. Commodity Market Risk We purchase commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging materials to be used in our operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of associated counter party credit risk for all non exchange traded transactions. In addition, during our ownership of the trading and merchandising business (divested during quarter one of fiscal 2009), we purchased and sold certain commodities, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats, natural gas, and crude oil (presented in discontinued operations). Interest Rate Risk From time to time, we use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we entered into interest rate swap contracts used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable. During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we terminated these interest rate swap contracts. As a result of this termination, we received proceeds of $32 million. The cumulative adjustment to the fair value of the debt instruments being hedged, $35 million, was included in long term debt and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt instruments (through fiscal 2014). During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest rate risk related to our forecasted issuance of long term debt in 2014 (based on the anticipated refinancing of the senior long term debt maturing at that time). The net notional amount of these interest rate derivatives at May 29, 2011 was $250 million. The maximum potential loss associated with these interest rate swap contracts from a hypothetical change of 1% in interest rates is approximately $53 million. Any such gain or loss would be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings over the life of the forecasted interest payments associated with the anticipated debt refinancing. At May 29, 2011, we had recognized an unrealized loss of $12 million in accumulated other comprehensive income for these derivative instruments. 34 Table of Contents As of May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $208 million and $234 million, respectively, while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $232 million and $256 million, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations. This activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. Value at Risk (VaR) We employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk, including value at risk (VaR) models. We perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions. We use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of VaR that is used to monitor our daily risk. The purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices. Our model uses a 95 percent confidence level. Accordingly, in any given one day time period, losses greater than the amounts included in the table, below, are expected to occur only 5 percent of the time. We include commodity swaps, futures, and options and foreign exchange forwards, swaps, and options in this calculation. The following table provides an overview of our average daily VaR for our energy, agriculture, and other commodities as well as the average daily foreign exchange VaR. Other commodities may include items such as packaging, livestock, and or metals. Fair Value Impact (in millions) Average Average During Fifty two Weeks During Fifty two Weeks Ended May 29, 2011 Ended May 30, 2010 Energy Commodities $ 1.8 $ 1.3 Agriculture Commodities $ 3.2 $ 1.5 Other Commodities $ $ 0.1 Foreign Exchange $ 1.3 $ 0.9 Prior to fiscal 2011, we presented analyses of market risk using a sensitivity analysis methodology. During fiscal 2011, we began using a VaR methodology for purposes of this presentation, as this is a methodology used by management in monitoring market risk, and we believe this is a more useful presentation to readers. 35 Table of Contents
