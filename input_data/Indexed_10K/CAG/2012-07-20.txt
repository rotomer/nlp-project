ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to our financial performance and condition. The discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Results for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained in the future. Executive Overview ConAgra Foods, Inc. (NYSE: CAG) is one of North Americas leading food companies, with brands in 97% of Americas households. Consumers find Banquet&reg;, Chef Boyardee&reg;, Egg Beaters&reg;, Healthy Choice&reg;, Hebrew National&reg;, Hunts&reg;, Marie Callenders&reg;, Odoms Tennessee Pride&reg;, Orville Redenbachers&reg;, PAM&reg;, Peter Pan&reg;, Reddi wip&reg;, and many other ConAgra Foods brands in grocery, convenience, mass merchandise, and club stores. We also have a strong business to business presence, supplying frozen potato and sweet potato products, as well as other vegetable, spice, and grain products to a variety of well known restaurants, foodservice operators, and commercial customers. Fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share were $1.12. Fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share were $1.88, including income from continuing operations of $1.90 per diluted share and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from discontinued operations. Several significant items affect the comparability of year over year results of continuing operations (see Items Impacting Comparability below). Items Impacting Comparability Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2012 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations a charge of $397 million ($251 million after tax) reflecting the immediate write off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability, in accordance with our newly adopted change in accounting method, charges totaling $61 million ($37 million after tax) under our restructuring plans, a gain of $59 million ($59 million after tax), resulting from the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held noncontrolling equity interest in Agro Tech Foods Limited (ATFL), in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in that company, a charge of approximately $18 million ($18 million after tax) in connection with legal matters associated with the 2007 peanut butter recall, a benefit of $12 million ($7 million after tax) resulting from insurance settlements for matters associated with peanut butter, charges of $7 million ($4 million after tax) of acquisition related costs, including certain exit costs, and a charge of $5 million ($3 million after tax) in connection with the write off of an insurance claim receivable. Items of note impacting comparability for fiscal 2011 included the following: Reported within Continuing Operations a gain of $105 million ($66 million after tax) from the settlement of an insurance claim related to the Garner accident, charges totaling $56 million ($35 million after tax) under our restructuring plans, a gain of $25 million ($16 million after tax) from the receipt, as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining payment in kind notes received in connection with the divestiture of 17 Table of Contents the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009 (the Notes), in advance of the scheduled maturity dates, and a charge of $10 million ($6 million after tax) reflecting the immediate write off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability, in accordance with our newly adopted change in accounting method in fiscal 2012. Reported within Discontinued Operations Losses totaling $22 million ($14 million after tax) due to the write down of the carrying value of the assets of a small business. Restructuring Plans We anticipate incurring costs in connection with actions we take to attain synergies when integrating recently acquired businesses. These costs, collectively referred to as acquisition related exit costs, include severance and other costs associated with consolidating facilities and administrative functions. We expect to incur approximately $18 million of charges associated with fiscal year 2012 acquisitions ($10 million of which are cash charges). In fiscal 2012, we recognized charges of approximately $5 million in relation to acquisition related exit costs. In August 2011, we made a decision to reorganize our Consumer Foods sales function and certain other administrative functions within our Commercial Foods and Corporate reporting segments. These actions, collectively referred to as the Administrative Efficiency Plan, are intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the affected sales and administrative functions. In connection with the Administrative Efficiency Plan, we expect to incur approximately $19 million of charges ($17 million of which are cash charges), primarily for severance and costs of employee relocation. In fiscal 2012, we recognized charges of approximately $17 million in relation to the Administrative Efficiency Plan. In February 2011, our Board of Directors approved a plan recommended by executive management designed to optimize our manufacturing and distribution networks (the Network Optimization Plan, which we previously referred to as the 2011 plan). The Network Optimization Plan consists of projects that involve, among other things, the exit of certain manufacturing facilities, the disposal of underutilized manufacturing assets, and actions designed to optimize our distribution network. Implementation of the plan is expected to continue through fiscal 2013 and is intended to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and reduce costs. In connection with the Network Optimization Plan, we currently estimate we will incur aggregate pre tax costs of approximately $83 million, including approximately $26 million of cash charges. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, we recognized charges of $42 million and $31 million, respectively in relation to the Network Optimization Plan. In March 2010, we announced a plan, authorized by our Board of Directors, related to the long term production of our meat snack products. The plan provides for the closure of our meat snacks production facility in Garner, North Carolina, and the movement of production to our existing facility in Troy, Ohio. In May 2010, we made a decision to consolidate certain administrative functions from Edina, Minnesota to Naperville, Illinois. The transition of these functions was completed in fiscal 2011. This plan, together with the plan to move production of our meat snacks from Garner, North Carolina to Troy, Ohio, are collectively referred to as the 2010 restructuring plan (the 2010 plan). We have incurred pre tax charges of $68 million, including approximately $28 million in cash charges. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, we recognized charges of approximately $3 million and $26 million, respectively, in relation to these plans. We do not expect to incur significant additional charges in connection with the 2010 plan. In the aggregate, we expect to incur approximately $188 million of charges ($81 million of which are cash charges) under all of our restructuring plans. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, we recognized charges of $67 million and $57 million, respectively, in related restructuring activities. Management continues to evaluate our manufacturing footprint and potential opportunities to generate cost savings. If such opportunities are identified, the Network Optimization Plan will be amended accordingly, and this could lead to significant additional restructuring expenses. 18 Table of Contents Acquisitions In May 2012, we acquired Kangaroo Brands pita chip operations for $48 million in cash, plus assumed liabilities. The business, which manufactures private label and Kangaroo&reg; brand pita chip snacks, is included in the Consumer Foods segment.

Divestitures In May 2011, we completed the sale of the assets of our frozen handhelds operations for approximately $9 million. We recognized charges totaling $22 million ($14 million after tax) relating to the impairment of the long lived assets of the business. We reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In July 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Gilroy Foods & FlavorsTM dehydrated garlic, onion, capsicum and Controlled MoistureTM, GardenFrost&reg;, Redi MadeTM, and fresh vegetable operations for $246 million in cash. Based on our estimate of proceeds from the sale of this business, we recognized impairment and related charges totaling $59 million ($40 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We reflected the results of these operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Capital Allocation During fiscal year 2012, we repurchased approximately 14 million shares of our common stock for $352 million, of which approximately $213 million was funded by employee stock option exercise proceeds.

During fiscal 2011, we received $554 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, we paid dividends of $389 million and $375 million, respectively. 19 Table of Contents SEGMENT REVIEW We report our operations in two reporting segments: Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we changed the manner in which the expenses associated with certain administrative functions are recognized in segment sales. Accordingly, segment results of prior periods have been reclassified to reflect these changes. Consumer Foods The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded and private label food products that are sold in various retail and foodservice channels, principally in North America. The products include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf stable temperature classes. Commercial Foods The Commercial Foods reporting segment principally includes commercially branded foods and ingredients, which are sold primarily to foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segments primary products include: specialty potato products, milled grain ingredients, and a variety of vegetable products, seasonings, blends, and flavors, which are sold under brands such as ConAgra Mills&reg;, Lamb Weston&reg;, and Spicetec Flavors & SeasoningsTM. Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) for Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives (except those related to our milling operations, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements) are recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating results of the reporting segments in the period in which the underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings. The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses) from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under this methodology (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended May 27, 2012 May 29, 2011 Net derivative gains (losses) incurred $ (67) $ 35 Less: Net derivative gains allocated to reporting segments 24 1 Net derivative gains (losses) recognized in general corporate expenses $ (91 ) $ 34 Net derivative gains allocated to Consumer Foods $ 25 $ 4 Net derivative losses allocated to Commercial Foods (1 ) (3 ) Net derivative gains included in segment operating profit $ 24 $ 1 Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify losses of $47 million and $12 million to segment operating results in fiscal 2013 and 2014 and thereafter, respectively. Amounts allocated, or to be allocated, to segment operating results during fiscal 2012 and thereafter include $32 million of net gains recognized within corporate expense prior to fiscal 2012. 20 Table of Contents 2012 vs. 2011 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2012Net Sales Fiscal 2011Net Sales % Increase/(Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 8,377 $ 8,002 5% Commercial Foods 4,886 4,301 14% Total $ 13,263 $ 12,303 8% Overall, our net sales increased $960 million to $13.3 billion in fiscal 2012, reflecting a 5% increase in our Consumer Foods segment and a 14% increase in our Commercial Foods segment relative to results in fiscal 2011. Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2012 were $8.4 billion, an increase of 5% as compared to fiscal 2011. Results reflected a 3% benefit from acquisitions, a 5% benefit from favorable pricing and mix, and a 3% decrease in volume from our base businesses (those businesses existing at the beginning of fiscal 2012). The decrease in volume from existing businesses reflected difficult economic conditions that are impacting consumer purchasing behavior, as well as price increases taken earlier in fiscal 2012 for some products. Increased pricing was necessitated by increased commodity input costs. Sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands, including ACT II&reg;, Blue Bonnet&reg;, Chef Boyardee&reg;, Healthy Choice&reg;, Manwich&reg;, Marie Callenders&reg;, Peter Pan&reg;, Slim Jim&reg;, Van Camps &reg;, and Wesson&reg;, grew in fiscal 2012. Significant brands that experienced sales declines in fiscal 2012 included Banquet&reg;, Crunch n Munch&reg;, Egg Beaters&reg;, Hebrew National&reg;, Hunts&reg;, Kid Cuisine&reg;, Orville Redenbachers&reg;, PAM&reg;, Reddi wip&reg;, Snack Pack&reg;, and Swiss Miss&reg;. Commercial Foods net sales were $4.9 billion in fiscal 2012, an increase of $585 million, or 14% compared to fiscal 2011. Net sales in our flour milling business were approximately $284 million higher in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011, principally reflecting the pass through of higher wheat prices. Net sales also reflected a $256 million increase in results in our Lamb Weston&reg; specialty potato products business, reflecting improved net pricing of approximately 9% and higher volume of approximately 4%. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $2.0 billion for fiscal 2012, an increase of $488 million, or 32%, compared to fiscal 2011. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2012 reflected the following: an increase in pension and retirement expense of $336 million, reflecting the immediate write off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability, in accordance with our newly adopted change in accounting method, a gain of $59 million, resulting from the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held noncontrolling equity interest in ATFL, in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in that company, an increase in incentive compensation expense of $45 million, charges totaling $43 million in connection with our restructuring plans, a decrease in self insured medical expense of $21 million, a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of $7 million, a charge of approximately $18 million in connection with legal matters associated with the 2007 peanut butter recall, a benefit of $12 million resulting from insurance settlements for matters associated with peanut butter, and a charge of $5 million in connection with the write off of an insurance claim receivable. 21 Table of Contents SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 included the following: a net benefit of $105 million in connection with the settlement of insurance claims, net of expenses incurred, related to the Garner accident, charges totaling $35 million in connection with our restructuring plans, a gain of $25 million from the receipt, as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, in advance of the scheduled maturity dates, and a charge of $10 million reflecting the immediate write off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability, in accordance with our newly adopted change in accounting method in fiscal 2012. Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense (net), income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2012 OperatingProfit Fiscal 2011 OperatingProfit % Increase/ (Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 1,053 $ 1,126 (6) % Commercial Foods 547 510 7 % Consumer Foods operating profit decreased $73 million in fiscal 2012 versus the prior year to $1.05 billion. Gross profits in the Consumer Foods segment were $11 million higher in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011 driven by the benefit of price increases and supply chain cost savings initiatives, offset by the impact of higher commodity input costs (particularly for proteins, vegetable oil, and packaging). Businesses acquired in fiscal 2012 contributed $13 million of operating profit to fiscal 2012. Other items that significantly impacted Consumer Foods operating profit in fiscal 2012 included: a gain of $59 million, resulting from the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held noncontrolling equity interest in ATFL, in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in that company, charges totaling $56 million in connection with our restructuring plans, an increase in incentive compensation expense of $11 million, and a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of $9 million. Items that significantly impacted Consumer Foods operating profit in fiscal 2011 included: a net benefit of $105 million in connection with the settlement of insurance claims, net of expenses incurred, related to the Garner accident, and charges totaling $45 million in connection with our restructuring plans. Commercial Foods operating profit increased $37 million in fiscal 2012 versus the prior year to $547 million. Gross profits in the Commercial Foods segment were $56 million higher in fiscal 2012 than fiscal 2011, driven by higher sales volume and improved pricing in the Lamb Weston&reg; specialty potato business, largely offset by lower profits in our flour milling business. The decline in margins in the flour milling business was due to less favorable market conditions in the current year. SG&A expenses were higher in the Commercial Foods segment in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, largely due to a $14 million increase in incentive compensation expense. The Commercial Foods segment also recognized charges of $6 million in fiscal 2012 related to the execution of our restructuring plans. Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2012, net interest expense was $204 million, an increase of $27 million, or 15%, from fiscal 2011. Included in net interest expense was $4 million and $42 million of interest income in fiscal 2012 and 2011, 22 Table of Contents respectively. In 2011, the income was principally from interest on the Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising business in fiscal 2009. Interest expense in fiscal 2012 and 2011 also reflected a net benefit of $9 million and $13 million, respectively, primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable (these hedges were terminated in fiscal 2011) and the benefit of the repayment of $343 million of our 6.75% senior notes in September 2011. Income Taxes Our income tax expense was $196 million and $422 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 29% for fiscal 2012 and 34% in fiscal 2011. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 was reflective of the benefit of normal, recurring, income tax credits and deductions combined with a lower pre tax level of earnings (due in large part to the impact of the write off of $397 million of actuarial losses under the newly adopted method of pension accounting), as well as the non taxable nature of the $59 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our previously held noncontrolling equity interest in ATFL, in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in that company. We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2013, exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately 34%. Equity Method Investment Earnings We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our equity method investments was $45 million ($5 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $40 million in the Commercial Foods segment) and $26 million ($6 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $20 million in the Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Equity method investment earnings in the Commercial Foods segment were a result of more profitable operations of a foreign potato processing venture. Results of Discontinued Operations Our discontinued operations were immaterial in fiscal 2012 and generated after tax losses of $12 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of the assets of a small frozen foods business for approximately $9 million. We recognized after tax impairment charges totaling $14 million in connection with this sale. Operating results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 included the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter relating to a divested business. Earnings Per Share Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 were $1.12. Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 were $1.88 (including earnings of $1.90 per diluted share from continuing operations and losses of $0.02 per diluted share from discontinued operations). See Items Impacting Comparability above as several significant items affected the comparability of year over year results of operations. 2011 vs. 2010 Net Sales ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2011Net Sales Fiscal 2010Net Sales % Increase/(Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 8,002 $ 7,940 1% Commercial Foods 4,301 4,075 6% Total $ 12,303 $ 12,015 2% 23 Table of Contents Overall, our net sales increased $288 million to $12.3 billion in fiscal 2011, reflecting a 1% increase in our Consumer Foods segment and a 6% increase in our Commercial Foods segment relative to results in fiscal 2010. Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2011 were $8.0 billion, an increase of 1% as compared to fiscal 2010. Results reflected a 2% benefit from acquisitions, net of divestitures, a 1% decrease in volume from existing businesses, and essentially unchanged net pricing and mix. The decrease in volume from existing businesses reflected highly competitive pricing for some products, as well as lower consumption in certain product categories. The net pricing impacts for fiscal 2011 were not significant, reflecting the fact that price increases in the second half of the year were offset by pricing reductions earlier in the year related to competitive pressures. Sales of products associated with some of our most significant brands, including Blue Bonnet&reg;, Marie Callenders&reg;, Peter Pan&reg;, Reddi wip&reg;, Ro*Tel&reg;, Slim Jim&reg;, Snack Pack&reg;, and Wesson&reg;, grew in fiscal 2011. Significant brands that experienced sales declines in fiscal 2011 included ACT II&reg;, Banquet&reg;, Chef Boyardee&reg;, Egg Beaters&reg;, Healthy Choice&reg;, Hunts&reg;, Libbys&reg;, Orville Redenbachers&reg;, PAM&reg;, Swiss Miss&reg;, and Van Camps &reg;. Commercial Foods net sales were $4.3 billion in fiscal 2011, an increase of $226 million, or 6% compared to fiscal 2010. Net sales in our flour milling business were approximately $107 million higher in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010, principally reflecting the pass through of higher wheat prices. Results also reflected a $98 million increase in results in our Lamb Weston&reg; specialty potato products business, reflecting higher volume of approximately 4% and flat net pricing and mix. The increase in sales volume included significant growth in sales of sweet potato products. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense) (SG&A) SG&A expenses totaled $1.51 billion for fiscal 2011, a decrease of $478 million, or 24%, compared to fiscal 2010. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 reflected the following: a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $130 million, a net benefit of $105 million in connection with the settlement of insurance claims, net of expenses incurred, related to the Garner accident, charges totaling $35 million in connection with our restructuring plans, a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of $37 million, an increase in salaries and labor expense of $26 million, a gain of $25 million from the receipt, as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, in advance of the scheduled maturity dates, a decrease in charitable donations of $13 million, a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $11 million, a charge of $10 million reflecting the immediate write off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability, in accordance with our newly adopted change in accounting method in fiscal 2012, an increase in self insured medical expense of $10 million, and a decrease in property, sales, and use taxes of $10 million. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2010 included the following: a charge of $168 million reflecting the immediate write off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability, in accordance with our newly adopted change in accounting method in fiscal 2012, charges totaling $36 million in connection with the 2010 plan, consisting of charges related to our decision to move manufacturing activities in Garner, North Carolina to Troy, Ohio, and our decision to move administrative functions in Edina, Minnesota to Naperville, Illinois, 24 Table of Contents a charge of $33 million in connection with the impairment of a partially completed production facility, a benefit of $15 million associated with a favorable adjustment to an environmental related liability, transaction related costs of $14 million associated with securing federal tax benefits related to the Delhi, Louisiana sweet potato production facility (the associated income tax benefits will be recognized in future periods), a $14 million gain on the sale of the Lucks&reg; brand, and a net benefit of $8 million, representing SG&A expenses associated with the Garner accident that were more than offset by insurance recoveries (related charges of $12 million were recognized in cost of goods sold). Operating Profit (Earnings before general corporate expense, interest expense (net), income taxes, and equity method investment earnings) ($ in millions) Reporting Segment Fiscal 2011OperatingProfit Fiscal 2010OperatingProfit % Increase/(Decrease) Consumer Foods $ 1,126 $ 1,062 6% Commercial Foods 510 543 (6)% Consumer Foods operating profit increased $64 million in fiscal 2011 versus the prior year to $1.13 billion. Gross profits were $156 million lower in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 driven by the impact of higher commodity input costs that were not fully offset by the benefit of price increases and supply chain cost savings initiatives. Other items that significantly impacted Consumer Foods operating profit in fiscal 2011 included: a net benefit of $105 million in connection with the settlement of insurance claims, net of expenses incurred, related to the Garner accident, a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $48 million, a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of $42 million, charges totaling $45 million in connection with the Companys restructuring plans, and the impact of foreign currencies, including related economic hedges, resulted in an increase of operating profit of approximately $27 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010. Items that significantly impacted Consumer Foods operating profit in fiscal 2010 included: charges totaling $36 million in connection with our restructuring plans, a charge of $33 million in connection with the impairment of a partially completed production facility, and a $14 million gain on the sale of the Lucks&reg; brand. Commercial Foods operating profit decreased $33 million in fiscal 2011 versus the prior year to $510 million. Gross profits in our Lamb Weston&reg; specialty potato business were negatively impacted in fiscal 2011 by significant increases in input costs which more than offset the benefit of increased sales volumes and a higher quality potato crop than that which was processed in fiscal 2010 and the first half of fiscal 2011. Gross profits in our flour milling business improved in fiscal 2011 due to effective management of margins in a volatile wheat market, which more than offset the decrease in sales volumes. SG&A expenses were lower in the Commercial Foods segment in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, largely due to a $13 million decrease in incentive compensation expense. The Commercial Foods segment also recognized charges of $11 million in fiscal 2011 in connection with our restructuring plans. 25 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net In fiscal 2011, net interest expense was $178 million, an increase of $17 million, or 11%, from fiscal 2010. Included in net interest expense was $42 million and $85 million of interest income in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, principally from the Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising business in fiscal 2009. Interest expense in fiscal 2011 also reflected a net benefit of $13 million primarily resulting from interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable (these hedges were terminated in fiscal 2011) and the benefit of the repayment of $248 million of debt in September 2010. During fiscal 2010, we received $115 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on a portion of the Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity date. In December 2010, we received $554 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. Income Taxes Our income tax expense was $422 million and $292 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre tax income from continuing operations, inclusive of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2011 and 32% in fiscal 2010. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2010 was reflective of favorable changes in estimates and audit settlements, as well as certain income tax credits and deductions identified in fiscal 2010 that related to prior periods. These benefits were offset, in part, by unfavorable tax consequences of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Equity Method Investment Earnings We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates. Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our equity method investments was $26 million ($6 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $20 million in the Commercial Foods segment) and $22 million ($5 million in the Consumer Foods segment and $17 million in the Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Equity method investment earnings in the Commercial Foods segment reflected improving market conditions in a foreign potato processing venture and continued difficult market conditions for our domestic potato ventures. Results of Discontinued Operations Our discontinued operations generated after tax losses of $12 million and $19 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. In fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of the assets of a small frozen foods business for approximately $9 million. We recognized after tax impairment charges totaling $14 million in connection with this sale. In fiscal 2010, we decided to divest our dehydrated vegetable operations. As a result of this decision, we recognized an after tax impairment charge of $40 million in fiscal 2010, representing a write down of the carrying value of the related long lived assets to fair value, based on the anticipated sales proceeds. The sale of this business for $246 million in cash was completed in July 2010. Operating results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 include the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter relating to a divested business. Operating results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2010 include charges related to certain legal and environmental matters of divested businesses. Earnings Per Share Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 were $1.88 (including earnings of $1.90 per diluted share from continuing operations and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from discontinued operations). Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 were $1.37 (including earnings of $1.41 per diluted share from continuing operations and losses of $0.04 per diluted share from discontinued operations). See Items Impacting Comparability above as several significant items affected the comparability of year over year results of operations. 26 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity and Capital Our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital structure, including our goal of maintaining an investment grade credit rating, that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. If necessary, we use short term debt principally to finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities) and a combination of equity and long term debt to finance both our base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets. In September 2011, we entered into a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. The facility is scheduled to mature in September 2016. Borrowings under this facility will bear interest at 1.1% over LIBOR and may be prepaid without penalty. The facility, like its predecessor facility, has historically been used principally as a back up facility for our commercial paper program. As of May 27, 2012, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility. The facility requires that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65% of our consolidated capital base, and that our fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0 on a four quarter rolling basis. As of May 27, 2012, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. As of May 27, 2012, we had borrowings of $40 million outstanding under our commercial paper program, which was representative of the highest borrowings during the fiscal year. As of the end of fiscal 2012, our senior long term debt ratings were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs would increase. A downgrade of our short term credit ratings would impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more difficult. In connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, we received $550 million (face value) of the Notes issued by the purchaser of the divested business. During fiscal 2010, we received $115 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on a portion of the Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity date. During fiscal 2011, we received $554 million as payment in full of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. We repurchase our shares of common stock from time to time after considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase limits authorized by our Board of Directors. We repurchased approximately 13.8 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $352 million under this program in fiscal 2012, of which approximately $213 million was funded by employee stock option exercise proceeds. In December 2011, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $750 million increase to our share repurchase authorization. The Companys total remaining share repurchase authorization as of May 2012 was $527 million. Under the share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase our shares periodically over several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, and may do so in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In July 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Gilroy Foods & FlavorsTM dehydrated garlic, onion, capsicum and Controlled MoistureTM, GardenFrost&reg;, Redi MadeTM, and fresh vegetable operations for $246 million in cash. On September 15, 2011, we repaid the entire principal balance of $343 million of our 6.75% senior notes, due on that date. On September 15, 2010, we repaid the entire principal balance of $248 million of our 7.875% senior notes, due on that date. During fiscal 2012, we acquired National Pretzel Company, Del Monte Canada, Odoms Tennessee Pride, and Kangaroo Brands pita chip operations, as well as an additional equity interest in ATFL for a total of $635 million in cash, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2012, we also acquired the Marie Callenders&reg; brand trademarks for approximately $58 million in cash. 27 Table of Contents We also contributed $326 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2012, the majority of which was discretionary. Cash Flows In fiscal 2012, we utilized $869 million of cash, which was the net result of $1.05 billion generated from operating activities, $1.06 billion used in investing activities, $850 million used in financing activities, and a decrease of $7 million in cash and cash equivalents due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations totaled $1.05 billion for fiscal 2012, as compared to $1.34 billion generated in fiscal 2011. We contributed $326 million and $129 million to our Company sponsored pension plans in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash flows from operations benefited in fiscal 2012, relative to fiscal 2011, due to increasing accounts payable balances, despite slightly lower inventory balances (excluding impacts of acquisitions), and lower incentive compensation payments paid in fiscal 2012 (earned in fiscal 2011) than in fiscal 2011 (earned in fiscal 2010). In fiscal 2011, improvement in our accounts payable balance largely offset increases in the inventory balances, reflecting the impact of higher commodity costs in our flour milling business. Cash payments of income taxes were $191 million and $172 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Tax payments in fiscal 2011 reflected the benefit of changes in certain federal income tax laws that allowed us to defer the payment of a significant amount of income taxes recognized in fiscal 2011 until future years. Fiscal 2011 operating cash flows also reflect the receipt of $142 million of interest due on the remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, and insurance advances of $65 million for reimbursement of out of pocket expenses and foregone profits associated with the Garner accident. Cash generated from operating activities of discontinued operations was $2 million and $12 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily reflecting income from operations of the discontinued frozen handheld operations. Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations totaled $1.06 billion in fiscal 2012 and $166 million in fiscal 2011. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2012 consisted primarily of acquisitions of businesses and intangibles totaling $698 million, capital expenditures of $337 million, and a $40 million purchase of a secured loan. Investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2011 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $466 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangibles totaling $149 million, partially offset by the receipt of $413 million, as payment in full of all amounts due on the remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009 (receipt of interest due is reflected in operating cash flows), and sales of property, plant and equipment of $19 million. In fiscal 2011, we generated $255 million of cash from investing activities of discontinued operations from the disposition of the Gilroy Foods & FlavorsTM dehydrated vegetable business. Cash used in financing activities totaled $850 million in fiscal 2012, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $1.43 billion in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, we repurchased approximately 14 million shares of our common stock for $352 million, we paid dividends of $389 million, and we decreased our debt by $324 million, including the repayment of the entire principal balance of $343 million of our 6.75% senior notes on September 15, 2011, due on that date, partially offset by borrowings of $40 million in our commercial paper program. During fiscal 2012, we also received net proceeds of $213 million from employee stock option exercises. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 36 million shares of our common stock for $825 million, we paid dividends of $375 million, and we decreased our debt by $294 million, including the repayment of the entire principal balance of $248 million of our 7.875% senior notes on September 15, 2010, due on that date, as well as the repayment of $35 million of bank borrowings by our Lamb Weston BSW potato processing venture. During fiscal 2011, we also received net proceeds of $60 million from employee stock option exercises. We estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 will be approximately $450 million. Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months. 28 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We use off balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. These are described further in Obligations and Commitments, below. Variable Interest Entities Not Consolidated We have variable interests in certain entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate the financial statements of these entities. We hold a 50% interest in Lamb Weston RDO, a potato processing venture. We provide all sales and marketing services to Lamb Weston RDO. We receive a fee for these services based on a percentage of the net sales of the venture. We reflect the value of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets, based upon the equity method of accounting. The balance of our investment was $15 million and $14 million at May 27, 2012 and May 29, 2011, respectively, representing our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this venture. The capital structure of Lamb Weston RDO includes owners equity of $30 million and term borrowings from banks of $43 million as of May 27, 2012. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of this venture. We lease certain office buildings from entities that we have determined to be variable interest entities. The lease agreements with these entities include fixed price purchase options for the assets being leased, representing our only variable interest in these lessor entities. These leases are accounted for as operating leases, and accordingly, there are no material assets or liabilities associated with these entities included in our balance sheets. We have no material exposure to loss from our variable interests in these entities. We have determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities. In making this determination, we have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease agreements, the expected remaining useful lives of the assets leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entities. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements, and unconditional purchase obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as take or pay contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements are entered into in the normal course of business in order to ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of these items, debt and capital lease obligations, which totaled $3.0 billion as of May 27, 2012, were recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which totaled approximately $881 million as of May 27, 2012, were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal 2012 was as follows: ($ in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5Years Long term debt $ 2,879.6 $ 30.6 $ 578.4 $ 10.8 $ 2,259.8 Capital lease obligations 76.1 7.5 12.6 9.3 46.7 Operating lease obligations 444.4 82.8 135.1 91.1 135.4 Purchase obligations 436.6 361.5 46.2 6.0 22.9 Total $ 3,836.7 $ 482.4 $ 772.3 $ 117.2 $ 2,464.8 29 Table of Contents The purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect $638 million of open purchase orders or $437 million of agreements for goods and services, some of which are not legally binding. These purchase orders and agreements are generally settleable in the ordinary course of business in less than one year. The operating lease obligations noted in the table above have not been reduced by non cancellable sublease rentals of approximately $38 million. We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted average interest rate of the long term debt obligations outstanding as of May 27, 2012 was approximately 7.0%. We own a 49.99% interest in Lamb Weston BSW, LLC (Lamb Weston BSW), a potato processing venture with Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. (Ochoa). We provide all sales and marketing services to Lamb Weston BSW. Under certain circumstances, we could be required to compensate Ochoa for lost profits resulting from significant production shortfalls (production shortfalls). Commencing on June 1, 2018, or on an earlier date under certain circumstances, we have a contractual right to purchase the remaining equity interest in Lamb Weston BSW from Ochoa (the call option). We are currently subject to a contractual obligation to purchase all of Ochoas equity investment in Lamb Weston BSW at the option of Ochoa (the put option). The purchase prices under the call option and the put option (the options) are based on the book value of Ochoas equity interest at the date of exercise, as modified by an agreed upon rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance. The agreed upon rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which any of the options are exercised. As of May 27, 2012, the price at which Ochoa had the right to put its equity interest to us was $34.3 million. This amount, which is presented within other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, is not included in the Contractual Obligations table above, as the payment is contingent upon the exercise of the put option by Ochoa, and the eventual occurrence and timing of such exercise is uncertain. As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt or lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. A summary of our commitments, including commitments associated with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2012, is as follows: ($ in millions) Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period Other Commercial Commitments Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years After 5Years Guarantees $ 75.7 $ 49.0 $ 10.9 $ 9.3 $ 6.5 Other commitments 0.5 0.5 Total $ 76.2 $ 49.5 $ 10.9 $ 9.3 $ 6.5 In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations resulting from the 2002 divestiture of our fresh beef and pork operations. The remaining terms of these arrangements do not exceed four years and the maximum amount of future payments we have guaranteed was approximately $11 million, included in the table above, as of May 27, 2012. We have also guaranteed the performance of the divested business with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million hogs annually through June 1, 2013. The contract stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on certain inputs. We have not established a liability for these guarantees, as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote. We are a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have guaranteed repayment of short term bank loans of the potato suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 27, 2012, the amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was approximately 30 Table of Contents $44 million, included in the table above. We have not established a liability for these guarantees, as we have determined that the likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is remote. We were a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing company where we had guaranteed, under certain conditions, repayment of a secured loan (the Secured Loan) of this onion supplier to the onion suppliers lender. The Secured Loan was in the amount of approximately $40 million (classified as other assets in fiscal 2012) with a remaining term of approximately 11 years. The amount of our guarantee was $25 million. We had the option to purchase the Secured Loan, and thereby assume first priority secured rights to the underlying collateral for the amount of the Secured Loan. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we received notice from the lender that the onion supplier had defaulted on the Secured Loan and we purchased the Secured Loan from the lender for approximately $41 million, and cancelled our guarantee. The onion supplier subsequently filed for bankruptcy on April 12, 2012. Based on our estimate of the value of the collateral and our first priority secured rights, we expect to recover the carrying value of the Secured Loan. Federal income tax credits were generated related to the construction of our sweet potato production facility in Delhi, Louisiana. Third parties invested in certain of these income tax credits. We have guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income tax credits over their statutory lives, through fiscal 2017, in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or reduced. The face value of the income tax credits was $21 million, included in the table above, as of May 27, 2012. We believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax credits is remote, and therefore we have not established a liability in connection with this guarantee. The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any reserves for income taxes, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at May 27, 2012 was approximately $49 million. The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 27, 2012, that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate was approximately $30 million. Recognition of this tax benefit would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experiences combined with managements understanding of current facts and circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by management. Our Audit/Finance Committee has reviewed managements development, selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates. Marketing Costs We incur certain costs to promote our products through marketing programs, which include advertising, customer incentives, and consumer incentives. We recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The judgment required in determining when marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For volume based incentives provided to customers, management must continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our historical experience with marketing programs with consideration given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these factors change, managements estimates could change and we could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over different periods of time. We have recognized reserves of approximately $165 million for these marketing costs as of May 27, 2012. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual customer marketing program would not result in a material change in our results of operations or cash flows. Advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations totaled $365 million, $372 million, and $409 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 31 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our income tax expense is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment. Management uses historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 16 Pre tax Income and Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements. Environmental Liabilities Environmental liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated. Management works with independent third party specialists in order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities. Management estimates our environmental liabilities based on evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required clean up, our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible parties, and our experience in remediating sites. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or other external determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of clean up. Managements estimate as to our potential liability is independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and periodically updated as to the general status of known claims. We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the evaluation factors identified above, managements estimate of environmental liabilities may also change. We have recognized a reserve of approximately $71 million for environmental liabilities as of May 27, 2012. The reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the costs required to effect such remedy. Historically, the underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been necessary. Employment Related Benefits We incur certain employment related expenses associated with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and workers compensation. In order to measure the annual expense associated with these employment related benefits, management must make a variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimates used by management are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use third party specialists to assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with these employment related benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in us recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. We had recognized a pension liability of $566 million and $352 million, a postretirement liability of $283 million and $322 million, and a workers compensation liability of $76 million and $74 million, as of the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. We also had recognized a pension asset of $4 million and $15 million as of the end of fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, as certain individual plans of the Company had a positive funded status. In May 2012, we elected to change our method of accounting for pension benefits. Historically, we have recognized actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 32 Table of Contents upon each plan remeasurement, amortizing them into operating results over the average future service period of active employees in these plans, to the extent such gains and losses were in excess of 10% of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor). We have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur, to the extent they exceed the corridor; therefore, eliminating the amortization. Actuarial gains and losses outside the corridor, to the extent they occur, will be recognized annually as of our measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or when measurement is required otherwise under generally accepted accounting principles. Additionally, for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets, we will no longer use the market related value of plan assets, an averaging technique permitted under generally accepted accounting principles, but instead will use the fair value of plan assets. These changes are intended to improve the transparency of our operating results by more quickly recognizing the effects of changes in plan asset values and the impact of current interest rates on plan obligations. We recognized pension expense from Company plans of $422 million, $54 million, and $227 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Such amounts reflect an increase in pension expense, reflecting the immediate write off of actuarial losses in excess of 10% of our pension liability, in accordance with our newly adopted change in accounting method. This also reflected expected returns on plan assets of $196 million, $168 million, and $142 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. We contributed $326 million, $129 million, and $123 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $20 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2013. One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the discount rate. We select a discount rate each year (as of our fiscal year end measurement date) for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the year by year projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. The hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high quality fixed income debt instruments (usually Moodys Aa) available at the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was 5.3% for fiscal year 2012, 5.8% for fiscal 2011, and 6.9% for fiscal 2010. We selected a discount rate of 4.5% for determination of pension expense for fiscal 2013. A 25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2012 would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $97 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2012. A 25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the end of fiscal 2012 would have resulted in an increase of approximately $101 million in our pension expense for fiscal 2012. For our year end pension obligation determination, we selected discount rates of 4.5% and 5.3% for fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. Another significant assumption used to account for our pension plans is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. In developing the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for determining pension expense, we consider long term historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plans investments, the asset allocation among types of investments, estimated long term returns by investment type from external sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this information, we selected 7.75% for the long term rate of return on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2012 pension expense. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $6 million. We selected an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2013. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected long term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $7 million. The rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used in the development of accounting information for pension plans. We determine this assumption based on our long term plans for compensation increases and current economic conditions. Based on this information, we selected 4.25% for fiscal years 2012 and 2011 as the rate of compensation increase for determining our year end pension obligation. We selected 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of pension expense for each of fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010. A 25 basis point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would increase pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. We selected a rate of 33 Table of Contents 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to determine our pension expense for fiscal 2013. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our rate of compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2013 would increase/decrease pension expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million for the year. We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. We recognized postretirement benefit expense of $8 million, $12 million, and $9 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. We reflected liabilities of $283 million and $322 million in our balance sheets as of May 27, 2012 and May 29, 2011, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately $31 million to our postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2013. The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates, retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors. The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near term outlook, and an assessment of likely long term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience. The discount rate we selected for determination of postretirement expense was 4.3% for fiscal 2012, 5.4% for fiscal 2011, and 6.6% for fiscal 2010. We have selected a discount rate of 3.9% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal 2013. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would not have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for our plans. We have assumed the initial year increase in cost of health care to be 7.5%, with the trend rate decreasing to 5.0% by 2016. A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: ($ in millions) One PercentIncrease One PercentDecrease Effect on total service and interest cost $ 1 $ (1) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 14 (13) We provide workers compensation benefits to our employees. The measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligation. The discount rate used at May 27, 2012 was 3.0%. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have a material impact on workers compensation expense. Impairment of Long Lived Assets (including property, plant and equipment) and Identifiable Intangible Assets We reduce the carrying amounts of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets to their fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets. We utilize a relief from royalty methodology in evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks. The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate we would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular brand. When determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. Estimating future net sales requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and consumer trends. In determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest rate environment and our estimated cost of capital. As the calculated fair value of our other identifiable intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of our other identifiable intangible assets would not result in a material impairment charge. 34 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill is tested annually for impairment of value and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have negative effects on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods, among others. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, in conjunction with managements annual review of goodwill, we adopted new guidance for testing goodwill for impairment (see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements). Under the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent two step quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit (this would be fiscal 2011 in which the estimated fair values of all reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values) and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit. Under the two step quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset being tested for impairment as well as to select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such areas as future economic conditions, industry specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for goodwill. During the fiscal 2012 annual review of goodwill, management performed the qualitative assessment for all reporting units and concluded that it was more likely than not that their estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values. As such, no further analysis was required.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2012 and 2011 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. These fluctuations impacted all reporting segments. Commodity Market Risk We purchase commodity inputs such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging materials to be used in our operations. These commodities are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of associated counter party credit risk for all non exchange traded transactions. Interest Rate Risk From time to time, we use interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of debt. During fiscal 2010, we entered into interest rate swap contracts used to effectively convert the interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to variable. During fiscal 2011, we terminated these interest rate swap contracts. As a result of this termination, we received proceeds of $32 million. The cumulative adjustment to the fair value of the debt instruments being hedged, $35 million, was included in long term debt and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt instruments (through fiscal 2014). At May 27, 2012, the unamortized amount was $18 million. During fiscal 2011, we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest rate risk related to our forecasted issuance of long term debt in 2014 (based on the anticipated refinancing of the senior long term debt maturing at that time). The net notional amount of these interest rate derivatives at May 27, 2012 was $500 million. The maximum potential loss associated with these interest rate swap contracts from a hypothetical change of 1% in interest rates as of May 27, 2012 is approximately $151 million. Any such loss (or gain) would be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings over the life of the forecasted interest payments associated with the anticipated debt refinancing. At May 27, 2012, we had recognized an unrealized loss of $154 million in accumulated other comprehensive income for these derivative instruments. As of May 27, 2012 and May 29, 2011, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, based on current market rates primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of May 27, 2012 and May 29, 2011, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $211 million and $208 million, respectively, while a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $235 million and $232 million, respectively. Foreign Currency Risk In order to reduce exposures for our processing activities related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of our operations. This activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities. Value at Risk (VaR) We employ various tools to monitor our derivative risk, including value at risk (VaR) models. We perform simulations using historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value of current derivative positions. We use price and volatility information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of VaR that is used to monitor our daily risk. The purpose of this measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in time based on recent changes in market prices. Our model uses a 95% confidence level. Accordingly, in any given one day time period, losses greater than the amounts included in the table below are expected to occur only 5% of the time. We include commodity swaps, futures, and options and foreign exchange forwards, swaps, and options in this calculation. The following table provides an overview of our average daily VaR for our energy, agriculture, and other 36 Table of Contents commodities as well as the average daily foreign exchange VaR. Other commodities may include items such as packaging, livestock, and or metals.
