Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. It is our objective to provide the most meaningful disclosures in our Managements Discussion and Analysis in order to explain significant changes in our companys results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. As discussed in Note 22A in Item 15 of this Form 10 K/A, our segment financial information is not based on generally accepted accounting principles and it is not intended to measure contributions to enterprise results. Therefore, it is impractical for us to try to discuss our companys results of operations and liquidity and capital resources solely based on segment information. Where practical, we have linked our discussions to segment information provided in Table VI of Note 22 in Item 15 of this Form 10 K/A (see "Reconciliation of Machinery and Engine Sales by Geographic Region to External Sales by Marketing Segment" in this Item 7). Our discussions will focus on consolidated results and our three principal lines of business as described below: Consolidated represents the consolidated data of Caterpillar Inc. and all its subsidiaries (affiliated companies that are more than 50% owned). Machinery design, manufacture and marketing of construction, mining, agricultural and forestry machinery track and wheel tractors, track and wheel loaders, pipelayers, motor graders, wheel tractor scrapers, track and wheel excavators, backhoe loaders, mining shovels, log skidders, log loaders, off highway trucks, articulated trucks, paving products, telescopic handlers, skid steer loaders and related parts. Engines design, manufacture and marketing of engines for Caterpillar Machinery, electric power generation systems; on highway vehicles and locomotives; marine, petroleum, construction, industrial, agricultural and other applications; and related parts. Reciprocating engines meet power needs ranging from 5 to over 22,000 horsepower (4 to over 16 200 kilowatts). Turbines range from 1,600 to 19,500 horsepower (1 000 to 14 500 kilowatts). Financial Products financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment, as well as some financing for Caterpillar sales to dealers. Financing plans include operating and finance leases, installment sale contracts, working capital loans and wholesale financing plans. The division also provides various forms of insurance to customers and dealers to help support the purchase and lease of our equipment. This line of business consists primarily of Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial) and Caterpillar Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Cat Insurance) and their subsidiaries.

Internal engine transfers are valued at prices comparable to those for unrelated parties. FOURTH QUARTER 2002 COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2001 Fourth quarter 2002 sales and revenues were $5.38 billion compared to $5.10 billion in 2001. The increase of more than 5 percent was due to a $180 million improvement in price realization, about half of which was due to the favorable impact of currency and higher sales volume. Price realization is defined as the net impact of price changes, sales variances and currency fluctuations on sales. Sales variances include items such as warranty, special retail and wholesale incentive programs and manufacturer and cash discounts. Profit for the fourth quarter 2002 was $305 million or 88 cents per share compared to $167 million or 48 cents per share in the fourth quarter 2001. Excluding the $97 million after tax impact of charges recorded in 2001 for sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and costs for planned employment reductions, earnings per share increased 16 percent. The $90 million favorable impact of improved price realization (excluding currency) plus the impact of lower SG&A and R&D expenses were partially offset by continuing manufacturing inefficiencies related to volume shifts at most U.S. engine manufacturing facilities. Application of the goodwill non amortization provisions of SFAS 142 resulted in a favorable pretax impact on earnings of $22 million for the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by a $14 million pretax increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense. The increase was a result of lower plan asset returns in recent years and assumed discount rates used in 2002 compared to 2001, partially offset by the favorable pretax impact of other postretirement benefit plan changes made in the second quarter. These changes impacted U.S. employees only and included an increase in retiree cost sharing of health care benefits, elimination of company payments for Medicare part B premiums and significant reductions in retiree life insurance. MACHINERY AND ENGINES Machinery sales were $3.15 billion, an increase of $352 million or 13 percent from fourth quarter 2001. Sales volume for the quarter increased 9 percent from a year ago, mainly due to year over year changes in dealer inventories. In the fourth quarter of 2001, dealers decreased machine inventories about 12 percent. In the fourth quarter of 2002, dealer inventories increased 3 percent; however, year end 2002 inventories compared to current selling rates were lower than year earlier levels in all regions. Page 18 Engine sales were $1.84 billion, a decrease of $98 million or 5 percent from fourth quarter 2001. Sales volume for the quarter decreased 9 percent from a year ago. While on highway truck and bus engine sales were flat, engine sales into the electric power, petroleum and marine sectors decreased about 10 percent due to reduced corporate profits and continued business investment uncertainties in these industries. Operating Profit Fourth Quarter (Millions of dollars) 2002 2001 Machinery $ 351 $ 137 Engines 26 39 $ 377 $ 176 * * Includes $153 million of charges for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and costs for planned employment reductions. These charges were split $98 million and $55 million to machinery and engines, respectively. Caterpillar operations are highly integrated; therefore, the company uses a number of allocations to determine lines of business operating profit. Machinery operating profit increased $214 million from fourth quarter 2001. Excluding the $98 million impact of charges for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and cost for planned employment reductions, operating profit increased $116 million or 49 percent. Higher sales volume contributed about $60 million of the improvement, with the remainder due to improved price realization (excluding the impact of currency) and cost reduction. Engine operating profit decreased $13 million from fourth quarter 2001. Excluding the $55 million impact of charges for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and cost for planned employment reductions, operating profit decreased $68 million or 72 percent. Lower sales volume of large reciprocating engines, volume related manufacturing inefficiencies and non conformance penalties for on highway truck and bus engines reduced operating profit by approximately $110 million. This was partially offset by improved price realization (excluding currency) and cost reduction. Interest expense was $10 million higher than a year ago primarily due to increased long term borrowings and less capitalized interest year over year. Other income/expense was income of $43 million compared to income of $42 million last year. FINANCIAL PRODUCTS Financial Products revenues for the fourth quarter were $431 million, up $16 million or 4 percent compared with fourth quarter 2001. The favorable impact of approximately $60 million due to the continued portfolio growth of finance receivables and leases at Cat Financial was partially offset by the approximately $44 million unfavorable impact of generally lower interest rates on finance receivables.

Internal engine transfers are valued at prices comparable to those for unrelated parties. Page 20 Before tax profit for Financial Products was $68 million, down $14 million or 17 percent from fourth quarter 2001, primarily due to lower gains on the securitization of receivables of $9 million before tax at Cat Financial and lower income (mostly investment income) of $9 million before tax at Cat Insurance. INCOME TAXES Fourth quarter tax expense reflects an estimated annual tax rate of 28 percent for 2002 and 32 percent for 2001 resulting from a change in the geographic mix of profits. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES The companys share of unconsolidated affiliated companies profits increased $6 million from fourth quarter a year ago, primarily due to improved profitability of Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. 2002 COMPARED WITH 2001 For the full year, the company achieved sales and revenues of $20.15 billion compared to $20.45 billion in 2001. This decline of about 1 percent was due to lower sales volume of about $680 million, partially offset by improved price realization of approximately $300 million. About half of the price realization improvement was due to the favorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar on sales in other currencies, primarily the euro and Australian dollar. Profit for the full year was $798 million or $2.30 per share, compared to $805 million or $2.32 per share, down less than 1 percent from 2001. Excluding the $97 million after tax impact of charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and cost for planned employment reductions, profit declined 12 percent. The combined effect of favorable price realization and net favorable currency of approximately $250 million was more than offset by lower sales volume and related manufacturing inefficiencies. Application of the goodwill non amortization provisions of SFAS 142 resulted in a favorable before tax impact on 2002 earnings of $85 million. This was more than offset by a $93 million before tax increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense. This increase was a result of lower plan asset returns in recent years, partially offset by the favorable before tax impact of other postretirement benefit plan changes made in the second quarter of 2002. These changes impacted U.S. employees only and included an increase in retiree cost sharing of health care benefits, elimination of company payments for Medicare part B premiums and significant reductions in retiree life insurance. MACHINERY AND ENGINES Machinery sales were $11.98 billion, a decrease of $183 million or 2 percent from 2001. Sales volume for the year decreased 4 percent from 2001. Higher sales in Asia/Pacific were due to higher retail demand. Sales in North America, EAME and Latin America declined due to lower retail demand. Sales were also affected by changes in dealer inventories. In 2001, dealers decreased machine inventories about 7 percent. In 2002, dealer inventories increased by about 3 percent; however, year end 2002 inventories compared to current selling rates were lower than year earlier levels in all regions. Engine sales were $6.67 billion, a decrease of $196 million or 3 percent from 2001. Sales volume for the year decreased 4 percent from 2001. Caterpillar truck engine sales rose 36 percent due to a surge in demand from North American truck OEMs for heavy duty truck engines prior to the October 2002 emissions deadline and improved truck fleet operating profits. Sales into the petroleum sector increased 4 percent as higher sales of turbine engines more than offset a decline in sales of reciprocating engines. These increases were more than offset by 30 percent lower sales to the electric power sector, where financial uncertainties and depressed operating profits within the electric utility, technology and telecommunications industries impacted demand. Page 21 Operating Profit (Millions of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Machinery $ 932 $ 849 $ 1,001 Engines 175 348 667 $ 1,107 $ 1,197 * $ 1,668 * Includes $153 million of charges for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and costs for planned employment reductions. These charges were split $98 million and $55 million to machinery and engines, respectively. Caterpillar operations are highly integrated; therefore, the company uses a number of allocations to determine lines of business operating profit. Machinery operating profit increased $83 million, or 10 percent from 2001. Excluding the $98 million impact of charges for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and cost for planned employment reductions, operating profit decreased $15 million or 2 percent. The favorable profit impact of price realization, net impact of currency and lower SG&A expenses were more than offset by the profit impact of lower sales volume and related manufacturing inefficiencies. Application of the goodwill non amortization provisions of SFAS 142 resulted in a favorable impact on 2002 machinery operating profit of approximately $10 million. This was more than offset by a $62 million before tax increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense. Engine operating profit decreased $173 million, or 50 percent from 2001. Excluding the $55 million impact of charges for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and cost for planned employment reductions, operating profit decreased $228 million or 57 percent. Increased turbine and on highway truck and bus engine volumes and improved price realization improved operating profit by approximately $140 million. These favorable items were more than offset by the profit impact of lower sales volume of large reciprocating engines, volume related manufacturing inefficiencies and nonconformance penalties for on highway truck and bus engines. Application of the goodwill non amortization provisions of SFAS 142 resulted in a favorable impact on 2002 engine operating profit of approximately $75 million. This was partially offset by a $31 million before tax increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense. Interest expense was $6 million lower in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to lower interest rates on short term borrowings. Other income/expense improved by $87 million year over year primarily due to the absence of foreign currency losses and lower expenses related to the sales of receivables to Cat Financial. Page 22 Supplemental Information (Millions of dollars) 2002 2001 2000 Identifiable Assets: Machinery $ 10,793 $ 10,121 $ 9,602 Engines 7,300 7,154 6,952 Total $ 18,093 $ 17,275 $ 16,554 Capital Expenditures: Machinery $ 393 $ 616 $ 573 Engines 305 493 327 Total $ 698 $ 1,109 $ 900 Depreciation and Amortization: Machinery $ 437 $ 424 $ 419 Engines 348 411 394 Total $ 785 $ 835 $ 813 Caterpillar operations are highly integrated; therefore, the company uses a number of allocations to determine lines of business financial data. FINANCIAL PRODUCTS Financial Products revenues for 2002 were $1.68 billion, up $33 million or 2 percent compared with 2001. A favorable impact of approximately $205 million due to a $2.1 billion increase in the portfolio at Cat Financial and an increase in third party insurance premiums and fees earned of approximately $21 million at Cat Insurance was mostly offset by the impact of generally lower interest rates on finance receivables at Cat Financial. Before tax profit was $287 million, down $58 million or 17 percent from 2001. A $41 million before tax charge of "other than temporary" declines in the market value of securities in the investment portfolio at Cat Insurance resulted from poor overall market performance. Also, there was less securitization related income of approximately $28 million before tax and higher operating expenses of $17 million before tax at Cat Financial. These items were partially offset by higher rental income, net of depreciation, of $30 million before tax at Cat Financial and higher underwriting income of $7 million before tax at Cat Insurance. INCOME TAXES Tax expense reflects an estimated annual tax rate of 28 percent for 2002 and 32 percent for 2001 resulting from a change in the geographic mix of profits. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES The companys share of unconsolidated affiliated companies profits decreased $7 million from a year ago, primarily due to losses at Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. resulting from depressed construction equipment demand in Japan. UPDATE 2001 CHARGES In 2001, we recorded charges of $153 million ($97 million after tax). These charges were for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and costs for planned employment reductions. Page 23 During 2002, we reduced the Challenger exit cost reserve by $38 million, primarily for cash outlays for research and development expenses and manufacturing equipment in accordance with the contract with AGCO. We reduced the Shrewsbury redundancy reserve by $6 million for separation benefits for 225 employees. As planned, the U.S. employment reduction was achieved entirely through voluntary retirements. As a result, the reserve of $34 million was reclassified to our pension accounts upon completion of the retirement program. Future cash outlays for contractual commitments for the Challenger line of approximately $2 million per year will continue through 2008. Most of the diesel engine production at our Shrewsbury, England plant ceased in 2002; however, it has taken longer than anticipated to finalize the design of one replacement engine. As a result, some diesel engine production at Shrewsbury will continue through 2003. The reserve will be reduced as redundancy and exit costs are incurred through 2003.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Dealer Machine Sales to End Users and Deliveries to Dealer Rental Operations Worldwide dealer sales (including both sales to end users and deliveries to dealer rental operations) declined 8 percent from 2001. The capital spending environment remained weak in the industrial countries of North America and Europe, the result of slow economic growth, a delayed recovery in corporate profitability, the crisis in corporate governance and uncertainty associated with rising geopolitical tensions in the second half of the year. Dealer sales were also impacted by reduced cash flow in the metal and coal mining industries, which depressed worldwide equipment sales to these industries. Dealer sales (including both sales to end users and deliveries to dealer rental operations) in North America declined 10 percent from 2001, the same as industry demand. Caterpillars share of industry sales remained at year earlier levels. Dealer sales declined in both the United States, down 11 percent, and Canada, down 5 percent. For the region, sales increased 2 percent in the heavy construction sector due to higher sales to the U.S. military, spurred by increased defense spending, and for airport construction. In addition, sales to highway construction remained strong, as public infrastructure construction remained at high levels. Sales to the quarry and aggregates sector were up 10 percent, due primarily to an increase in Caterpillars share of industry sales. Sales growth in these two sectors was more than offset by a 37 percent reduction in sales to mining, especially coal. Sales to the general construction sector declined 9 percent due to reductions in dealer rental deliveries as well as reduced purchases by residential and non residential builders. Page 24 Dealer sales in EAME declined 9 percent due to 14 percent lower sales in Europe. General business conditions in Europe were weak due to slow economic growth. Sales increased in the Commonwealth of Independent States, up 7 percent, and Africa & Middle East, up 1 percent. For the region, sales to the heavy construction sector increased about 5 percent due to new product shipments, major pipeline projects in Russia and infrastructure projects in the Middle East. Sales to quarry and aggregate producers were up 6 percent as well. These increases were more than offset by 21 percent lower sales to the general construction sector. Sales were also lower to industrial, down 22 percent; and mining, down 13 percent. In Asia/Pacific, dealer sales increased 7 percent, led by a strong 45 percent gain in China, as economic growth was good and public infrastructure spending increased. For the region, sales were 28 percent higher in the heavy construction sector and industrial sector sales grew 43 percent. Sales also increased to the general construction sector, up 7 percent; and the quarry and aggregates sector, up 14 percent. These gains more than offset 13 percent lower sales to the mining sector, resulting from sharp cutbacks in purchases by coal mining companies. Dealer sales in Latin America declined 5 percent. Sales in Mexico increased 20 percent due to an expansion in overall construction activity, and sales in Brazil increased 14 percent due to good economic growth in the first half of the year. However, these increases were more than offset by declines in Argentina, down 88 percent, Peru, down 34 percent and Chile, down 19 percent. Sales declined sharply in Argentina due to political uncertainty while sales in Peru and Chile declined due to reduced cash flow in the metal mining industry. For the region, sales were up 8 percent in the heavy construction sector, mostly due to major pipeline projects. This gain was more than offset by 25 percent lower sales to the mining sector, especially metals, as well as a 6 percent decline in sales to the general construction sector. Dealer Inventories of New Machines Worldwide dealer new machine inventories at year end 2002 were about 3 percent higher than 2001 levels. Inventories increased in North America, up 6 percent; Asia/Pacific, up 9 percent; and EAME, up 4 percent. Dealer inventory declined 20 percent in Latin America. Despite the overall increase in dealer inventories, inventories compared to current selling rates were lower than year earlier levels in all regions. Engine Sales to End Users and OEMs Worldwide engine sales to dealer customers and OEMs were up 1 percent in 2002. Sales to the on highway truck and bus sector rose 38 percent and sales to the petroleum sector rose 5 percent, more than offsetting 21 percent lower sales to the electric power sector and 6 percent lower sales to the marine sector. Similar to the market fundamentals discussed above for construction machinery, global engine sales were impacted by the weak capital spending environment in industrialized countries and depressed operating profits and heightened investor uncertainties concerning new electric utility and energy investments. In North America, Caterpillar sales of on highway truck and bus engines rose 38 percent but were more than offset by lower sales in electric power, down 36 percent; petroleum, down 32 percent; and marine, down 42 percent. North American sales were impacted by sluggish economic growth, weak corporate profits, continuing economic uncertainties and delayed new investments. Caterpillar widened its leadership position in the North American on highway truck and bus industry; Caterpillars share of industry demand rose significantly for both heavy duty and midrange truck engines. The heavy duty truck industry and Caterpillar heavy duty truck engine demand were substantially higher than we originally expected for 2002. We estimate about 40,000 extra heavy duty trucks were built in 2002 to accommodate an artificial surge in customer demand for trucks with engines built before the October 2002 emissions deadline. This artificial demand added an estimated $200 million to Caterpillars 2002 truck engine sales, repr esenting about 50 percent of the total year over year sales increase to the on highway truck and bus sector. In EAME, overall sales declined 3 percent, with a 30 percent increase in demand for larger reciprocating and turbine engines used in the petroleum sector more than offset by 16 and 14 percent lower sales into the electric power and marine sectors, respectively. Electric power and marine engine sales were impacted by weakening economic trends in Western Europe and increased business uncertainty which delayed new business investment decisions. Page 25 Sales in Asia/Pacific rose 20 percent with sales gains in all sectors except electric power where sales declined 17 percent. Sales of large reciprocating and turbine engines used in the petroleum sector surged 62 percent, as developing countries in Asia/Pacific and Latin America increased oil and gas exploration and development to raise local energy production and offset higher costs of imported fuels. Sales in Latin America increased 60 percent with sales gains in all sectors and pronounced strength in large reciprocating and turbine engine sales into the petroleum and marine sectors, which rose 48 and 242 percent, respectively. 2001 COMPARED WITH 2000 Sales and revenues for 2001 were $20.45 billion, 1 percent more than 2000. The increase was due to higher sales volume of about $390 million and increased Financial Products revenues of approximately $160 million, which were partially offset by approximately $275 million of lower price realization. More than 90 percent of the price realization detriment was due to the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on sales in other currencies, primarily the euro and Australian dollar. Profit of $805 million, including charges of $153 million ($97 million after tax) for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and cost for planned employment reductions, was down $248 million. Excluding these charges, profit was $902 million, down $151 million or 14 percent. The combined effect of higher sales volume and a net favorable currency impact of approximately $225 million was more than offset by cost inefficiencies resulting from sharp volume shifts at some manufacturing facilities and higher SG&A expenses related to spending for future growth and improving long term cost structure. The net favorable currency impact occurred as the negative impact of currency on sales was more than offset by a positive impact on costs. MACHINERY AND ENGINES Machinery sales were $12.16 billion, an increase over 2000 of $301 million resulting from a 3 percent increase in sales volume. Sales were higher in all regions except Latin America, which was about flat. In North America, sales increases due to higher share of industry sales and a slower rate of dealer inventory reduction more than offset reduced industry demand. In EAME and Asia/Pacific, improved retail demand more than offset the impact of reductions in dealer inventory. Sales in Latin America remained near 2000 levels as higher retail demand offset reductions in dealer inventory. Engine sales were $6.87 billion, a decrease of $187 million or 3 percent from 2000 even though sales volume was flat. Unfavorable price realization resulting from competitive pressures in North America combined with the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on sales in other currencies caused the sales decline. Higher sales in the electric power, petroleum and marine sectors were offset by a substantial drop in truck engine sales. Machinery operating profit decreased $152 million from 2000. The favorable impact of higher sales volume and the net favorable impact of currency were more than offset by higher costs, including charges of $98 million for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and cost for planned employment reductions, employment related cost increases and higher energy costs. Engine operating profit decreased $319 million from 2000. The decline was primarily due to lower price realization, manufacturing inefficiencies related to sharp swings in production levels and charges of $55 million for the sale of the Challenger agricultural tractor line, plant closing and consolidations and cost for planned employment reductions. Interest expense was $7 million lower than a year ago as lower effective borrowing rates more than offset the impact of higher borrowings. Other income/expense improved by $38 million due to lower foreign currency losses (primarily the British pound) in 2001. Page 26 FINANCIAL PRODUCTS Revenues for 2001 were a record $1.65 billion, up $180 million or 12 percent compared with 2000 (excluding revenue transactions with Machinery and Engines, revenues increased $161 million or 13 percent). The increase resulted primarily from a $1.1 billion increase in the portfolio at Cat Financial. Before tax profit increased $67 million or 24 percent from 2000. Record profit at Cat Financial resulted from an approximate one percentage point increase in the spread on the receivables portfolio and increased gains of $31 million on sales of receivables. The wider interest rate spread on the portfolio was principally a result of 2001s interest rate environment, where the continuing rapid decrease in rates allowed Cat Financials debt rates to decrease more rapidly than the portfolio rates because we are not 100% "match funded." As rates stabilize or increase our interest rate spread is expected to narrow accordingly. The increase in gains on sales of receivables at Cat Financial was due to North American dealer trade receivables purchased from Caterpillar Inc. that were paid earlier than estimated at their purchase date. Cat Financial purchases trade receivables each week at discounts that are expected to yield a market rate of interest over their term. Because the discounts are based on estimates as to when the receivables will be paid, the actual yield on the receivables can be higher or lower than the rates used to determine the discounts. In 2001 the yield was higher because the receivables paid substantially earlier than estimated. However, similar results are not expected in future periods. INCOME TAXES Excluding the tax effect of charges reported in 2001 for the sale of the Challenger agricultural line, plant closing and consolidations and cost for planned employment reductions and the favorable tax adjustment of $39 million at Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. in 2000, tax expense in both years reflects an effective tax rate of 32 percent. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES The companys share of unconsolidated affiliated companies results increased $31 million from a year ago, primarily due to stronger results at Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. 2001 CHARGES In December 2001, we signed an agreement with AGCO to sell the design, assembly and marketing of the new MT Series of Caterpillars Challenger high tech farm tractors during the first quarter of 2002. By selling the Challenger we will avoid the substantial new investment in distribution that would be required to make this product profitable. The sale will also provide our distribution network the expanded line of agricultural products it needs to be successful. A total charge of $81 million was recognized for the Challenger sale. These charges reflect the provisions of the agreement with AGCO and are comprised of the following: $32 million for write downs of land, buildings and equipment at our DeKalb, Illinois, facility to fair market value based on the negotiated contract price with AGCO. $49 million for exit costs. The contract with AGCO requires that we complete the design of the new Challenger tractor, ensure a successful market launch and pay for the remaining capital assets required for the production of the tractor. These amounts reflect our estimate of costs to fulfill our contract obligations and will be incurred in 2002. Also included in exit costs are contractual obligations that will remain after the sale to AGCO but will provide no benefit to Caterpillar. These obligations range from one to seven years. Page 27 In December 2001, we announced plans to cease production of diesel engines at the Perkins Engines Shrewsbury, England plant by the end of 2002. Production will be reallocated to other Caterpillar engine facilities to better leverage technology and capacity. Upon closure of the plant, we expect an annual benefit to cost of goods sold of approximately $16 million. This represents lower overhead and other fixed manufacturing expenses as the production moves to other existing Caterpillar locations. A total charge of $30 million was recognized for the closing and comprised the following: $16 million for write downs of land, buildings and equipment to fair market value as determined by third party appraisers. $10 million of separation costs for termination of 495 employees at the Shrewsbury plant. These benefits were communicated to impacted employees in December. Exit costs of $4 million associated with closing the facility. In December 2001, we announced plans to reduce U.S. salaried and management employment by 433 people at selected business units during the first half of 2002. These reductions are being made to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in support of our long term growth and profitability goals. We expect this reduction to be achieved through voluntary early retirements but if the reduction goal is not met, we will use involuntary separations. The charge of $34 million for this program reflects the cost of retirement incentives. We expect lower annual labor costs of approximately $35 million after completion of the employment reduction. Other charges of $8 million were for write downs of two manufacturing buildings, one at our Decatur, Illinois, facility and one at our Kiel, Germany, facility. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of funds The company generates its capital resources primarily through operations. Consolidated operating cash flow was $2.37 billion for 2002, compared with $1.99 billion for 2001. The increase is primarily the result of concerted efforts to reduce inventory and other working capital in response to the current economic environment. We anticipate that the majority of future capital resource requirements will be funded by operating cash flow, which is largely sourced from profits. See our "Outlook" in Item 7 of this Form 10 K. Total debt as of December 31, 2002 was $17.7 billion, an increase of $1.08 billion from year end 2001. Debt related to Machinery and Engines decreased $59 million, due to improved operating cash flow and lower capital expenditures. Debt related to Financial Products increased $1.14 billion due to portfolio growth at Cat Financial. We have a global credit facility of $4.55 billion available to both Machinery and Engines and Cat Financial to support commercial paper programs. Cat Financial may use up to 90 percent of the available facility subject to a maximum debt to equity and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Machinery and Engines may use up to 100 percent of the available facility subject to a minimum level of net worth. Based on these restrictions, and the allocation decisions of available credit made by management, the portion of the facility available to Cat Financial at December 31, 2002, was $3.95 billion. The facility is c omprised of two components, $2,425 million expiring in September 2003 and $2,125 million expiring in September 2006. The facility expiring in September 2003 has a provision which allows Caterpillar to obtain a one year loan in September 2003 that matures in September 2004. Page 28 Our total credit commitments as of December 31, 2002 were: (Millions of dollars) Consolidated Machineryand Engines FinancialProducts Credit lines available: Global credit facility $ 4,550 $ 4,550 $ 3,950 Other external 1,353 542 811 Intercompany 500 826 Total credit lines available 5,903 5,592 5,587 Utilized credit 238 64 174 Unused credit $ 5,665 $ 5,528 $ 5,413 We also generate funding through the securitization of receivables. In 2002, we generated $1,696 million and $641 million of capital resources from the securitization of trade and finance receivables, respectively. As of December 31, 2002, we had trade and finance receivables of $2,904 million and $13,462 million, respectively. We do not generate material funding through structured finance transactions. Committed funds The company has committed cash outflow related to long term debt, operating lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations and other contractual obligations. Minimum payments for these long term obligations are: (Millions of dollars) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 After2007 Total Long Term Debt $ 3,912 $ 2,781 $ 1,492 $ 1,212 $ 1,022 $ 5,089 $ 15,508 Operating Leases 185 154 102 72 53 300 866 Other Long Term Obligations 64 66 56 53 52 115 406 Unconditional Purchase Obligations 62 64 64 52 24 103 369 Total Contractual Obligations $ 4,223 $ 3,065 $ 1,714 $ 1,389 $ 1,151 $ 5,607 $ 17,149 We did not have contingent liabilities with more than a remote chance of occurrence at December 31, 2002. Machinery and Engines Operating cash flow was $1.70 billion for 2002, compared with $1.51 billion for 2001. The improvement came mainly from focused efforts to reduce inventory and working capital requirements during 2002. Capital expenditures, excluding equipment leased to others, during 2002 were $693 million, a decrease of $378 million from 2001 due to tight controls on spending. On April 23, 2002, $250 million of 40 year debt, priced at 6.95 percent, was sold. The proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes. Financial Products Operating cash flow was $649 million for 2002, compared with $590 million for 2001. The increase was primarily due to improved cash from profit before depreciation and amortization for 2002. Cash used to purchase equipment leased to others was $1.04 billion during 2002 compared to $830 million for 2001. In addition, net cash used for finance receivables was $1.16 billion for 2002, compared to $.8 billion for 2001. At December 31, 2002, finance receivables past due over 30 days were 3.5 percent, compared with 3.9 percent at the end of 2001. Page 29 Financial Products debt was $13.96 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of $1.14 billion from December 31, 2001, and primarily comprised $9.95 billion of medium term notes, $174 million of short term notes payable to banks, $32 million of long term notes payable to banks, $38 million of loans from a company owned partnership, $255 million of money market funds and $3.50 billion of commercial paper. During the second quarter of 2001, $500 million of five year debt, priced at 5.95 percent, was sold. The proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes and to lower overall debt costs. The ratio of debt to equity of Cat Financial was 7.8:1 at December 31, 2002, compared with 7.7:1 at December 31, 2001.

The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair market values for goodwill impairment tests, impairment of available for sale securities, and reserves for warranty, product liability and insurance losses, postemployment benefits, post sale discounts, credit losses and certain charges. We use the following methods and assumptions in determining our estimates: Residual values for leased assets Determined based on the product, specifications, application and hours of usage. Each product has its own model for evaluation that includes market value cycles and forecasts. Consideration is also given to the number of machines that will be returned from lease during a given time frame. Fair market values for goodwill impairment tests Determined for each reporting unit by discounting projected cash flow for the upcoming five years and adding a year five residual value based upon a market Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) multiple. Impairment of available for sale securities Securities are reviewed monthly to identify market values below cost of 20 percent or more. If a decline for a debt security is in excess of 20 percent for 6 months, the investment is evaluated to determine if the decline is due to general declines in the marketplace or if the investment has been impaired and should be written down to market value pursuant to SFAS 115. After the 6 month period, debt securities with declines from cost in excess of 20 percent are evaluated monthly for impairment. For equity securities, if a decline from cost of 20 percent or more continues for a 12 month period, an other than temporary impairment is recognized without continued analysis. Warranty reserve Determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, historical claim rates are developed using a 12 month rolling average of actual warranty expense. These rates are applied to the field population and dealer inventory to determine the reserve. Product liability and insurance loss reserve Determined based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Postemployment benefit reserve Determined in accordance with SFAS 87, 106 and 112 using the assumptions detailed in Note 11 in Item 15 of this Form 10 K/A. Page 30 Post sale discount reserve The company extends numerous merchandising programs that provide discounts to dealers as products are sold to end users. The reserve is determined based on historical data adjusted for known changes in merchandising programs. Credit loss reserve Determined by applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the condition of the economy and trends in past due accounts. Charges reserve Determined in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation. 2001 charges discussed in Note 24 in Item 15 of this Form 10 K/A were estimated in accordance with SFAS 5 and 121 and EITF 94 3. We have incorporated many years of historical data into the determination of each of these estimates. We have a proven history of using accurate estimates and sound assumptions to calculate and record appropriate reserves and residual values. EMPLOYMENT At December 31, 2002, Caterpillars worldwide employment was 68,990 compared with 72,004 one year ago. The company reduced employment by 3,457 or about 5 percent during 2002 before the impact of acquisitions, which added 443 people.

Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We are cleaning up hazardous waste at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is likely we will pay clean up costs at a site and those costs can be estimated, the costs are charged against our earnings. In making that estimate, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies and others. The amount set aside for environmental cleanup is not material and is included in Statement 3 under "Accrued expenses" in Item 15 of this Form 10 K/A. If a range of liability estimates is available on a particular site, we accrue the lower end of that range. Page 31 We cannot estimate costs on sites in the very early stages of cleanup. Currently, we have five sites in the very early stages of cleanup, and there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for cleanup will be required. Pursuant to a consent decree Caterpillar entered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the company was required to meet certain emission standards by October 2002. The decree provides that if the manufacturers were unable to meet the standards at that time they would be required to pay a non conformance penalty (NCP) on each engine sold that did not meet the standard. The amount of the NCP would be based on how close to meeting the standard the engine came the more out of compliance the higher the penalty. The company began shipping lower emission engines in October 2002 as a bridge until fully compliant Advanced Combustion Emission Reduction Technology (ACERT) engines are introduced in 2003. The consent decree also provided the ability to "bank" emissions credits prior to October 2002 that could be used to offset non conforming engines produced after January 1, 2003. That is, if a company was able to produce and sell engines that were below the applicable standard prior to October 2002, then the company could apply the emission credits created by those engines to engines produced after January 1, 2003 that do not meet the consent decree standard. For example, an engine produced and sold prior to October 2002 that produced 3.5 grams of NOx as compared to 4.0 gram standard would create a 0.5 gram credit. This credit would be "banked" to be used to offset the NOx deficiency of an engine produced after January 1, 2003 that did not meet the consent decree standard. Given this scenario, a company could produce and sell a 3.0 gram engine in 2003 without paying an NCP even though the engine exceeds the 2.5 gram standard. Caterpillar has a legal righ t, as described in the consent decree, to use its banked credits as offsets against NCPs for non compliant engines produced after December 31, 2002. The EPA has approved the process by which the credits are calculated. We produced and sold 70,399 medium heavy duty engines prior to October 2002 that yielded emissions below the applicable standard for that period, resulting in 20,987.8 Mg of medium heavy duty banked credits. We expect to produce approximately 26,800 non conforming medium heavy duty engines after January 1, 2003, but we do not expect to pay any NCPs on these medium duty engines in 2003 due to our banked credits. We produced and sold 958 heavy duty engines in 2002 resulting in 1,230.2 Mg of heavy duty banked credits. Of the approximately 25,800 non conforming heavy duty engines we expect to build after January 1, 2003, these banked credits are expected to offset the NCPs on approximately 3,000 of these units. We began production of medium heavy duty ACERT engines complying with the EPA emissions standards in early 2003. Caterpillar received certification from the EPA in January 2003 for the C9 diesel engine, the first of our new engines equipped with ACERT Technology. We began shipping of the C9 which was certified to the more stringent Transit Bus standards in March. We received certification for our second ACERT equipped model, the C7 in March and this engine will be in production in June of 2003. We anticipate that our heavy heavy duty models the C13 and C15 (the ACERT versions of the current C 12 and C 15, respectively) will be in full production by October and the C11 (the ACERT version of the current C 10) will be in full production by December after the EPA has certified each engine. As a result, we do not anticipate paying NCPs beyond 2003. The certification process is described in the consent decree and the regulations, and includes the following: The durability of the engine is established through testing to determine if the engine emissions change with time. An emissions deterioration factor is determined that represents the amount of emission deterioration that would be expected over the useful life of the engine. An emission data engine is tested according to the regulations. Emission levels are determined on various steady state and transient tests. The results from the two tests are submitted to the EPA in a certification application as proof that the engine meets the requirements along with additional information and a request that a certificate be granted. Page 32 The EPA reviews the application and if all the regulatory requirements are met, a certificate is issued. If the engine exceeds the standard, the EPA issues a certificate for either a banked or an NCP engine. The NCP engine certificate requires Production Compliance Auditing (PCA) testing. After receipt of the EPA certificate manufacturing and shipment of the certified engines can begin. Each engine is labeled to indicate that it is certified. Our expense for NCPs was $40 million in 2002. This amount was based on levels that we believed the engines would perform when tested. For 2002, we paid NCPs on 6,195 heavy duty units and 7,198 medium heavy duty units, and in 2003 we estimate we will pay NCPs on 22,858 heavy duty units. The actual NCP amount will not be known until final testing with the EPA is completed with all models during 2003. Our estimates of the NCP amounts are based on our knowledge of how each of the engine models is expected to perform in PCA testing. Caterpillar can make fairly accurate predictions of the emissions profiles of its engines due to its engineering knowledge, development process, and prior testing of its engines during development. PCA testing on medium heavy duty engines has now been completed; PCA testing on heavy heavy duty engines is on going. Therefore, while PCA testing has not been concluded, we are confident that our NCP and credit consumption estimates will be fairly accurate. Aside from $142 million in customary research and development expenses, emissions standard changes negatively impacted our 2002 financial results by $24 million ($17 million after tax) as NCPs ($40 million pre tax), product cost increases and ramp up production costs ($4 million pre tax) were partially offset by price increases for these engines ($20 million pre tax). We recorded the $40 million for NCPs when the bridge engines were produced, and either have paid or will pay the EPA from an escrow account no later than 30 days after PCA testing on an engine class is complete. For example, on January 31, 2003, Caterpillar deposited $41.4 million (the recorded $40 million based on our estimates plus an additional $1.4 million following the completion of PCA testing) with an escrow agent for estimated NCPs related to fourth quarter 2002 bridge engine production. This included $17 million for medium heavy duty engine models and $24.4 million for heavy duty engine models. After completion of EPA testing of "hig h horsepower" medium heavy duty engines, on March 11, 2003 Caterpillar released $8 million from the escrow account to the EPA. After completion of testing of the remaining medium heavy duty engine models, on March 25, 2003 Caterpillar released the remaining $9 million from the medium heavy duty engine escrow account and paid an additional $900,000 to the EPA because the tested level of NCPs for that engine family was slightly higher per engine than was anticipated at the time of the January 31 escrow deposit. The following table reflects the 2002 impact of the emission standard changes: 2002 (millions of dollars) Price (Engines Sold x Price Increase) $ 20 Incremental Costs (Cost of Additional Materials) (4) NCPs (Engines Sold x Projected NCP per Engine) (40) Net Effect Pre Tax $ (24) Tax 7 Net Effect After Tax $ (17) In addition to the above, the consent decree required Caterpillar to pay a fine of $25 million, which was expensed in 1998 and to make investments totaling $35 million in environmental related products by July 7, 2007. Total qualifying investments to date for these projects is $21 million, of which $10 million was made in 2002. A future benefit is expected to be realized from these environmental projects related to Caterpillars ability to capitalize on the technologies it developed in complying with its environmental project obligations. In short, Caterpillar expects to receive a positive net return on the environmental projects by being able to market the technology it developed. Page 33 As of December 31, 2002 we expect the net unfavorable impact of emission standard changes in 2003 to be no more than 2002 as we estimate that significantly higher NCPs (approximately $93 million pre tax), product cost increases and ramp up production costs (approximately $76 million pre tax), will be partially offset by price increases for bridge and ACERT engines (approximately $153 million pre tax). For example, we estimate that we will sell 8,728 C 12 engines in 2003 that will be subject to NCPs. We also estimate that the blended (there are multiple models of the C 12) NCP per engine will be $5,103. Caterpillar is not required to make any payment to the EPA for these engines until PCA testing for the engine model has been completed. However, Caterpillar is required to place an amount equal to its estimated NCPs for that engine model into an escrow account on a quarterly basis. As a result, we will record approximately $93 million for NCPs as the bridge engines are produced and once PCA testing is com pleted for an engine model, we will pay the EPA the NCPs on these engine sales out of the established escrow accounts on a quarterly basis. The following table reflects the projected 2003 impact of the emission standard changes: 2003 (millions of dollars) Price (Bridge or ACERT Price Increase x Projected Engine Sales) $ 153 Incremental Costs (Cost of Additional Materials) (76) NCPs (Projected NCP per Engine x Projected Engine Sales banked credits) (93) Net Effect Pre Tax $ (16) Tax 4 Net Effect After Tax $ (12) As reflected in this table, our projections for 2003 are subject to assumptions regarding projected NCPs, price increases and volumes. For example, our estimate of NCPs per engine could change from the $3600 average per heavy duty engine based on the results of on going EPA testing; this testing could impact both the NCP level per engine and the utilization of banked credits. However, we are able to make fairly accurate predictions of the results of the EPA tests due to our engineering knowledge, development process and internal testing during development. Our net price increase for heavy duty bridge engines was successfully implemented on October 1, 2002; this increase was competitive with price increases implemented by other engine manufacturers on that date. With the introduction of ACERT engines in 2003, there will be an additional price increase to truck manufacturers that purchase our engines. This increase has been communicated to the truck manufacturers and is based on the additional value that we expect truck owners to receive from ACERT engines compared to our competitors as a result of better fuel economy, less maintenance and greater durability. The ultimate net price increase we are able to achieve for our ACERT engines is dependent upon marketplace acceptance of these engines versus competitive alternatives. While we estimate volume to the best of our ability, industry volume is an issue out of our control. We will revise our disclosures in future filings accordingly if the actual NCP amount in 2003 vary materially from our projections, if the market unexpectedly will not bear the planned price increase or if our estimated volumes prove to have been materially too conservative or optimistic. Page 34 On August 30, 2002, a World Trade Organization (WTO) arbitration panel determined that the European Union (EU) may impose up to $4.04 billion per year in retaliatory tariffs if the U.S. tax code is not brought into compliance with an August 2001 WTO decision that found the extraterritorial tax (ETI) provisions of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000 constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Since August 2002, the EU has been developing a proposed list of U.S. origin products on which the EU could impose tariffs as high as 100 percent of the value of the product. Negotiations among EU Member States, the European Commission, and the private sector over which products are listed have been intense. That list has not yet been finalized, the EU has not announced that they will impose a retaliatory tariff, and it is unclear the extent to which the Companys products will be subject to a retaliatory tariff but based on what we know today, we do not believe it will materially impact our financial results. Assuming the EU implemented a retaliatory tariff and certain company products were subject to 100 percent tariffs, the companys competitive position in the European market would not be significantly affected. The company has production facilities in the EU, Russia, Asia, and South America that would not be affected by a retaliatory tariff aimed at U.S. origin products. If the EU implemented its proposed retaliatory tariff, increased pressure would be placed on Congress to repeal ETI, possibly during the 108th Congress. Based on current information related to this matter, it is not possible to predict how the U.S. legislative process will affect the companys 2003 tax liability, but based on what we know today, we do not believe the impact, if any, will be material in 2003. On January 16, 2002, Caterpillar commenced an action against Navistar International Transportation Corporation and International Truck and Engine Corporation (Navistar). Caterpillar seeks a declaratory judgment upholding a long term purchase contract plus damages arising from Navistars alleged breach of contract. On January 22, 2003, Caterpillar filed its First Amended Complaint to add four additional defendants and to add claims alleging that two of the new defendants colluded with Navistar to utilize technology misappropriated from Caterpillar. At December 31, 2002, the past due receivable from Navistar related to this case was $104 million. On January 17, 2002, Navistar commenced an action against Caterpillar that alleges we breached various aspects of the long term purchase contract. On April 2, 2002, the Court granted Caterpillars Motion for Involuntary Dismissal of this action; Navistar subsequently asserted its claims as counterclaims in the action Caterpillar file d in Peoria. We believe Navistars claims are without merit, and resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our financial statements. On May 7, 2002, International Truck and Engine Corporation (International) commenced an action against Caterpillar in the Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois that alleges Caterpillar breached various aspects of a long term agreement term sheet. In its third amended complaint, International seeks a declaration from the court that the term sheet constitutes a legally binding contract for the sale of heavy duty engines at specified prices through the end of 2006, alleges that Caterpillar breached the term sheet by raising certain prices effective October 1, 2002, and also alleges that Caterpillar breached an obligation to negotiate a comprehensive long term agreement referenced in the term sheet. International further claims that Caterpillar improperly restricted the supply of heavy duty engines to International from June through September 2002. International seeks damages "in an amount to be determined at trial" and injunctive relief. Caterpillar filed an answer denying Internationals clai ms and has filed a counterclaim seeking a declaration that the term sheet has effectively been terminated. Caterpillar denies Internationals claims and will vigorously contest them. The company further believes that final resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our financial statements. This matter is not related to the breach of contract action brought by Caterpillar against International currently pending in the Circuit Court of Peoria County, Illinois. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS In 2002 we recognized a net pension benefit of $73 million compared with a benefit of $163 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily a result of continued poor performance of the equity markets and lower than expected long term returns on pension plan assets. SFAS 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions" requires companies to use an expected long term rate of return for computing current year pension expense. Differences between the actual and expected returns are amortized into future earnings as actuarial gains and losses. At the end of 2002, unrecognized actuarial losses of $2.56 billion primarily reflect lower than expected returns on our pension plan assets. Page 35 Other postretirement benefit expense was $240 million in 2002, up $3 million from 2001. An increase resulting from several unfavorable items including inflation on health care costs and lower actual return on plan assets was almost entirely offset by changes to our U.S. benefit plans implemented during second quarter 2002. These changes include an increase in retiree cost sharing of health care benefits, elimination of company payments for Medicare part B premiums and significant reductions in retiree life insurance. In total, these changes lowered our existing benefit obligation by approximately $475 million, which will be amortized into earnings over seven years (the average remaining service period of employees affected by the plan changes). In addition to this amortization, our ongoing annual expense will decrease approximately $45 million from the plan changes. A benefit of $75 million reflecting the partial year impact of the plan changes (representing both the amortizatio n and ongoing impact of the changes) was recognized in 2002. Unrecognized actuarial losses for other postretirement plans were $976 million at the end of 2002. These losses reflect lower than expected plan asset returns, higher than expected benefit costs, a decrease in the assumed discount rate and an increase in expected health care inflation. These losses will be amortized into future earnings in accordance with SFAS 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The unrecognized actuarial losses will be impacted in future periods by actual asset returns, actual health care inflation, discount rate changes and other factors that impact pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. SFAS 87 requires the recognition of an Additional Minimum Liability if the market value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation at the end of the plan year. Based on these values, the company increased the Additional Minimum Liability by $892 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. This resulted in a decrease in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (a component of Shareholders Equity on the Statement of Financial Position) of $610 million after tax. During 2002, the company made cash contributions of $135 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans, which make up about 85 percent of the companys total pension liability. The company continues to have adequate liquidity resources to fund plans, as it deems necessary. Future changes to the Additional Minimum Liability will be dependent on several factors including actual returns on our pension plan assets, company contributions, benefit plan changes and our assumed discount rate. Actuarial assumptions have a significant impact on both pension and other postretirement benefit expenses. The effect of a one percentage point change in our primary actuarial assumptions on 2002 benefit costs and year end obligations is included in the table below. Postretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions Sensitivity Following are the effects of a one percentage point change in our primary pension and other postretirement benefit actuarial assumptions on 2002 pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations: 2002 Benefit Cost Year end Benefit Obligation (Millions of dollars) One percentage point increase One percentage point decrease One percentage point increase One percentage point decrease Pension benefits: Assumed discount rate $ (33 ) $ 26 $ (991 ) $ 1,146 Expected rate of compensation increase 29 (25 ) 222 (202 ) Expected long term rate of return on plan assets (93 ) 93 Other postretirement benefits: Assumed discount rate (17 ) 28 (434 ) 485 Expected rate of compensation increase 2 (2 ) 12 (12 ) Expected long term rate of return on plan assets (12 ) 12 Assumed health care cost trend rate 49 (31 ) 272 (230 ) Page 36 The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to todays dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on the Moodys Aa bond yield as of our measurement date, November 30. A similar process is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our non U.S. pension plans. The discount rates used to calculate 2002 benefit plan expense were 7.3 percent for U.S. plans and 5.8 percent for non U.S. plans. The discount rates for 2003 will be 7.0 percent for U.S. plans and 5.4 percent for non U.S. plans. The expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long term salary increases. The 2002 rate was 4.0 percent for U.S. benefit plans and 3.2 percent for non U.S. pension plans. Our U.S. expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our pension assets. Based on historical performance, we add 1 percent to the passive returns due to our active management. A similar process is used to determine this rate for our non U.S. pension plans. The expected long term rates of return used to calculate 2002 benefit plan expense were 9.8 percent for U.S. plans and 7.6 percent for non U.S. plans. The expected long term rates of return for 2003 will be 9.0 percent for U.S. plans and 7.1 percent for non U.S. plans. The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase. To calculate 2002 benefit expense, we assumed an increase of 10.6 percent for 2002. This rate was assumed to decrease gradually to the ultimate health care trend rate of 4.5 percent in 2009. This rate represents 2.5 percent general inflation plus 2.0 percent additional health care inflation. Based on our recent expenses and our forecast of changes, we expect an increase of 9.0 percent during 2003 with no change to the ultimate trend rate. SENSITIVITY Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our Machinery and Engines operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2003 cash flow for our Machinery and Engines operations by $39 million. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $62 million adverse impact on 2002 cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflows and outflows by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity. Since our policy for Financial Products operations is to hedge the foreign exchange risk when the currency of our debt portfolio does not match the currency of our receivable portfolio, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year. The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Interest Rate Sensitivity For our Machinery and Engines operations, we have the option to use interest rate swaps to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed to floating interest rate swaps to fixed rate debt. However, we currently do not have any interest rate swaps. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move (increase) in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect 2003 pretax earnings of Machinery and Engines by $2 million. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $3 million adverse impact on 2002 pretax earnings. This effect is caused by the interest rate fluctuations on our short term debt. Page 37 For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match funding objectives and strategies. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move (increase) in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the 2003 pretax earnings of Financial Products by $15 million. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $15 million adverse impact on 2002 pretax earnings. To estimate the impact of interest rate sensitivity on our income, we compute the difference in baseline and sensitized interest expense over the next 12 months. We determine the baseline interest expense by applying a market interest rate to the unmatched portion of our debt portfolio. The unmatched portion of our portfolio is an estimate of fixed rate assets funded by floating rate liabilities. We incorporate the effects of interest rate swap agreements in the estimate of our unmatched portfolio. We determine the sensi tized interest expense by adding 100 basis points to the market interest rate applied to baseline interest expense and apply this rate to the unmatched portfolio. Our analysis assumes no new fixed rate assets were extended and no further action was taken to alter our current interest rate sensitivity. The effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in actual sales volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates. The actions that management would take in response to such a change are also ignored. If it were possible to quantify this impact, the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above. OUTLOOK Economic and Industry Summary Worldwide economic and geopolitical uncertainties remained at relatively elevated levels in the early weeks of 2003. We expect this will dampen the economic recovery in the first half of 2003, but growth is expected to accelerate in the second half, leading to worldwide growth of about 3 percent for the year as a whole. In this environment, industry opportunity is expected to be about the same as 2002. Our outlook is based on and subject to the following economic and business condition assumptions: (1) the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East remain high, but do not degenerate into a major lengthy armed conflict, (2) the benefits from lower European interest rates offset fiscal tightening in several major European countries, (3) the U.S. Congress approves in early 2003 about $30 billion in current fiscal year transportation funding and additional fiscal stimulus measures are passed by the end of the second quarter and (4) investor confidence improves as corporate earnin gs grow and trust is restored in the reliability of corporate reporting and oversight. North America Geopolitical and federal policy uncertainties in early 2003 are expected to dampen the strength of the first half economic recovery. We assume these uncertainties will diminish and become less of a drag on growth in the second half of 2003. For the year as a whole, we expect economic growth of about 3 percent, supported by low interest rates and fiscal stimulus policies. The U.S. Congress is expected to pass a large fiscal stimulus package in the first half of 2003. The package, combined with the positive impact of previously enacted federal stimulus measures, is expected to more than offset state budget cutbacks, with most of the positive impact in the second half of the year. In addition, improved corporate earnings and cash flows, more accommodating credit conditions and a return to more normal commercial insurance coverage are also expected to provide support for stronger business capital spending in the second half of 2003. Construction activity is expected to be about flat, while industrial an d mining activity is expected to be up about 3 percent. Industry sales of construction, industrial and mining machinery are expected to be about flat. Industry demand for reciprocating and turbine engines is expected to be down about 5 percent. EAME In EAME, we expect economic growth in Europe of about 2 percent, and about 5 percent growth in the CIS, Africa and the Middle East. While a recovery in Europe is expected, it will be restrained by a stronger euro and ongoing fiscal restraint in several major industrial countries. In Africa and the Middle East, oil exporters and precious metal producers are expected to benefit from good price levels, whereas most other commodity prices are expected to remain weak. We expect the CIS to grow at a solid rate, driven mainly by continued strong expansion of the oil and gas industry. Machine industry sales in EAME are expected to be about flat, while engine industry sales are also expected to be about flat. Page 38 Latin America Market conditions in Latin America are expected to be mixed. We expect overall economic growth rates in Mexico and Argentina to improve, leading to higher industry sales. Industry sales in Peru are expected to be about flat. Relatively slow growth in Brazil and Chile and continued political instability in Venezuela are expected to lead to lower industry machine sales in these markets. For Latin America in total, machine and engine industry sales are expected to be down about 10 percent. Asia/Pacific We expect good overall economic growth in the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) based on moderate growth in Australia and continued good growth in the developing economies, particularly southeast Asia, China and India. In Japan, economic and business conditions are expected to continue to be difficult, and machine industry sales are projected to be about flat at cyclically depressed levels. Industry machine sales in the Asia/Pacific region are expected to be up about 10 percent, while engine and turbine industry sales are projected to be down about 5 percent. Company Summary Company sales and revenues are expected to be about the same as 2002. Company sales in EAME are projected to be up about 4 percent, while company sales into Asia/Pacific are expected to be up about 2 percent. In North America, company sales are expected to be down about 3 percent, while company sales in Latin America are expected to be down about 10 percent. Financial Products revenues are expected to increase approximately 10 percent, primarily driven by Cat Financials record portfolio additions in 2002. We anticipate improved operational results will offset most of the $300 million or approximately 60 cents per share of higher retiree pension, health care and related benefit costs. Therefore, despite flat sales and revenues and these increased costs, profit should be down only about 5 percent compared to 2002. Supplemental consolidating data We are providing supplemental consolidating data for the purpose of additional analysis. The data has been grouped as follows: Consolidated Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries. Machinery and Engines primarily our manufacturing, marketing and parts distribution operations, with Financial Products accounted for on the equity basis. Financial Products our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily Cat Financial and Cat Insurance. Consolidating Adjustments eliminations of transactions between Machinery and Engines and Financial Products. Because the nature of operations of Machinery and Engines and Financial Products is different, especially with regard to the impact on financial position and cash flow items, this data allows readers to better understand our company.

Page 42 SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 Certain statements contained in our Managements Discussion and Analysis are forward looking and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. The words "believes," "expects," "estimates," "anticipates," "will be" and similar words or expressions identify forward looking statements made on behalf of Caterpillar. Uncertainties include factors that affect international businesses, as well as matters specific to the company and the markets it serves. World Economic Factors Our current outlook calls for moderate growth in the U.S. economy in 2003. Our outlook assumes that the events of September 11, 2001 and the resulting impact on the economy were a one time event and that there will be no further events of this magnitude. If, however, there are other significant shocks or sequence of shocks, financial, economic or acts of war and or political terror, there could be a more protracted negative impact on consumer spending, housing starts, and capital spending which would negatively impact company results. U.S. GDP growth is expected to continue at moderate rates in 2003. Should recent interest rate reductions and fiscal stimulus measures fail to boost growth in the U.S. economy as expected, leading to renewed economic weakness, then sales of machines and engines may be lower than expected. The outlook also projects that economic growth will continue in Asia/Pacific, Africa & Middle East and the CIS. Growth is expected to improve in Europe, Japan and Latin America. If, for any reason, these projected growth rates or improvements do not occur, sales would likely be lower than anticipated in the affected region. Persistent weakness in the construction sector in Japan is leading to lower machine sales in the Japanese market. In general, renewed currency speculation, significant declines in the stock markets, further oil or energy price increases, political disruptions or higher interest rates could result in weaker than anticipated economic growth and worldwide sales of both machines and engines could be lower than expected as a result. Economic recovery could also be delayed or weakened by growing budget or current account deficits or inappropriate government policies. In particular, our outlook assumes that Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada maintain economic stimulus policies and that the Japanese government remains committed to stimulating their economic recovery with appropriate monetary and fiscal policies. The outlook also assumes that the Brazilian government follows through with promised fiscal and structural reforms; and that the Venezuela crisis is confined to Venezuela and does not spill over to negatively impact growth prospects in neighboring countries. If political instability continues to deteriorate leading to negative spillover effects, this could result in greater regional economic and financial uncertainty and weaker regional growth. Our outlook for 2003 also assumes that currency markets remain relatively stable, that average world oil prices fluctuate in a range of $22 to $29 a barrel, and equity markets recover. If commodity and or currency markets experience a significant increase in volatility, and or stock markets show further weakness, uncertainty would increase, both of which would result in slower economic growth, lower sales and potential impairment of investments. In addition, an eruption of political violence in the Middle East or a lengthy armed conflict with Iraq could lead to oil supply disruptions and persistent upward pressure on oil prices. In this case business and consumer confidence would fall and inflation pressures would move up leading to slower world economic growth and lower company sales. The Russian economy has improved, but political and economic uncertainty remains high and an unexpected deterioration could impact worldwide stock or currency markets, which in turn could weaken company sales. Commodity Prices The outlook for our sales also depends on commodity prices. Industrial metal prices recovered in 2002, and further gains are projected in 2003. But production rates are depressed and machine sales to the industrial metals industry are expected to be about flat. Oil prices remained flat near $25 in 2002. We are expecting oil prices to be about flat an average price of $22 to $29 a barrel in 2003. Based on this forecast, equipment sales into sectors that are sensitive to crude oil prices (oil, oil sands, coal and natural gas) are expected to be about flat. If, for whatever reason, average oil prices are significantly higher in 2003, our results would be negatively impacted. Extended weakness in world economic growth could lead to sharp declines in commodity prices and production and lower than expected sales to the industrial metals and agriculture sectors. Monetary and Fiscal Policies For most companies operating in a global economy, monetary and fiscal policies implemented in the U.S. and abroad could have a significant impact on economic growth, and, accordingly, demand for a product. In the United States, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates in 2002. These actions, together with projected federal tax cuts, and other fiscal stimulus measures are expected to lead to moderate U.S. growth in 2003, with some acceleration in momentum in the second half. In Europe, the European Central Bank reduced interest rates in 2002, further reductions are expected and growth in Europe is expected to improve in 2003. However, recent currency movements leading to a stronger euro may dampen European growth prospects in 2003 and this would cause machine sales to be lower than expected. Page 43 In general, higher than expected interest rates, reductions in government spending, higher taxes, significant currency devaluations, and uncertainty over key policies are some factors likely to lead to slower economic growth and lower industry demand. The current outlook is for moderate U.S. growth in 2003 near 3%. This is expected to lead to about flat industry sales levels. If, for whatever reason, there was a setback leading to weak or negative growth in 2003, then demand for company products could fall in the U.S. and Canada and would also be lower throughout the rest of the world. Political Factors Political factors in the U.S. and abroad have a major impact on global companies. In 2001, the U.S. Congress enacted a tax cut with the first reductions effective in the third and fourth quarters of 2001 and with additional benefits in 2002, which is having and should continue to have a positive impact on the U.S. economy. The company is one of the largest U.S. exporters as a percentage of sales. International trade and fiscal policies implemented in the U.S. this year could impact the companys ability to expand its business abroad. U.S. foreign relations with certain countries and any related restrictions imposed could also have a significant impact on foreign sales. There are a number of significant political developments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa/Middle East which are expected to take place in 2003 that could affect U.S. trade policies and or de stabilize local market conditions leading to lower company sales. In particular, a recent escalation of political uncertainty in Venezuela and the Middle East is contributing to a decline in business confidence and reduced capital investment intentions. In addition, significant political and economic instability persists in Argentina, Venezuela, the Middle East and Indonesia. Our outlook assumes that the effects of instability in Venezuela will be confined to Venezuela and not spread to other countries in the region. Our outlook also assumes that stability will ultimately be restored in Argentina, Indonesia and Venezuela through democratic means. If, however, the instability persists, worsens or spreads to other countries in the region, it could materially impact company sales into Argentina, Indonesia, Venezuela and other countries in the region. In addition, our outlook assumes that the recent escalation of the conflict in the Middle East does not deteriorate further into a significant armed conflict. In addition, we assume that recent terrorist incidents in Indonesia do not lead to a major, persistent escalation of political and economic uncertainty in that country. In recent months there has been a significant escalation in political tensions in North Korea. Caterpillar does not sell machine or engine products to North Korea and our outlook assumes there will not be a military conflict there. If, however, there is a significant escalation of political tensions in North Korea, leading to a significant military build up or increase in hostilities between North and South Korea, it could have a negative impact on sales to South Korea and other neighboring countries in the Asia/Pacific region. Our outlook also assumes that there will be no major, lengthy armed conflict in Iraq. If such a lengthy armed conflict does arise, it is Iikely business and consumer confidence will drop sharply, resulting in stagnant worldwide economic growth and declines in worldwide business demand. In this scenario, worldwide company sales would likely fall about 10 percent from 2002. Currency Fluctuations Currency fluctuations are also an unknown for global companies. The company has facilities in major sales areas throughout the world and significant costs and revenues in most major currencies. This diversification greatly reduces the overall impact of currency movements on results. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens suddenly against foreign currencies, the conversion of net non U.S. dollar proceeds to U.S. dollars would somewhat adversely impact the companys results. Since the companys largest manufacturing presence is in the U.S., any unexpected strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus key overseas currencies could have an unfavorable impact on our global competitiveness. Dealer Practices A majority of the companys sales are made through its independent dealer distribution network. Dealer practices, such as changes in inventory levels for both new and rental equipment, are not within the companys control (primarily because these practices depend upon the dealers assessment of anticipated sales and the appropriate level of inventory) and may have a significant positive or negative impact on our results. In particular, the outlook assumes that dealer inventories of new machines will be slightly lower at the end of 2003 than at the end of 2002. If dealers reduce inventory levels more than anticipated, company sales will be adversely impacted. Page 44 Other Factors The rate of infrastructure spending, housing starts, commercial construction and mining play a significant role in the companys results. Our products are an integral component of these activities and as these activities increase or decrease in the U.S. or abroad, demand for our products may be significantly impacted. In 1999, the six year Federal highway bill did not boost U.S. sales as much as anticipated due to delays in getting major capital projects for highways underway. In 2000/2001 there was an increase in the volume of highway construction contracts, which had a positive impact on sales of certain types of equipment. Highway construction contracts in 2002 were up slightly, and heavy construction machine sales were also up slightly. However, an appropriations bill approving federal funding for highways, streets, bridges, airports, etc. for fiscal 2002/03 (the final year of the TEA 21 legislation) has been delayed. The baseline outlook assumes that a new transportation appropriations bill is passed in early 2003 that maintains funding levels in 2003 near 2002 levels. If funding is reduced, sales could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if infrastructure spending plans are reduced by Federal and or state governments due to budget constraints, machine sales will likely be lower in 2003. Pursuant to a Consent Decree Caterpillar entered into with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the company was required to meet certain emission standards by October 2002. The Consent Decree provides for the possibility that diesel engine manufacturers may not be able to meet these standards exactly on that date, and allows companies to continue selling non compliant engines if they pay non conformance penalties (NCPs) on those engines. The company began shipping lower emission engines in October 2002 as a "bridge" until the fully compliant ACERT engines are introduced in 2003. These "bridge" engines require the payment of NCPs. Emissions standard changes negatively impacted our financial results in 2002, by $17 million after tax. We expect the net unfavorable impact in 2003 to be no more than the 2002 impact. We do not anticipate having to pay any NCPs on our medium duty engines in 2003 due to credits we banked in 2001 and 2002. Early in 2003, Caterpillar will begin ramping up production of medium duty and heavy duty compliant ACERT engines. We do not anticipate paying NCPs beyond 2003. If these assumptions are not realized, company performance could be negatively impacted. Projected cost savings or synergies from alliances with new partners could also be negatively impacted by a variety of factors. These factors could include, among other things, higher than expected wages, energy and or materials costs, and or higher than expected financing costs due to unforeseen changes in central bank interest rate policies. Cost savings could also be negatively impacted by unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any of the jurisdictions where the alliances conduct their operations. Results may be impacted positively or negatively by changes in the sales mix. Our outlook assumes a certain geographic mix of sales as well as a product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our results could be negatively impacted. The company operates in a highly competitive environment and our outlook depends on a forecast of the companys share of industry sales. An unexpected reduction in that share could result from pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, a failure to price the product competitively, or an unexpected buildup in competitors new machine or dealer owned rental fleets, leading to severe downward pressure on machine rental rates and or used equipment prices. The environment also remains very competitive from a pricing standpoint. Additional price discounting would result in lower than anticipated price realization. Inherent in the operation of the Financial Products Division is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer, and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customers management team, commodity prices, political events, and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Additionally, interest rate movements create a degree of risk to our operations by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed rate debt. While our policy is to use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes and lower the costs of borrowed funds, if interest rates move upward more sharply than anticipated, it could negatively impact our results. With respect to our insurance operations, changes in the equity and bond m arkets could cause an impairment of the value of our investment portfolio, thus requiring a negative adjustment to earnings. This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact our outlook. Obvious factors such as general economic conditions throughout the world do not warrant further discussion but are noted to further emphasize the myriad of contingencies that may cause the companys actual results to differ from those currently anticipated.
