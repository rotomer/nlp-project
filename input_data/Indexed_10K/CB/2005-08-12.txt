Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Investments Our principal investment objective is to ensure that funds will be available to meet our primary insurance and reinsurance obligations. Within this broad liquidity constraint, the investment portfolios structure seeks to maximize return subject to specifically approved guidelines of overall asset classes, credit quality, liquidity and volatility of expected 15 Table of Contents returns. As such, our investment portfolio is invested primarily in investment grade fixed income securities as measured by the major rating agencies. The management of our investment portfolio is the responsibility of ACE Asset Management. ACE Asset Management operates principally to guide and direct our investment process. In this regard, ACE Asset Management: conducts formal asset allocation modeling for each of the ACE subsidiaries, providing formal recommendations for the portfolios structure; establishes recommended investment guidelines that are appropriate to the prescribed asset allocation targets; provides the analysis, evaluation, and selection of our external investment advisors; establishes and develops investment related analytics to enhance portfolio engineering and risk control; monitors and aggregates the correlated risk of the overall investment portfolio; and provides governance over the investment process for each of our operating companies to ensure consistency of approach and adherence to investment guidelines. For the portfolio, we determine allowable, targeted asset allocation and ranges for each of the operating segments. These asset allocation targets are derived from sophisticated asset and liability modeling that measures correlated histories of returns and volatility of returns. Allowable investment classes are further refined through analysis of our operating environment, including expected volatility of cash flows, overall capital position, regulatory and rating agency considerations. The Finance and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors approves asset allocation targets and reviews our investment policy to ensure that it is consistent with our overall goals, strategies and objectives. Overall investment guidelines are approved by the Finance and Investment Committee to ensure appropriate levels of portfolio liquidity, credit quality, diversification and volatility are maintained. In addition, the Finance and Investment Committee systematically reviews the portfolios exposures to capture any potential violations of investment guidelines. Within the guidelines and asset allocation parameters established by the Finance and Investment Committee, individual investment committees of the operating segments determine tactical asset allocation. Additionally, these committees review all investment related activity that affects their operating company, including the selection of outside investment advisors, proposed asset allocations changes, and the systematic review of investment guidelines. For additional information regarding the investment portfolio, including breakdowns of the sector and maturity distributions, see Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Regulation Bermuda Operations In Bermuda, our insurance subsidiaries are principally regulated by the Insurance Act 1978 (as amended) and related regulations (the Act). The Act imposes on Bermuda insurance companies, solvency and liquidity standards, as well as auditing and reporting requirements, and grants the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the Authority) powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. Significant requirements include the appointment of an independent auditor, the appointment of a loss reserve specialist and the filing of the Annual Statutory Financial Return with the Supervisor of Insurance (the Supervisor). The Supervisor is the chief administrative officer under the Act. The Minister of Finance (the Minister) has appointed an Insurance Advisory Committee which provides advice to the Authority on matters connected with the discharge of its functions under the Act and also may advise the Minister on any matter relating to the development of the insurance industry in Bermuda. We must comply with provisions of the Companies Act 1981 regulating the payment of dividends and distributions. A Bermuda company may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (a) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (b) the realizable value of the companys assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. Further, an insurer may not declare or pay any dividends during any financial year if it would cause the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins, and an insurer which fails to meet its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year may not, without the approval of the Minister, declare or pay any dividends during the next financial year. In addition, some of ACEs Bermuda subsidiaries qualify as Class 4 insurers and may not in any financial year pay dividends which would exceed 25 percent of their total statutory capital and surplus, as shown on their statutory balance sheet in relation to the previous financial year, unless they file a solvency affidavit at least seven days in advance. 16 Table of Contents The Supervisor may appoint an inspector with extensive powers to investigate the affairs of an insurer if he believes that an investigation is required in the interest of the insurers policyholders or persons who may become policyholders. In order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to him, the Supervisor may direct an insurer to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with the insurers business. The Authority can obtain information from an insurer and from other persons registered under the Act either by requiring the insurer to provide it with such information as it requires with respect to such matters that are likely to be material to the performance of its functions under the Act or by requiring the insurer to provide it with copies of published or unpublished reports pertaining to the insurer and containing such information. The power to obtain information is exercisable in relation to any company in Bermuda which is a parent company, subsidiary company or other associated company of the insurer. The Authority is empowered to obtain documents from an insurer either by serving notice on the insurer to produce to it specified documents or by authorizing an officer, servant or agent to require an insurer to produce the documents to him. If it appears to the Supervisor that there is a risk of the insurer becoming insolvent, or that the insurer is in breach of the Act or any conditions of its registration under the Act, the Supervisor may direct the insurer not to take on any new insurance business, not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase the insurers liabilities, not to make certain investments, to realize certain investments, to maintain in, or transfer to the custody of a specified bank certain assets, not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions, or to restrict the making of such payments and or to limit its premium income. The Act requires every insurer to appoint a principal representative resident in Bermuda and to maintain a principal office in Bermuda. The principal representative must be knowledgeable in insurance and is responsible for arranging the maintenance and custody of the statutory accounting records and for filing the annual Statutory Financial Return. There are various obligations placed on the principal representative. Among other items, the principal representative must report to the Authority upon reaching the view that there is any likelihood of the insurer becoming insolvent or when the principal representative becomes aware or has reason to believe that the insurer has failed or defaulted in matters that may have been set out in the Act. The Act makes no attempt to restrict the nature of the risks underwritten by an insurer though conditions may be imposed relating to certain types of insurance business at the time of the application to register under the Act. U.S. Operations Although at the present time there is limited federal regulation of the insurance business in the U.S., our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish supervisory agencies with broad authority to regulate, among other things: licenses to transact business, soliciting business, advertising, rates for certain business, policy language, underwriting and claims practices, transactions with affiliates, reserve adequacy, dividends, investments and insurer solvency. In addition, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to judicial decisions that define the scope of an insurers duty to defend a claim and the risks and benefits for which insurance is sought and provided. These include judicial interpretations of the nature of the insured risk in such areas as product liability and environmental coverages. Regulations generally require insurance and reinsurance companies to furnish information to their domestic state insurance department concerning activities which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition and solvency of the company. Regulations vary from state to state but generally require that each primary insurance company obtain a license from the department of insurance of a state to conduct business in that state. A reinsurance company is not generally required to have an insurance license to reinsure a U.S. ceding company. However, for a U.S. ceding company to obtain financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded, the reinsurer must obtain an insurance license or accredited status from the cedants state of domicile or must post collateral to support the liabilities ceded. In addition, regulations for reinsurers vary somewhat from primary insurers in that reinsurers are typically not subject to regulator approval of insurance policy forms or the rates agreed to between ceding insurers and their reinsurers. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual and, in some states, quarterly reports with state insurance regulators in each of the states in which they do business. Such annual and quarterly reports are required to be prepared on a calendar year basis. In addition, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries operations and accounts are subject to examination at regular intervals by state regulators. The respective reports filed in accordance with applicable insurance regulations with respect to the most recent periodic examinations of the U.S. insurance subsidiaries contained no material adverse findings. 17 Table of Contents Statutory surplus is an important measure utilized by the regulators and rating agencies to assess our U.S. insurance subsidiaries ability to support business operations and provide dividend capacity. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval from regulatory authorities. These restrictions differ by state, but are generally based on calculations incorporating statutory surplus, statutory net income, and or investment income. State insurance statutes also impose Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements that are applicable to some of the U.S. insurance subsidiaries. These RBC requirements are designed to monitor capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholders. The RBC formula provides a mechanism for the calculation of an insurance companys Authorized Control Level (ACL) RBC amount. The initial RBC level which triggers regulatory action is known as the Company Action Level. Failure to achieve this level of RBC, which occurs if policyholders surplus falls below 200 percent of the ACL, requires the insurance company to submit a plan of corrective action to the relevant insurance commissioner. Based on the RBC formula, at December 31, 2004, the policyholders surplus of each of the active U.S. insurance subsidiaries was higher than the Company Action Level. There are additional progressive RBC failure levels, which trigger more stringent regulatory action. If an insurers policyholders surplus falls below the Mandatory Control Level (70 percent of the ACL), the relevant insurance commissioner is required to place the insurer under regulatory control. However, an insurance commissioner may allow a P&C company operating below the Mandatory Control Level that is writing no business and is running off its existing business to continue its run off. Brandywine is running off its liabilities consistent with the terms of an order issued by the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania. This includes periodic reporting obligations to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. The Commissioner has determined that Brandywine has sufficient assets to meet its obligations. In November 2002, the U.S. Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which requires commercial P&C insurers to offer coverage for losses due to certified acts of terrorism that does not differ materially from the terms, amounts and other coverage limitations offered by the insurer for other types of risks. Insured losses which are compensable under TRIA are those losses caused by an act certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, to be an act of terrorism. The Secretary may only certify an act as terrorism if it involves a foreign person or group and has resulted in damage within the United States or to a U.S. air carrier or U.S. flag vessel. To be certified, the act must have caused aggregate damages exceeding $5 million. TRIA nullifies all terrorism exclusions in existing commercial P&C policies, but such exclusions may be reinstated if the insured either gives written authorization for such reinstatement or fails to pay any increased premium for the terrorism coverage after 30 days notice. TRIA also provides for the federal government to reimburse insurers for 90 percent of their terrorism related losses, subject to a premium based deductible. The deductible for 2004 was ten percent of direct earned premiums for the year. For 2005, the deductible is 15 percent of direct earned premium. Unless renewed by the U.S. Congress, TRIA is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. Expiration of TRIA may lead ACE to reduce its writings to terror exposed risks or to take other measures to mitigate its exposure to the potential for catastrophic terror loss. Our U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to the general laws of the states in which they do business. The Attorneys General of several states have issued subpoenas or other forms of requests for information regarding the underwriting and agent compensation policies of several U.S. insurance subsidiaries. These investigations are primarily aimed at determining the compliance of these companies with the antitrust laws of the states which issued the subpoenas. International Operations The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which the non U.S. ACE operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example: in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports; some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer; the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurers use of foreign reinsurance vary; policy form filing and rate regulation also vary by country; the frequency of contact and periodic on site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country; and regulatory requirements relating to insurers dividend policies vary by country. 18 Table of Contents Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk based approach. ACE operates in some countries through our subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of those subsidiaries. Local capital requirements applicable to a subsidiary generally include its branches. Certain ACE companies are jointly owned with local companies to comply with legal requirements for local ownership. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, compulsory cessions of reinsurance, local retention of funds and records, and foreign exchange controls. ACEs international companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws. The complex regulatory environments in which ACE operates are subject to change and are regularly monitored. Europe AEGL and ACE Underwriting Agencies Limited (responsible for managing Syndicate 2488 at Lloyds) and staff employed within the U.K. operations, are subject to primary regulation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA U.K.). The FSA U.K. is the single U.K. statutory regulator for the supervision of securities, banking and insurance business. The FSA U.K. imposes capital adequacy, auditing, financial reporting and other requirements upon both insurers and the Society of Lloyds. In addition, Syndicate 2488 is subject to the requirements of the Council of Lloyds. The FSA U.K. regulates us and our subsidiaries in the ownership chain of our U.K. insurance companies, Lloyds managing agencies and Corporate Capital Vehicles (CCVs) pursuant to their authority with respect to a controller. Certain U.K. based directors and employees are individually subject to regulation by the FSA U.K. and Lloyds. AEGL was re authorized by the FSA U.K. to write all classes of general insurance business in December 2002. From January 1, 2003, AEGL has been underwriting business in the UK, and has established branches in 13 European Economic Area (EEA) states as well as Switzerland, a non EEA country. It is able to conduct cross border business throughout continental Europe on a freedom of services basis in 27 EEA states, including 10 new European member states added to the European Union on May 1, 2004. AEGL also has permissions to operate in Jersey, Guernsey and Gibraltar. AEGL is subject to group solvency requirements set by the European directive on Supervision of Insurance Undertakings in Insurance Groups. AEGL has been listed on the NAIC quarterly listing of alien E&S insurers since October 1, 2004, and now holds E&S eligibilities in 40 U.S. states. AEGL is also able to underwrite risks and issue reinsurance policies to insurance companies throughout most of the worlds markets on a non admitted basis. All ACE Europe branded P&C and A&H business was underwritten through ACE Insurance S.A. N.V. until December 31, 2004. On January 1, 2005, ACE Insurance S.A. N.V. transferred its assets, liabilities and obligations to AEGL, with regulatory responsibility transferring to FSA U.K. ACE Insurance S.A. N.V was registered as an insurer in Belgium and regulated by the CBFA (the Commission bancaire, financi&egrave;re et des assurances/Commissie voor het Bank , Financie en Assurantiewezen and formerly known as the OCA). With effect from January 1, 2005, ACE Insurance S.A. N.V. surrendered its insurance licenses and all ACE Europe branded business is now written through AEGL. The FSA U.K. has taken over the regulation of managing agents that were previously subject to Lloyds supervision. Lloyds Regulatory Department is now responsible for managing risk on behalf of the Lloyds Franchise and a new department, the Franchise Directorate, has been set up to approve and monitor each syndicates business plan. ACE Far East ACE Japan is regulated by the Financial Services Authority in Japan (FSA Japan). In accordance with the Insurance Business Law in Japan, the FSA Japan focuses on protecting policyholders interests by ensuring the sound management of insurance companies and their operations, including licensing, product filings and approval, distribution of insurance products, investment of insurance premiums and other assets, etc. FSA Japan staff conduct on site inspections when deemed necessary. Insurance companies must submit an annual business report regarding its operations and assets. Deregulation and liberalization of the Japanese non life insurance market has placed more emphasis on insurers independence of operation and compliance requirements. United States Regulation and Tax of Non U.S. Operations Regulation of non U.S insurers, often referred to as alien insurers, varies on a state by state basis. However, generally, alien insurers may write primary insurance in a state in one of three ways: (1) pursuant to a license issued by a state (admitted insurers), (2) by meeting a states E&S lines eligibility standards (surplus lines eligible insurers) or (3) pursuant to other 19 Table of Contents state specific exemptions. Alien insurers may write reinsurance on either an admitted or non admitted basis. Admitted alien insurers are subject to regulation of solvency, premium rates and policy forms similar to regulation of domestic insurers. Surplus lines eligible and other non admitted alien insurers may be subject to minimum solvency and security requirements and other state specific criteria. Lloyds is licensed for direct insurance in Illinois, Kentucky and the U.S. Virgin Islands and is an eligible E&S lines insurer in all states and territories except Kentucky and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Lloyds is also an accredited reinsurer in all states and territories. In certain states, various categories of direct insurance are exempt under state laws. Lloyds maintains various trust funds in the state of New York in support of past, current and future underwriting of U.S. business, subject to regulation by the New York Insurance Department, which acts as the domiciliary commissioner for Lloyds U.S. trust funds. There are also deposit trust funds in other states to support both reinsurance and E&S lines insurance business. In addition AEGL, is an eligible E&S lines insurer in 40 U.S. states, with a number of additional state applications pending. AEGL is also able to write reinsurance business on a non admitted basis in both the U.S. and a number of other jurisdictions. Each state in the U.S. licenses insurers and prohibits, with some exceptions, the sale of insurance by non admitted, non U.S. insurers within its jurisdictions. ACE and its non U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding its Lloyds operations, are not licensed to do business as admitted insurers in any jurisdiction in the U.S. Many states impose a premium tax (typically two percent to four percent of gross premiums written) on insureds who obtain insurance from non admitted foreign insurers, such as ACE Bermuda. The premiums charged by the non U.S. insurer do not include any U.S. state premium tax. Each insured is responsible for determining whether it is subject to any such tax and for paying such tax as may be due. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code) also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to U.S. risks. The rates of tax, unless reduced by an applicable U.S. tax treaty, are four percent for non life insurance premiums and one percent for life insurance and all reinsurance premiums. There can be no assurance that new or additional legislation in the U.S. will not be proposed and enacted that has the effect of subjecting our non U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including our Lloyds operations, to regulation in the U.S. Tax Matters Corporate Income Tax ACE Limited is a Cayman Islands corporation that operates as a holding company with offices only in Bermuda and does not pay U.S. corporate income taxes (except certain withholding taxes) on the basis that it is not engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. However, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not contend to the contrary. If ACE Limited were subject to U.S. income tax, there could be a material adverse effect on our shareholders equity and earnings. ACE Limited and its Bermuda based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries do not file U.S. income tax returns reporting income subject to U.S. income tax since they do not conduct business within the U.S. However, ACE Limited and its Bermuda based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have filed protective tax returns reporting no U.S. income to preserve their ability to deduct their ordinary and necessary business expenses should the IRS successfully challenge their contention that none of their income is subject to a net income tax in the U.S. Under current Cayman Islands law, ACE Limited is not required to pay any taxes on its income or capital gains. ACE Limited has received an undertaking that, in the event of any taxes being imposed, ACE Limited will be exempted from taxation in the Cayman Islands until the year 2013. Under current Bermuda law, ACE Limited and its Bermuda subsidiaries are not required to pay any taxes on its income or capital gains. ACE Limited and the Bermuda subsidiaries have received an undertaking from the Minister of Finance in Bermuda that, in the event of any taxes being imposed, ACE Limited will be exempt from taxation in Bermuda until March 2016. Income from the operations at Lloyds is subject to U.K. corporation taxes. Lloyds is also required to pay U.S. income tax on U.S. effectively connected income written by Lloyds syndicates. Lloyds has a closing agreement with the IRS whereby the amount of tax due on this business is calculated by Lloyds and remitted directly to the IRS. These amounts are then charged to the accounts of the Names/Corporate Members in proportion to their participation in the relevant 20 Table of Contents syndicates. Our Corporate Members are subject to this arrangement but, as U.K. domiciled companies, will receive U.K. corporation tax credits for any U.S. income tax incurred up to the amount of the equivalent U.K. corporation income tax charge on the U.S. income. ACE Prime Holdings and ACE Capital Re USA Holdings (through April 28, 2004) and their respective subsidiaries are subject, directly or, as shareholders, indirectly to U.S. corporate income tax and file U.S. tax returns. Certain of our international operations are also subject to income taxes imposed by the jurisdictions in which they operate. Related Person Insurance Income Each U.S. person, who beneficially owns our Ordinary Shares (directly or through foreign entities) on the last day of a non U.S. insurance subsidiarys fiscal year, will have to include in such persons gross income for U.S. income tax purposes a proportionate share (determined as described herein) of the related person insurance income (RPII) of such insurance subsidiary, unless the RPII of such insurance subsidiary, determined on a gross basis, is de minimis (i.e., less than 20 percent of that insurance subsidiarys gross insurance income in such fiscal year). RPII is income attributable to insurance policies where the direct or indirect insureds are U.S. shareholders, or are related to U.S. shareholders, of ACE, and is includible in a U.S. shareholders gross income for U.S. tax purposes regardless of whether or not such shareholder is an insured. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2004, we believe the de minimis exception will apply. Although no assurances can be given, we anticipate that gross RPII of each of our non U.S. insurance subsidiaries will fall within the de minimis exception and we will endeavor to take such steps as we determine to be reasonable to cause its gross RPII to remain below such level. The RPII provisions of the Code have never been interpreted by the courts. Regulations interpreting the RPII provisions of the Code exist only in proposed form, having been proposed on April 16, 1991. It is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes or clarifications might ultimately be made thereto or whether any such changes, as well as any interpretation or application of RPII by the IRS, the courts, or otherwise, might have retroactive effect. ITEM 2. Properties We operate in over 50 countries around the world including the U.S., Bermuda, the U.K., and Japan. Most of the office facilities that we occupy are leased. We are not dependent on our facilities to conduct business. ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims litigation involving disputed interpretations of policy coverages and, in some jurisdictions, direct actions by allegedly injured persons seeking damages from policyholders. These lawsuits, involving claims on policies issued by our subsidiaries which are typical to the insurance industry in general and in the normal course of business, are considered in our loss and loss expense reserves which are discussed in the P&C loss reserves discussion. In addition to claims litigation, we and our subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions in the normal course of business that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on insurance policies. This category of business litigation typically involves, inter alia, allegations of underwriting errors or misconduct, employment claims, regulatory activity or disputes arising from our business ventures. More information relating to legal proceedings is set forth in the section entitled, Insurance Industry Investigations and Related Matters, under Part II, Item 7. 21 Table of Contents ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders No matters were submitted to a vote of stockholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes presented on pages F 1 to F 78 of this Form 10 K/A. Overview ACE Limited (ACE) is the Bermuda based holding company of the ACE Group of Companies, incorporated with limited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Law. We created our business office in Bermuda in 1985 when we initially incorporated the Company and we continue to maintain our corporate headquarters in Bermuda. Through our various operating subsidiaries, we provide a broad range of insurance and reinsurance products to businesses and individuals worldwide through operations in the U.S. and more than 50 other countries. Our long term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income. By doing so, we provide value to our clients and shareholders through the utilization of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets. As an insurance and reinsurance company, we generate gross revenues from two principal sources, premiums which are usually paid in advance of loss payments, and dividends and interest income earned on invested assets. Cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses. Generally, when an insurance company writing long tail business grows, as ACE has over the last two years, its cash flows tend to be positive. ACE generated approximately $5 billion in positive operating cash flow in 2004 while invested assets over this period also increased by $4.9 billion. Invested assets are generally held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration. We also invest a small portion of our assets in less liquid or higher risk assets in an attempt to achieve higher risk adjusted returns. Claims payments in any short term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements. The value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility and credit events such as corporate defaults. The actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends, inflation rates, court awards and catastrophes. We believe that our cash balances, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet any unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead. The insurance industry is highly competitive with many companies offering similar coverage. Until recently, the insurance market had been characterized by sharply rising rates on new and renewal business, combined with restrictive terms and conditions. In 2004, we observed rate reductions across several classes and although we have continued to report growth in net premiums written, the rate of growth declined in 2004, compared with 2003 and 2002. This is a reflection of our underwriting discipline in the face of a weakening market, partially offset by our increased market and product presence both in the U.S. and throughout the world. We believe the market overall remains stable and rates, terms and conditions overall are reasonable despite the downward pressure on rates which has continued into the first quarter of 2005. 2004 was a record year for property catastrophe losses for the insurance industry. We incurred net losses of $499 million in 2004, primarily relating to hurricanes which struck the Caribbean and the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, typhoons which impacted Asia. The tsunami disaster had no material impact on our operating results and financial condition. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we increased our reserve for asbestos, environmental and other run off claims by $465 million, which resulted in an after tax charge to net income of $302 million. The net additions comprised asbestos and environmental (A&E) reserve increases of $554 million including the provision for bad debts of $95 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. For more information, refer to the section entitled Asbestos and Environmental and other Run off Liabilities. We are closely following developments on possible legislation to move all U.S. asbestos bodily injury claims to a federal trust for compensation in accordance with an established set of medical criteria and claim values. The trust would be funded by asbestos defendants and their insurers. As currently 26 Table of Contents proposed, ACE would be one of the insurer participants. However, we cannot predict if any such proposed legislation will be modified or adopted. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements Subpoenas, interrogatories and civil investigative demands ACE, its subsidiaries and affiliates have received numerous subpoenas, interrogatories, and civil investigative demands in connection with the ongoing investigations of insurance industry practices. These inquiries have been issued by a number of attorneys general, state and federal regulatory authorities, and state insurance departments, including the New York Attorney General, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. These inquiries seek information concerning underwriting practices with respect to non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products, often referred to as finite risk reinsurance. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with such inquiries. Independent investigation, internal review, and related findings The independent investigation of ACEs purchase and sale of finite risk contracts, which has been conducted concurrently by three outside law firms under the direction of the Audit Committee of ACEs Board of Directors, is essentially complete. Based on an assessment of contracts purchased, sold, and entered into among ACE subsidiaries and affiliates, more than 100 contracts identified as finite risk insurance or reinsurance were subject to review during the investigation. In addition, ACEs management reviewed these and other transactions as part of its own internal review of finite risk contracts. The independent investigation encompassed all business units of ACE, thousands of files, e mails and interviews with current and former employees of ACE. The Audit Committee and its independent investigation team believe that the scope and process of its internal review has been sufficient to determine whether finite risk contracts purchased or sold by ACE were improperly accounted for as insurance, rather than as deposits. As a result of the findings of the independent investigation and ACEs internal review, and in consultation with its independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC or independent auditors), ACE has concluded that the accounting for certain transactions was incorrect and the financial statements need to be restated. Restatement On July 18, 2005, ACEs Board of Directors approved managements recommendation to correct its accounting for eight contracts pursuant to the conclusions of the independent investigation and internal review. The eight contracts consist of three reinsurance contracts purchased by ACE or a predecessor organization, three contracts sold by ACE, and two intercompany transactions. Of these, management determined that seven did not meet applicable risk transfer requirements and should have been recorded as deposits. Each of these eight contracts originated prior to 2002. Some of these contracts involved written or oral agreements, understandings or discussions pertaining to risk expectations that were inappropriately not factored into the accounting treatment at the time of origination. In certain instances, agreements of this sort reduced or eliminated the anticipated risk transfer upon which the original accounting was based and resulted in the need for correction and the restatement of prior years financial statements. Only two of such contracts were in force at December 31, 2004. In addition to the eight contracts identified in the investigation, the Company has corrected the accounting for certain deferred compensation plans as well as certain unrelated, previously known errors, which were considered immaterial to require a restatement, but had been corrected in the periods identified. Pursuant to these corrections, the Company has restated its previously reported financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000, as well as each of the quarters in the years 2004 and 2003. Consequently, ACEs previously issued financial statements for these periods should no longer be relied upon. The restatement had no effect on the debt covenants. The aggregate net effect of these corrections is to increase 2004 net income by $14 million; increase 2003 net income by $65 million; increase 2002 net income by $23 million; decrease 2001 net income by $34 million; and decrease 2000 net income by $26 million. For further details on the effect of the restatement see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. All amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the restatement. 27 Table of Contents Insurance Industry Investigations and Related Matters On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General (NYAG) filed a civil suit against Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. (Marsh), alleging that certain Marsh business practices were fraudulent and violated antitrust and securities laws. ACE was not named as a defendant in the suit, although ACE was named as one of four insurance companies whose employees participated in the practices in question. There can be no assurance that ACE will not be named in future actions brought by the NYAG or any other state attorneys general. In addition, an underwriter who is no longer employed by ACE has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor based on these practices. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the attorneys general. ACE, its subsidiaries and affiliates have received numerous subpoenas, interrogatories, and civil investigative demands in connection with the pending investigations of insurance industry practices. These inquiries have been issued by a number of attorneys general, state departments of insurance, and state and federal regulatory authorities, including the NYAG, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. These inquiries seek information concerning underwriting practices and non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with such inquiries. ACE has been conducting its own investigation that encompassed the subjects raised by the NYAG, the other state attorneys general and the SEC. The investigation has been conducted by a team from the firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. The team is headed by former United States Attorney Mary Jo White and has operated under the direction of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has retained Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, special outside counsel, to advise it in connection with these matters. ACE has terminated three employees, one of whom has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and has suspended two other employees as a result of the internal investigation. ACEs internal investigations pertaining to underwriting practices and non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products are essentially complete. (See Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the investigation into non traditional or loss mitigation products). In January 2005, the Connecticut Attorney General (the CTAG) filed a civil suit against a subsidiary of ACE in Connecticut state court under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. The CTAGs suit alleges that an ACE subsidiary made an unauthorized and undisclosed payment to a broker who placed a portfolio of state workers compensation cases with ACE and seeks restitution to the state and payment of punitive damages. ACE believes that it has not violated any law or duty to the state and has filed a motion to dismiss the action. The State of Connecticut has not yet responded to the motion. ACE, ACE INA Holdings, Inc. and ACE USA have been named in the following federal putative nationwide class actions brought by insurance policyholders. Bayou Steel Corporation v. ACE INA Holdings, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 5391 E.D. Pa) (filed November 18, 2004); Eagle Creek, Inc. v. ACE INA Holdings, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 5255; E.D. Pa.)

(filed May 20, 2005) (Case removed from state court. Motion to remand is pending). In each of these cases, the plaintiff has sued a number of other insurance entities in addition to the ACE entities. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated these cases, as well as other putative class actions in which no ACE entity is named as a party in the District of New Jersey. 28 Table of Contents On August 1, 2005, Plaintiffs filed two consolidated amended complaints one concerning commercial insurance and the other concerning employee benefit plans. In the commercial insurance complaint, the plaintiffs named ACE Limited, ACE INA Holdings, Inc., ACE USA, Inc., ACE American Insurance Co., Illinois Union Insurance Co., and Indemnity Insurance Co. of North America. They allege that insurers, including certain ACE entities, and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of B quotes and contingent commissions. In addition, the complaints allege that the broker defendants received additional income by improperly placing their clients business with insurers through related wholesale entities that act as intermediaries between the broker and insurer. Plaintiffs also allege that broker defendants tied the purchase of primary insurance with the placement of such coverage with reinsurance carriers through the broker defendants reinsurance broker subsidiaries. In the commercial insurance consolidated complaint, plaintiffs assert the following causes of action against ACE: Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), federal antitrust law, state antitrust law, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. In the employee benefits complaint, the plaintiffs named ACE Limited, ACE USA, and Insurance Company of North America. They allege that insurers, including certain ACE entities, and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of B quotes and contingent commissions. In addition, the complaints allege that the broker defendants received additional income by improperly placing their clients business with insurers through related wholesale entities that act as intermediaries between the broker and insurer. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants improperly charged communication fees, which plaintiffs claim are also known as enrollment fees or service/administrative fees. Plaintiffs also allege that insurers transferred their insureds business, with who they had direct contracts with and no broker involvement, to insurance brokers in exchange for the insurance brokers steering additional business to the insurers. Plaintiffs also allege that broker defendants tied the purchase of primary insurance with the placement of such coverage with reinsurance carriers through the broker defendants reinsurance broker subsidiaries. In the employee benefits consolidated complaint, plaintiffs assert the following causes of action against ACE: Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), federal antitrust law, state antitrust law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. In both cases, the plaintiffs have sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. Illinois Union Insurance Company, an ACE subsidiary, has been named in a state court class action: Van Emden Management Corporation v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 05 0066A; Superior Court of Massachusetts) (filed January 13, 2005). The allegations are similar to the allegations in the federal class actions identified above. Plaintiffs assert causes of action under Massachusetts antitrust statute and Massachusetts consumer protection statute. Plaintiffs also assert a conspiracy cause of action and seek an injunction. Plaintiffs have sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE American Insurance Co., an ACE subsidiary, has been named in a state court lawsuit in Florida: Office Depot, Inc. v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. et al. (Case No. 502005CA004396; Circuit Court of the 15th Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach County Florida) (filed June 22, 2005). The allegations are similar to the allegations in the federal class actions identified above. Plaintiffs assert the following causes of action against ACE American Insurance Co.: conspiracy and concerted action to aid and abet Marshs breaches of fiduciary duties, conspiracy and concerted action to aid and abet Marshs fraud, antitrust violation under Florida law, deceptive and unfair trade practices, unjust enrichment, civil RICO under Florida law, commercial bribery, and punitive damages. Plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE has been named in the following four putative securities class action suits: John Mahaney, Jr. v. ACE Limited, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 07696; S.D.N.Y) (filed October 18, 2004); Steven Burda v. ACE Limited, et al.; (Case No. 04 CV 833; S.D.N.Y.) (filed October 21, 2004); Thomas E. Barton v. ACE Limited, et al.; (Case No. 04 CV 8683; S.D.N.Y.) (filed November 1, 2004); and Friends of Ariel Center for Policy Research v. ACE Limited, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 04907; E.D. Pa.) (filed October 19, 2004). Evan G. Greenberg, ACEs President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Duperreault, ACEs Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, and Philip V. Bancroft, ACEs Chief Financial Officer were also named as defendants in each of these suits. In addition, Dominic J. Frederico, ACEs former Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Christopher Z. Marshall, ACEs former Chief Financial Officer, were named as defendants in the Burda action. On January 3, 2005, the Burda and Barton actions were consolidated for all purposes into the Mahaney action. In December 2004, the defendants filed a motion with the JPML seeking consolidation of the cases for pretrial purposes in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The JPML granted that motion, consolidating the four cases in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The lead plaintiff has not been chosen in the consolidated proceeding. Nor has a consolidated complaint been filed. In the four complaints, 29 Table of Contents the plaintiffs assert claims solely under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), Rule 10b 5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (control person liability). The plaintiffs allege that ACEs public statements and securities filings should have revealed that insurers, including certain ACE entities and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of B quotes and contingent commissions and that ACEs revenue and earnings were inflated by premiums which it may have to forfeit by fines or judgments. ACE understands that it has been named as a defendant in a derivative suit filed in Delaware Chancery Court by shareholders of Marsh. The derivative suit seeks to recover damages for Marsh and its subsidiary, Marsh, Inc., against officers and directors of Marsh, American International Group Inc. (AIG), AIGs chief executive officer, and ACE. The suit alleges that the defendants damaged Marsh and Marsh, Inc. by participating in a bid rigging scheme and obtaining kickbacks in the form of contingent commissions. The suit alleges that ACE knowingly participated in the officers and directors breaches of fiduciary duty to Marsh, Inc. and Marsh. The plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE has not been served in this action, though no assurance can be given that it will not be served. ACE Limited and Evan Greenberg, as a former officer and director of AIG, have been named in In re American International Group, Inc. (AIG) Derivative Litigation, which is a shareholder derivative action brought by AIGs shareholders. The allegations against ACE concern the alleged bid rigging and contingent commission scheme as similarly alleged in the federal policyholder cases. Plaintiffs assert the following causes of action against ACE: breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties. All of these suits merely seek compensatory damages without specifying an amount. As a result, ACE cannot at this time estimate its potential costs related to these legal matters and accordingly no liability for compensatory damages has been established in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, in the year ended December 31, 2004, we have recorded expenses for legal fees of $11.5 million in connection with these matters. Additionally, as of June 30, 2005, ACE has paid and accrued over $44 million for legal related fees since the investigation began. In the opinion of ACEs management, ACEs ultimate liability for these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on ACEs consolidated financial condition, although it is possible that the effect could be material to ACEs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Catastrophe Exposure Management We have exposure to catastrophic event risks from global insurance and reinsurance writings of property and workers compensation and, to a lesser extent, marine, aviation and energy. This potential loss accumulation, caused by either man made (for example, terrorism, aviation) or natural perils (for example, hurricane, earthquake) is addressed using several different approaches. First, we have established a series of Product Boards to ensure that geographic, product and client exposures are appropriate and meet both account level and portfolio limit guidelines adopted by the Boards. Second, we have a standardized modeling approach across ACE that utilizes a third party probabilistic catastrophe simulation software package. Each unit with catastrophe exposure is required to model, price and manage its catastrophe risk using the software. The software allows the aggregation of risk within and across business units. In addition, we maintain minimum data quality standards that must be met in order to quote and bind business. The aggregation of risk across units, products, perils and geography is performed across ACE on a quarterly basis to provide an overall assessment of risk and the results reviewed by senior management each quarter. Management maintains a prudent level of risk through a series of related accumulation thresholds that cap the net retention from single or multiple events; the probability of exhaustion of core catastrophe reinsurance programs, and the net catastrophe loss relative to tangible capital. Third, where the risk / return economics are effective, reinsurance is purchased from reinsurers of appropriate quality and security to protect the business unit level from accumulations arising either within product, peril or business unit or across a combination thereof such that the aggregate risk from a catastrophe loss is appropriate to the units capital structure. Despite the above controls there remains uncertainty about the characteristics, timing and extent of insured loss given the nature of catastrophes. 30 Table of Contents Catastrophe Loss Charges During 2004, we incurred net catastrophe related losses of $499 million, primarily associated with hurricanes which struck the Caribbean and the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, typhoons which impacted Asia. We believe that the nature and amount of this loss was consistent with our exposure management guidelines discussed above. The following table shows the impact of the catastrophe loss charges on each of our operating segments for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The above information is based on currently available information derived from modeling techniques, industry assessments of exposure and claims information obtained from our clients and brokers. Actual losses from these events may vary materially from our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations resulting from several factors, including the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques, as well as the high frequency of recent catastrophes and the effects of any resultant demand surge on claims activity. Sale of Financial and Mortgage Guaranty Business through Assured Guaranty Ltd. On April 28, 2004, we completed the sale of 65.3 percent of our financial and mortgage guaranty reinsurance and insurance businesses (transferred business) through the initial public offering (IPO) of 49 million common shares of Assured Guaranty Ltd. (Assured Guaranty) at $18.00 per share. Assured Guaranty was incorporated in Bermuda in August 2003 for the sole purpose of becoming a holding company for our transferred business. Pursuant to the completion of the IPO, we received proceeds, net of related offering costs, of approximately $835 million and a return of capital of $200 million from Assured Guaranty, which were used to support our property and casualty (P&C) business and strengthen our balance sheet capital position. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we accrued $5.4 million related to the 338(h)(10) tax election entered into with Assured Guaranty as part of the IPO transaction (as discussed below). This amount, net of tax, reduced the previously disclosed loss on sale and is recorded in realized gains (losses). Inclusive of the fourth quarter gain, the transaction resulted in a pre tax loss of $1.3 million, that reduces net realized gains in the consolidated statement of operations, and an after tax loss of $14.6 million. Additionally, in the second quarter we recognized compensation expense of $7.5 million in connection with the settlement of ACE stock awards held by the employees of Assured Guaranty. These expenses are reflected in Other (income) expense within the consolidated statement of operations. In conjunction with the IPO, our tax basis in the stock of Assured Guaranty and the tax basis of certain of Assured Guarantys tangible and intangible assets were increased to fair value. The increased tax basis should result in additional 31 Table of Contents tax deductions available to Assured Guaranty over a period of approximately 15 years. To the extent Assured Guaranty generates taxable income sufficient to realize the additional tax deductions, our tax sharing agreement with Assured Guaranty provides that it will be required to pay us the amount of tax savings actually realized, excluding the effect of any loss carrybacks. We do not recognize for accounting purposes the benefit of the savings associated with Assured Guarantys asset step up until the amounts are accruable, based on actual taxable income of the relevant Assured Guaranty entities due to the uncertainty of realization. Subsequent to the IPO, we beneficially own 26 million common shares, or 34.7 percent of Assured Guarantys outstanding common shares and accordingly, no longer consolidate our interest in the Assured Guaranty companies. Beginning April 29, 2004, we account for the retained interest under the equity method of accounting with the carrying value of our investment reflected in Investments in partially owned insurance companies within the consolidated balance sheet and our proportionate share of earnings reflected in Other (income) expense within the consolidated statement of operations. For segment reporting purposes, our proportionate share of earnings is reflected in our Financial Services segment. In connection with the IPO, we have entered into reinsurance agreements with Assured Guaranty in order to retain the insurance liabilities of certain run off businesses, including trade credit and residual value insurance. At their inception, these contracts had no effect on our net income. Additionally, we have entered into a number of agreements with Assured Guaranty that will govern certain aspects of the relationship after this offering, including service agreements under which we will provide certain services to Assured Guaranty for a period of time. See Note 4 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information pertaining to this transaction. Critical Accounting Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. While we believe that the amounts included in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: unpaid losses and loss expense reserves, including asbestos reserves; reinsurance recoverable, including our bad debt provision; impairments to the carrying value of our investment portfolio; the valuation of deferred tax assets; the fair value of certain derivatives; the valuation of goodwill; and assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts. We believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses, Asbestos and Environmental Claims, Reinsurance, Investments, Net Realized Gains (Losses) and Other Income and Expense Items. Unpaid losses and loss expenses As an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required, under GAAP, to establish loss reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR), and include estimates of expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. At December 31 2004, the unpaid losses and loss expense reserve was $31.5 billion. We do not discount our loss reserves, except for net loss and loss expense reserves of $157 million representing structured settlements for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable. The process of establishing reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change. We have actuarial staff in each of our operating segments who analyze insurance reserves and regularly evaluate the levels of loss reserves, taking into consideration factors that may impact the ultimate loss reserves. The potential for variation in loss reserves is impacted by numerous factors, which we explain below. 32 Table of Contents We estimate loss reserves for all of the insurance and reinsurance business that we write. In most cases, we do not have all the necessary information to determine the ultimate settlement value for a claim at the time we are required to accrue for the loss. As a result, historical experience and other statistical information are used to estimate the ultimate cost of the loss, depending on the type of business. To determine carried reserves for a particular line of business, we may perform one or more reserving methods to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses and use the results to select a single point estimate. These methods may include, but are not necessarily limited to, extrapolations of our historical reported and paid loss data, application of industry loss development patterns to our reported or paid losses, expected loss ratios developed by management, or historical industry loss ratios. Underlying judgments and assumptions that may be incorporated into these actuarial methods include, but are not necessarily limited to, adjustments to historical data used in models to exclude aberrations in claims data such as catastrophes that are typically analyzed separately, application of tail factors used to project ultimate claims from historical loss experience when there are several data points to use, adjustments to actuarial models and related data for known business changes, such as changes in claims covered under insurance contracts, and the effect of recent or pending litigation on future claim settlements. The process of determining a single best estimate by product, when more than one estimate is developed in the course of the actuarial review, may be performed in several ways. However, the objective of such process, which is consistently applied to all product lines, is to determine a single best estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other. Such estimate is viewed to support the most likely outcome of ultimate loss settlements and is determined based on several factors, including but not limited to, the extent of historical data and reliance on such data within the underlying reserve methodology, historical accuracy of loss estimates compared with actual loss experience for the product line or comparable product lines, and nature and extent of underlying assumptions. Depending on the facts and circumstances of each product line, the determination of a single best estimate may be accomplished by selecting a single point estimate when one estimate is determined to reflect a better estimate than the other point estimates or using a probability weighted average approach when more than one estimate is viewed to be reasonable. For example, an actuary may select loss reserves developed using an incurred loss development approach instead of a paid loss development approach as the best estimate when reported losses are viewed to be more credible indicators of ultimate loss estimates compared with paid losses. The actuaries evaluation process to determine a best estimate involves collaboration with underwriting, claims and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. Each reserve committee includes the participation of the business units actuary, financial management and executive management and has the responsibility for finalizing and approving the point estimate to be used as our best estimate. Reserves are further reviewed by ACEs Chief Actuary and senior management. We do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates for our individual loss reserve studies. Actuarial ranges are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between loss reserves estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate settlement of losses. This is due to the fact that an actuarial range is developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas actual volatility or prior period development has historically been reported in subsequent Consolidated Financial Statements, in part from events and circumstances that were unknown as of the original valuation date. We do believe, however, that while our recorded reserves are reasonable and represent managements best estimate for each individual study, based on known events, our total recorded loss reserves at December 31, 2004, are unlikely to vary by more than ten percent of the recorded amounts, either positively or negatively, based on actual claims emergence over the last several years, excluding A&E development. Historically, including A&E reserve charges, our reserves have developed in excess of ten percent of recorded amounts. See the Analysis of Losses and Loss Expense Development for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements. While we perform annual loss reserve studies for all product lines, the timing of such studies vary throughout the year. Additionally, for each product line, we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations used in reserving each quarter. If warranted from findings in loss emergence tests, we will accelerate the timing of our product line reserve studies. The Unpaid losses and loss expenses section below includes a discussion of our reserve setting procedures by segment. The following is discussion of specific reserving considerations by type of claim: Short tail business, such as property coverages Short tail business describes lines of business for which losses are usually known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs. This would include, for example, most property, personal accident, aviation hull and automobile physical damage policies that are written. Typically, there is less variability in reserve estimates for these lines of business. 33 Table of Contents Long tail business, such as casualty coverages Long tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known for some period and losses take much longer to emerge. This includes most casualty lines such as general liability, directors and officers liability (D&O) and workers compensation. There are many factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long tail business. Among these are: Given the recent expansion of this business, historical experience is often too immature to place reliance upon for reserving purposes. Instead, particularly for newer lines of business, reserve methods are based on industry loss ratios or development patterns that reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development. For new or growing lines of business, actual loss experience is apt to differ from industry loss statistics that are based on averages as well as loss experience of previous underwriting years; The inherent uncertainty of the length of paid and reporting development patterns; The possibility of future litigation, legislative or judicial change that might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience relied upon in loss reserve analyses; Loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner. If data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics, such as loss payment patterns, the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected. Because casualty lines of business can have various intricacies in their underlying coverage, there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses. At December 31, 2004, approximately 74 percent, or $12.7 billion of our net reserves (68 percent excluding A&E reserves) relate to long tail business. The estimation of unpaid losses and loss expense reserves can also be affected by the layer at which a particular contract or set of contracts is written. In the case of direct insurance, where the insurer is taking on risk in the lower value end of the particular contract, the experience will tend to be more frequency driven. These lines of business allow for more traditional actuarial methods to be used in determining loss reserve levels, as it is customary to have more historical experience to rely upon. In the case of excess of loss contracts, the experience will tend to be more of a severity nature, as only a significant loss will enter the layer. For structured or unique contracts, most common to the financial solutions business and to a lesser extent our reinsurance business, traditional actuarial methods for setting loss reserves (such as loss development triangles), have to be tempered with an analysis of each contracts terms, original pricing information, subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts, market exposures and history, and qualitative input from claims managers. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves (A&E) Included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are liabilities for asbestos, environmental and latent injury damage claims and expenses (A&E). These claims are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards. The estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment, including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims. In January 2005, we announced net additions to our A&E and other run off reserves of $364 million exclusive of the provision for bad debts of $95 million. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $453 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. In addition, ACE Overseas General had gross and net A&E additions of $6 million resulting in a total A&E charge of $459 million for 2004. Our A&E reserves, and our range of estimates are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated changes in the legal, social or economic environment, or any benefit from future legislative reforms. Accordingly, our A&E reserves make no allowance for future state or federal asbestos reforms, such as those currently being contemplated. The majority of our reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2004 arose with the strengthening of a core group of major accounts impacted by changes in the asbestos industry landscape. In particular, our estimates of future liability were impacted by the continued negative effect of bankruptcies and an increase in defense costs to litigate cases. There are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome. We believe the most significant variables relating to our A&E reserves include assumptions regarding multiple recoveries by claimants against various defendants; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non products coverage; whether high level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholders claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants and the potential liability of peripheral defendants. Based on the policies, the facts, the law and a careful analysis of the impact that these risk factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs and coverage litigation expense. 34 Table of Contents The results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carrier, policyholder and claimants. Additional information on A&E can be found in the section entitled, Asbestos and Environmental Claims and other Run off Liabilities. Reinsurance recoverable Reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses, based on contracts in force, and are presented net of a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors. We determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts. The recognition of reinsurance recoverable requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves our estimation of the amount of gross IBNR to be ceded to reinsurers. Ceded IBNR is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (see Critical Accounting Estimate Unpaid losses and loss expenses). The second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we will ultimately be unable to recover from related reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a bad debt provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable balance and shareholders equity. Changes in the bad debt provision are reflected in net income. At December 31, 2004, the reinsurance recoverable balance includes $15 billion of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, less a provision for bad debts of $619 million. The net unpaid recoverables consist of ceded IBNR of $7.9 billion and ceded case reserves of $6.0 billion. Also included are $1.2 billion of reinsurance recoverable on paid loss and loss adjustment expenses, less a provision for bad debts of $309 million. Although the contractual obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectibility of such amounts requires significant estimation by management. The majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until sometime in the future (in some cases several decades from now). Over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us. To estimate the bad debt provision, the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer. This determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. As part of this process, ceded IBNR is allocated by reinsurance agreement, and then by reinsurer, because ceded IBNR is not generally calculated on an agreement by agreement basis. The allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements, as adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. If actual experience varies materially from historical experience, including that used to determine ceded premium, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will change. While such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the bad debt provision, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded. Generally, we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurers balance deemed uncollectible. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. The more significant considerations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: historical industry default statistics for the reinsurers current ratings class, the actual collection experience of the reinsurer, collateral triggers or other contractual provisions that may mitigate default exposure, and the dates the balances will likely become due (duration). For recoverable balances considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), management generally applies industry default factors consistent with the reinsurers particular rating class. Such factors have been developed by a major ratings agency; for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent, affiliate, peer company, or internal analysis, addi 35 Table of Contents tional judgment is required to determine a reasonable default factor. Such default factors are based on either an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate; and for insolvent insurers, management develops default factors based on an evaluation of each of the insolvent entities. At December 31, 2004, the use of different assumptions within the model could have a material effect on the bad debt provision reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our bad debt provision. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. Given the various considerations used to develop default factors, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the bad debt provision. However, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at December 31, 2004, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of all rated reinsurers could increase our bad debt provision by as much as 15 percent, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. While a rating downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for bad debt and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will not ultimately collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. Additional information on reinsurance recoverable can be found in the section entitled, Reinsurance. Investments Consistent with an available for sale designation, we report all investments in our portfolio at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in shareholders equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Fair value is determined using the quoted market price of these securities provided by either independent pricing services, or when such prices are not available, by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications. We regularly review our impaired investments (i.e., those debt securities in which fair value is below amortized cost or those equity securities in which fair value is below cost) for a possible other than temporary impairment. If we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, we record the decline as an unrealized loss in our shareholders equity. If we believe the decline is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a realized loss in our consolidated statement of operations. An impairment is considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment to recovery of fair value up to the cost of the investment, and evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period outweighs evidence to the contrary. The determination as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary principally requires the following critical judgments: i) the circumstances that require management to make a specific assessment as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary, such as the time period an investment has been in a loss position and the significance of the decline; and ii) for those securities to be assessed, whether we have the ability and intent to hold the security through an expected recovery period, absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse effect on either the financial markets or the financial position of the issuer. With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the securitys value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales could be made based on changes in liquidity needs (i.e., arising from a large insured loss such as a catastrophe), internal risk management considerations, the financial condition of the issuer or its industry, market conditions, and new investment opportunities. Day to day management of the majority of our investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers. While these investment managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss based upon new circumstances such as those related to the changes described above. We believe that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of our portfolio as available for sale. The gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2004, for all securities in a loss position was $72 million. Because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders equity, adverse changes in economic conditions subsequent to the balance sheet date could result in other than temporary impairments that are material to our financial condition and operating results. Such economic changes could arise from overall changes in the financial markets or specific changes to industries, companies, or foreign governments in which we maintain relatively large investment holdings. More information regarding our process for reviewing our portfolio for possible impairments can be found in the section entitled Net Realized Gains (Losses). 36 Table of Contents Our exposure to interest rate risk is concentrated in our fixed income portfolio. An increase in interest rates of 50 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve would have resulted in a decrease in the market value of the fixed income portfolio of approximately $400 million at December 31, 2004. An immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario. Deferred tax assets Many of our insurance businesses operate in income tax paying jurisdictions. We provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). Our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. At December 31, 2004, our net deferred tax asset was $1.2 billion, including $228 million relating to net operating loss carryforwards of $652 million, which will expire in the years 2021 2022 and foreign tax credits of $431 million of which $50 million will expire in the years 2011 2014. The remaining $381 million of foreign tax credits are currently deferred. (See Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Based on our current expectations of future taxable income we estimate that we will utilize all net operating loss carryforwards within the next one to two years. At each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction, principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies. Projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. If, in the future, our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax paying component proves to be incorrect, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. At December 31, 2004, the valuation allowance of $89.6 million (including $28.5 million with respect to foreign tax credits) reflects managements assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income or the inability to utilize foreign tax credits. Derivatives FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133) establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. FAS 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in our net income. We maintain investments in derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts primarily to manage duration and foreign currency exposure, enhance our portfolio yield or obtain an exposure to a particular financial market. In addition, as part of our investing activities, we purchase to be announced mortgage backed securities (TBAs), which we treat as derivatives for reporting purposes. Open derivatives as of the balance sheet date are reported at fair value based on market quotes or valuations provided to us by third party investment managers using market data. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used for investment purposes are reflected in net realized gains (losses). Certain products we sell have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. These products are accounted for at fair value and consist of GMIB reinsurance in our life operation and credit default swaps principally through our ownership interest in Assured Guaranty. We believe that the most meaningful presentation of these derivatives is to reflect cash inflows or revenue as net premiums earned, and to record estimates of future cash outflows as incurred losses. For both GMIB reinsurance and credit default swaps, when we determine that a future cash payment is probable, we establish reserves for the loss. Other components of fair value are reflected in other assets or other liabilities in the balance sheet and related changes reflected in net realized gains (losses) in the income statement. We generally hold these derivative contracts to maturity. Where we hold a derivative to maturity, the cumulative unrealized gains and losses will net to zero if we incur no credit losses on that contract. (See Note 2(o) of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information) The fair value of these instruments depends on a number of factors including changes in interest rates, changes in equity markets, changes in credit markets and for GMIB reinsurance, changes in the allocation of investments underlying annuitant account value. Where available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of these instruments. 37 Table of Contents If the quoted prices are not available, the fair value is estimated using valuation models for each type of instrument. These models may be developed by third parties, such as rating agencies, or internally based on market conventions for similar transactions, depending on the circumstances. These models and related assumptions are continuously reevaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely market information, such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities. Refer to Item 7A of the Form 10 K/A for a more detailed discussion of the sensitivity of our GMIB products to market factors. Valuation models include the use of management estimates and current market information. Management is also required to make assumptions on how the fair value of derivative instruments is affected by current market conditions. Management considers factors such as current prices charged for similar agreements, performance of underlying assets, and our ability to obtain reinsurance for our insured obligations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products, actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the differences may be material. Fair value adjustments attributed to derivative transactions are included in our net realized gains (losses). We recorded a loss of $13 million and a gain of $176 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, the change in fair value was related to many factors, including a loss of approximately $25 million related to the reversal of unrealized gains upon the termination of several credit default swaps and the sale of Assured Guaranty. The credit default swaps covered the equity layer of synthetic CDOs written by our financial solutions business. The unrealized losses were generally offset by increases in net premiums earned. In addition, net realized gains of $10 million were reported for GMIB reinsurance in 2004. In addition, in past years, we had entered into a few other, relatively illiquid, index based derivative instruments that were reported at fair value. These instruments were principally linked to equity and real estate market indices. The determination of fair value for these derivatives required considerable judgement as there was limited ability to trade the contracts, since they were uniquely structured and the exposure period covered up to 30 years. In early 2004, these contracts were terminated at a gain in conjunction with the sale of Assured Guaranty. Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the cost of our acquisitions over the tangible net assets we acquired, was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2004. The ACE INA acquisition comprises approximately 80 percent of this balance. FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, primarily addresses accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Pursuant to FAS 142, goodwill is not amortized to income but instead, is subject to a periodic evaluation of impairment. It is our policy to test goodwill as well as other intangible assets for other than temporary impairments on an annual basis. At January 1, 2002, the initial adoption date of FAS 142, January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2004, goodwill was assigned to the applicable reporting units of the acquired entities giving rise to goodwill. Our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing are primarily based on legal entities within our operating segments. The allocation of goodwill to these reporting units is consistent with goodwill recognized at acquisition. In effect, impairment tests are performed for each acquired entity giving rise to goodwill. The most significant reporting units are the domestic and international divisions of ACE INA, which were acquired in 1999; ACE Tempest Re acquired in 1996; and Tarquin Limited acquired in 1998. There are other reporting units that resulted from smaller acquisitions, that are also assessed annually. The transitional impairment test of goodwill determined that there was no impairment in goodwill in 2002. In our impairment tests, we principally use both an earnings model, that includes relevant financial data of comparable companies to the reporting unit being tested, such as the relationship of price to book value for recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies, and an estimation of fair value based on present value of estimated net cash flows. We must assess whether the current fair value of our operating units is at least equal to the fair value used in the determination of goodwill. In doing this, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our operating segments, as this is important in assessing whether an impairment has occurred. As part of our ongoing management assessments, we regularly analyze our operating companies in an effort to maximize future cash flows and profitability. For 2004, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $13 million primarily as a result of a review conducted during the first quarter which led to a write down of goodwill relating to our Lloyds life syndicate. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $6 million in 2003, due to updated forecasts which supported indications that two relatively small majority owned companies would not achieve sufficient contract sales volumes to generate and sustain future profitable results. If, in the future, our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities prove to be incorrect, goodwill carried on our balance sheet could be materially overstated. This would cause us to write down the carrying value of goodwill, resulting in a charge to earnings in the period recorded. Accordingly, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the charge is taken. 38 Table of Contents In 2002, we purchased approximately 22 percent of a Chinese insurance company, Huatai Insurance Company (Huatai). We account for our ownership interest in Huatai under the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2004, our carrying value for this investment is approximately $147 million, which includes goodwill of approximately $97 million. To date, Huatais product offerings have focused on P&C insurance; however, Huatai intends to commence selling life and asset accumulation products in 2005. Based on Huatais current business plan and the current state of the Chinese insurance market, we have determined that our investment in Huatai is not impaired at December 31, 2004. Risk transfer In the ordinary course of business, we both purchase, or cede, and sell, or assume, P&C reinsurance protection. For both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements as per FAS No. 113, Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts (FAS 113), must be met in order to obtain reinsurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premium and losses. If risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. We also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit. Contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment. Reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. For such contracts, often referred to as finite or structured products, we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception. To support risk transfer, the cash flow analyses must support the fact that a significant loss is reasonably possible, such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds 110 percent. For purposes of cash flow analyses, we generally use a risk free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments. In addition, to support insurance risk, we must prove the reinsurers risk of loss varies consistently with that of the reinsured and or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss. To ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed, quantitative risk transfer analyses and memos supporting risk transfer must be developed by underwriters for all structured products. Furthermore, throughout 2004, such assessments were reviewed and approved by Corporate Accounting. Beginning in December 2004, we formed a Structured Transaction Review Committee that has the responsibility of both reviewing risk transfer assessments and other relevant accounting matters for our structured products as well as certain underwriting criteria specific to structured or finite products. With respect to ceded reinsurance, we have entered into a few multi year excess of loss retrospectively rated contracts, principally in 2002, that provide coverage during 2004 and 2003. These contracts principally provide severity protection for specific product divisions. Because traditional one year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly, these contracts were generally entered into to secure a more cost effective reinsurance program. All of these contracts transferred risk and have been accounted for as reinsurance. In addition, we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to 2003, such as the National Indemnity Company (NICO) contracts referred to in the section entitled, Asbestos and Environmental Claims. In 2002, we commenced a policy to discontinue the purchase of all finite reinsurance contracts, at both the corporate and product division level. Subsequent to the acquisition of CIGNA P&C, we have not purchased any retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts. With respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts, products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer are primarily sold by our financial solutions businesses, included in our Financial Services segment. Such products principally include multi year retrospectively rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers. Because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products, relatively few P&C insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met. For certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits, the insured desired to self insure a risk but was required, legally or otherwise, to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non payment from the insured. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 The discussions that follow include tables, which show both our consolidated and segment operating results for the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In presenting our segment operating results, we have discussed our performance with reference to underwriting results, which is a non GAAP measure. We consider this measure, which may be defined differently by other companies, to be important in understanding our overall results of operations. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, life and annuity benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other (income) expense, interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. Underwriting results should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP.  Consolidated Operating Results (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Net premiums written $ 11,496 $ 10,268 $ 8,159 Net premiums earned 11,110 9,727 6,904 Net investment income 1,013 900 812 Net realized gains (loss) 197 265 (489 ) Total revenues $ 12,320 $ 10,892 $ 7,227 Losses and loss expenses 7,693 6,168 4,973 Life and annuity benefits 172 181 158 Policy acquisition costs 1,565 1,350 960 Administrative expenses 1,265 1,189 919 Interest expense 183 177 193 Other expense 3 34 36 Total expenses $ 10,881 $ 9,099 $ 7,239 Income (loss) before income tax 1,439 1,793 (12 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 286 311 (112 ) Net income $ 1,153 $ 1,482 $ 100 Net premiums written, which reflect the premiums we retain after purchasing reinsurance protection, increased 12 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. This increase was driven by P&C net premiums written growth of 22 percent, partially offset by a 69 percent decline in net premiums written in our Financial Services segment. Adjusting for the appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, net premiums written in our P&C business increased 18 percent in 2004. The increase in our P&C business was primarily a result of growth in property and casualty business due to broader market presence, and growth in personal accident business. In addition, our P&C retention ratio (the ratio of net premiums written to gross premiums written) increased to 71 percent in 2004, compared with 70 percent in 2003. Such increases were partially offset by a decline in net premiums written in our Financial Services business, primarily due to the de consolidation of Assured Guaranty beginning April 28, 2004 (subsequent to the IPO). Net premiums written increased 26 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, due to growth in P&C gross premiums written and increased retention. 40 Table of Contents The following table provides a consolidated breakdown of net premiums earned by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars)(Restated) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 3,397 31% $ 3,033 31% $ 2,187 32% Casualty 5,840 52% 4,503 46% 2,780 40% Personal Accident (A&H) 1,133 10% 920 10% 701 10% Total P&C 10,370 93% 8,456 87% 5,668 82% Global Re life 220 2% 184 2% 158 2% Financial Services 520 5% 1,087 11% 1,078 16% Net premiums earned $ 11,110 100% $ 9,727 100% $ 6,904 100% Net premiums earned reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure period expires. Net premiums earned in our P&C business increased 23 percent (21 percent, adjusting for foreign exchange) in 2004, respectively, compared with 2003. Our Financial Services business reported a decrease in net premiums earned of 52 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The change in net premiums earned for both the P&C and Financial Services businesses is consistent with the trend in net premiums written. Net premiums earned increased 41 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, consistent with the increase in net premiums written. Net investment income increased 12 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase in net investment income is primarily due to positive operating cash flows, which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base. The sale of Assured Guaranty during 2004 had the effect of reducing the average invested asset base for Financial Services, which resulted in lower net investment income for that segment. Net investment income increased 11 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, also due to the higher average invested asset base. In evaluating our P&C and Financial Services businesses we use the combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio. We calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. We do not calculate these ratios for the life reinsurance business as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that business. The combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting losses. The following table shows our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition ratio, administrative expense ratio and combined ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Loss and loss expense ratio 70.6% 64.6% 73.7% Policy acquisition cost ratio 14.2% 14.0% 14.0% Administrative expense ratio 11.6% 12.4% 13.5% Combined ratio 96.4% 91.0% 101.2% Our loss and loss expense ratio increased six percentage points in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses and A&E reserve strengthening, both recorded in the second half of the year. Partially offsetting the impact of these charges, we experienced less net adverse prior period development in 2004, compared with 2003. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, A&E reserve strengthening and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 70.6% 64.6% 73.7% Catastrophe losses 4.5% 1.2% 2.3% A&E reserve strengthening 4.2% 7.6% Adverse prior period development 1.0% 1.7% 3.1% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 60.9% 61.7% 60.7% 41 Table of Contents We recorded $499 million in catastrophe losses in 2004, compared with $112 million and $156 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a net increase in A&E and other run off reserves of $465 million. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $554 million including the provision for bad debts of $95 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. In 2002, net A&E reserves were increased by $516 million. Our loss and loss expense ratio is also impacted by prior period development. Prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years. For purposes of analysis and disclosure, management views prior period development to be changes in the nominal value of loss estimates from period to period and excludes changes in loss estimates that do not arise from the emergence of claims, such as those related to uncollectible reinsurance, interest, or foreign currency. Accordingly, specific items excluded from prior period development include the following: gains/losses related to foreign currency translation that affect both the valuation of unpaid losses and loss expenses and losses incurred; losses recognized from the early termination or commutation of reinsurance agreements that principally relate to the time value of money; changes in the value of reinsurance business assumed reflected in losses incurred but principally related to the time value of money and losses that arise from changes in estimates of earned premiums from prior accident years. We experienced net adverse prior period development excluding A&E of $82 million in 2004, compared with net adverse prior period development of $174 million and $211 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our Segment Operating Results, below, contain further detail of the prior period development recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our losses and loss expenses for 2004 also include $8 million in connection with the commutation of ceded reinsurance contracts that resulted from a differential between consideration received from reinsurers and the related reduction of reinsurance recoverables, principally related to the time value of money. Due to our initiatives to reduce reinsurance recoverable balances and thereby encourage such commutations, losses recognized in connection with the commutation of ceded reinsurance contracts in 2004 and thereafter are not considered when assessing segment performance and accordingly, are directly allocated to the Corporate segment. Additionally, we do not consider the development of loss reserves related to the September 11 tragedy (WTC) in assessing segment performance as these loss reserves are managed by Corporate. Accordingly, the effect of related loss reserve development either positively or negatively on net income is reported within the Corporate segment. During the fourth quarter of 2004, certain adjustments were made to these loss reserves; however, there was no net loss reserve development on a consolidated basis. Although the Corporate segment reported no net loss development, it incurred a tax benefit of $14 million from these adjustments since loss reserves developed adversely in taxable jurisdictions, thereby resulting in a tax benefit, but favorably in non taxable jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2004, gross and net unpaid losses related to WTC amounted to $756 million and $273 million, respectively. The remaining decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio for 2004 was primarily the result of favorable current accident year experience on property business of approximately $140 million. Partially offsetting this decrease were changes in business mix in our Global Reinsurance and Insurance North American segments. Global Reinsurance has been growing its non catastrophe P&C lines while Insurance North American has been increasing its participation in casualty lines. See the section entitled Segment Operating Results for more information. Our policy acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting and other costs that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of premium. The policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2004 compared with 2003 and 2002. For 2004 and 2003, our policy acquisition costs include commission expenses related to Policy Service Agreements (PSAs) of $53 million and $61 million, respectively. Our administrative expense ratios have declined over the last three years due to the favorable impact of expense reduction initiatives which commenced in 2003 and continued into 2004. Administrative expenses in 2004 were negatively impacted by costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act and by legal expenses incurred in connection with the AG investigations. Interest expense increased slightly in 2004 due to our issuance of $500 million of ACE INA 5.875 percent senior notes during the second quarter, partially offset by our repayment of the $400 million of ACE INA 8.2 percent notes in the third quarter. Interest expense declined in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to a reduction in average outstanding trust preferred securities. Other (income) expense includes equity in net income of subsidiary from Assured Guaranty see the section entitled Other Income and Expense for more information. Our effective tax rate on net income was 20 percent in 2004, compared with 16 percent in 2003. This is primarily a result of incurring the majority of the 2004 catastrophe charges in lower tax jurisdictions, causing our net income to decline without a commensurate decrease in income tax expense. Additionally, in 2004, we incurred approximately $13 42 Table of Contents million in income tax expense related to federal income taxes from the transfer of our U.S. financial and mortgage guaranty operations to Assured Guaranty and attributed to the sale of our Assured Guaranty shares. The A&E reserve strengthening resulted in tax benefits of $163 million in 2004, which partially reduced our overall effective tax rate on net income. Our effective tax rate is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates; a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective tax rate. The income tax benefit in 2002, relates primarily to the A&E reserve strengthening in that year. Net income declined 22 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses and A&E reserve strengthening. The appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar added $43 million to our net income in 2004. Net income increased significantly in 2003, compared with 2002, which was negatively impacted by A&E reserve strengthening. Segment Operating Results Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 Insurance North American The Insurance North American segment comprises our P&C insurance operations in the U.S., Bermuda and Canada. This segment writes a variety of insurance products including property, casualty (general liability, workers compensation, risk management, professional lines (directors and officers (D&O) and errors and omissions coverages (E&O)), marine, program business, aerospace, consumer oriented products, specialty lines and accident and health (A&H) principally being personal accident. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, Segment Information, under Item 1. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Net premiums written $ 5,101 $ 4,050 $ 2,921 Net premiums earned 4,679 3,689 2,477 Losses and loss expenses 3,898 2,541 2,222 Policy acquisition costs 447 380 216 Administrative expenses 451 402 342 Underwriting income (loss) $ (117 ) $ 366 $ (303 ) Net investment income 469 415 409 Net realized gains (losses) 126 53 (199 ) Interest expense 21 21 22 Other (income) expense 5 14 (1 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 82 194 (51 ) Net income (loss) $ 370 $ 605 $ (63 ) Loss and loss expense ratio 83.3% 68.9% 89.7% Policy acquisition cost ratio 9.6% 10.3% 8.7% Administrative expense ratio 9.6% 10.9% 13.8% Combined ratio 102.5% 90.1% 112.2% Net premiums written for the Insurance North American segment increased 26 percent in 2004 compared with 2003. The increase relates primarily to growth in casualty business, which increased 32 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. We have been increasing our participation in the casualty market in order to take advantage of more favorable market conditions (relative to property lines). In recent quarters, we have noted that although rates, terms and conditions continue to produce adequate returns, the growth in casualty premiums has begun to slow due to increased competitive conditions. Despite the softening market conditions, we reported robust growth on the strength of broader market presence, increased product offerings and higher submission flows. In addition, we have been increasing our retention of business due to the improving risk profile of our underlying business and our increasing capital base. Insurance North Americans retention ratio increased to 63 percent in 2004, compared with 59 percent in 2003, resulting in additional net premiums written of $307 million. Net premiums written for Insurance North American increased 39 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to increased retention of gross premiums written. 43 Table of Contents The following two tables provide a line of business and entity/divisional breakdown of Insurance North Americans net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars)(Restated) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 1,279 27% $ 1,102 29% $ 947 38% Casualty 3,226 69% 2,446 67% 1,445 59% Personal Accident (A&H) 174 4% 141 4% 85 3% Net premiums earned $ 4,679 100% $ 3,689 100% $ 2,477 100% (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) ACE USA $ 3,011 $ 2,216 $ 1,399 ACE Westchester Specialty 1,242 1,061 819 ACE Bermuda 426 412 259 Net premiums earned $ 4,679 $ 3,689 $ 2,477 ACE USA, which includes ACE operations in Canada, provides a broad array of products and services to corporate and consumer clients throughout the U.S. and Canada, primarily through licensed insurance companies. Distribution channels include retail brokers, agents, managing general agents, and managing general underwriters. ACE USAs net premiums earned increased 36 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to growth experienced in the casualty lines in 2003 and early 2004. ACE USA reported solid growth in risk management and excess workers compensation (primarily high deductible policies in national accounts business) due to new business, rate increases and higher retention. ACE USA also experienced strong demand for specialty products such as small business workers compensation coverage and umbrella, excess coverage as well as liability, professional liability (mainly D&O), environmental, commercial surety and medical coverages. The current years growth in net premiums earned has outpaced the growth of net premiums written, reflecting the launch of new products first offered in late 2003, expanded distribution and the more favorable rate environment experienced in 2003. ACE USA reported an increase in net premiums earned of 59 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to higher rates and increased volume of P&C business, especially on casualty lines. ACE Westchester Specialty specializes in the wholesale distribution of excess and surplus lines property, inland marine and casualty coverage and products. ACE Westchester Specialty also provides coverage for agriculture business and specialty programs through its Program division. ACE Westchester Specialtys net premiums earned increased 17 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. This increase primarily reflects higher casualty writings as well as increased agriculture coverage, reflecting growth in new business. ACE Westchester Specialtys net premiums earned for 2003 increased 30 percent, compared with 2002. This increase was primarily due to higher casualty writings and growth in agriculture business. ACE Bermuda, which specializes in providing professional lines and excess liability coverage, reported stable net premiums earned in 2004, compared with 2003, as increased capacity has fueled competition, and a decline in rates on professional lines and excess property business. ACE Bermuda reported an increase in net premiums earned of 57 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily on the strength of higher renewal rates and increased volume of new business across most of its product offerings. Insurance North Americans loss and loss expense ratio increased 14.4 percentage points in 2004, compared with 2003. This increase was primarily due to the A&E reserve strengthening, increased catastrophe losses and prior period development. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, A&E reserve strengthening and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 83.3% 68.9% 89.7% Catastrophe losses 2.7% 0.5% A&E reserve strengthening 9.8% 20.8% Adverse prior period development 4.2% 2.5% 3.2% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 66.6% 65.9% 65.7% 44 Table of Contents Our catastrophe losses for 2004 were $126 million, compared with catastrophe losses of $20 million in 2003. The 2004 loss and loss expense ratio was negatively impacted by the A&E and other run off reserve strengthening, which resulted in a before tax charge of $459 million, including the provision for bad debts, for Insurance North American. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $548 million including the provision for bad debts of $95 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. We also experienced $195 million of net adverse prior period development in 2004, representing 2.9 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net adverse prior period development of $103 million, representing 1.6 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 prior period development was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements, the most significant of which were: Adverse development of $98 million (accident years 2002 and prior) on the ACE Bermuda high excess professional lines business book due to updated information received for a few known claims with U.S. exposures. Adverse development of $298 million in our domestic U.S. run off operations following completion of reserve studies that reflected higher than anticipated actual loss experience. In particular; Workers compensation business (approximately $163 million across accident years 2001 and prior) on several blocks of business including middle market and excess policies, particularly related to a higher severity of claims relative to original expectations arising from various sources such as continued medical inflation and higher allocated claims expense costs. To respond to these trends, for certain workers compensation portfolios, a detailed claims audit was performed on a number of our larger blocks of worker compensation business and the latest actuarial studies segregated the claims data into finer components. The result of these efforts was a more detailed and refined analysis which included changes in loss development factors and tail factor selections, and led to the increases in our estimates of ultimate losses during 2004. General liability business (approximately $60 million across accident years 2002 and prior) on various books of business including primary and excess casualty. This development was principally the result of an increase in the frequency of claims reported relative to initial expectations. Open market facility writing specialty business ($28 million across accident years 1998 2002). Aviation business ($27 million in accident years 2003 and prior) primarily related to adverse case reserve development. Miscellaneous professional liability business ($20 million in accident years 2000 and prior). Favorable development of $181 million on lines with short tail exposures (i.e. property and marine) principally related to accident years 2003 and, to a lesser extent, 2002. Such favorable development was the result of lower claims emergence relative to prior years. The 2003 net adverse prior period development was related to casualty lines as adverse prior period development of $74 million was experienced in professional liability, reinsurance of long term disability and run off business and $46 million arising from an increase in medical inflation on run off workers compensation affecting accident years 1997 2000. This adverse prior period development was partially offset by $28 million of favorable prior period development on property, excess liability and marine lines of business. Net adverse prior period development of $85 million was incurred in 2002, primarily from run off business with the remainder being attributed to several lines of business including workers compensation, commercial automobile, health care asset management run off, warranty and financial institutions business. The remaining increase in the loss and loss expense ratio in the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, was principally the result of casualty lines comprising a higher proportion of net premiums earned. Due to their longer claim pay out duration, casualty lines exhibit a higher loss and loss expense ratio relative to other types of business. The impact of the increasing proportion of casualty business on the loss ratio was partially offset by favorable current accident year experience of $35 million on property business. Administrative expenses increased in 2004 and 2003, primarily due to increased staffing costs (primarily underwriting and support unit personnel) and technology spending, related to servicing the growth in Insurance North Americans product lines. The administrative expense ratio declined in 2004 and 2003, due to an increase in net premiums earned that outpaced the growth in expenses. The policy acquisition ratio for 2003 increased due to our decision to increase our retention ratio by purchasing less reinsurance, which resulted in reduced ceding commissions for Insurance North American. 45 Table of Contents Insurance Overseas General The Insurance Overseas General segment comprises ACE International, our network of indigenous insurance operations, and the insurance operations of ACE Global Markets, our excess and suplus lines writer (which underwrites P&C insurance through Lloyds Syndicate 2488 and ACE European Group Limited (formerly known as ACE INA UK Limited)). The Insurance Overseas General segment writes a variety of insurance products including property, casualty consisting of general liability, professional lines (D&O and E&O), marine, energy, aviation, political risk, consumer oriented products and A&H principally being personal accident. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, Segment Information, under Item 1.

Additionally, the retention ratio for Insurance Overseas General increased to 74 percent in 2004, compared with 73 percent in 2003. This increase in retention added $65 million to net premiums written in 2004. Net premiums written increased 32 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, due to rate increases, new business and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. ACE Internationals P&C operations are organized geographically and along product lines. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage as well as energy industry related coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial general liability and liability coverage for multinational organizations. Through our professional lines, we provide D&O and professional indemnity coverages for medium to large clients. The A&H insurance operations provide principally accident coverage to individuals and groups outside of U.S. insurance markets. In 2004, ACE International recorded an increase in net premiums written of 22 percent (11 percent adjusting for foreign exchange) to $3.2 billion. ACE Internationals increase in net premiums written was primarily driven by ACE Europe and ACE Asia Pacific, as both regions reported strong growth in P&C and A&H lines, mainly due to new business recorded in the first three quarters of the year. More recently, we have seen increased competitive conditions in Europe and the U.K. which have resulted in rates being flat or lower for ACE Europes P&C and A&H lines. ACE Latin America reported growth in A&H business. ACE Internationals net premiums written increased 38 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, due to rate increases, new business and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. ACE Global Markets main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, political risk and A&H. ACE Global Markets net premiums written increased three percent to $1.1 billion in 2004 (unchanged, adjusting for foreign exchange). ACE Global Markets net premiums written increased 40 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to rate increases, increased retention of gross premiums written and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. 46 Table of Contents The following two tables provide a line of business and entity/divisional breakdown of Insurance Overseas Generals net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) (Restated) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 1,416 33% $ 1,224 33% $ 758 30% Casualty 1,928 45% 1,659 46% 1,140 45% Personal Accident (A&H) 958 22% 779 21% 616 25% Net premiums earned $ 4,302 100% $ 3,662 100% $ 2,514 100% (in millions of U.S. dollars) (Restated) 2004 2003 2002 ACE Europe $ 1,934 $ 1,466 $ 925 ACE Asia Pacific 491 390 246 ACE Far East 382 367 335 ACE Latin America 355 297 225 ACE International 3,162 2,520 1,731 ACE Global Markets 1,140 1,142 783 Net premiums earned $ 4,302 $ 3,662 $ 2,514 Insurance Overseas General increased net premiums earned 17 percent in 2004, compared with 2003 (13 percent adjusting for foreign exchange). Consistent with the trend in net premiums written, the major driver of growth was ACE Europe which contributed close to 73 percent of Insurance Overseas Generals increase in net premiums earned in 2004. ACE Europe has been experiencing several quarters of increased production across most of its product offerings and has also been bolstered by the appreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Net premiums earned increased 47 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, principally due to new business, higher rates and the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Insurance Overseas Generals loss and loss expense ratio decreased 3.2 percentage points in 2004, primarily due to favorable current accident year experience on property business, which amounted to $95 million. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 56.4% 59.6% 61.1% Catastrophe losses 1.2% 0.3% 2.7% Adverse prior period development 0.3% 1.5% 4.1% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 54.9% 57.8% 54.3% Catastrophe losses for 2004 were $53 million, compared with $10 million and $68 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. We experienced $17 million of net favorable prior period development in 2004 (including $6 million relating to A&E reserve strengthening), representing 0.2 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net adverse prior period development of $55 million, representing 2.3 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 prior period development was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements, the most significant of which were: Favorable development of $103 million on short tail property and fire lines (primarily accident year 2003 and to a lesser extent 2002) primarily due to the emergence of favorable loss experience, mostly at ACE Europe and ACE Asia Pacific. Adverse development of $42 million on aviation business as a result of a lengthening of development patterns used in loss reserving analysis driven by recent claims emergence. Adverse development of $28 million on casualty lines due to changes in actuarial reserving assumptions and in particular those to derive allocated loss adjustment expense reserves, following detailed actuarial review. Adverse development of $12 million on political risk due to adverse loss experience most notably on expropriation and repayment default claims in Argentina. 47 Table of Contents Adverse development of $10 million on A&H, primarily driven by continued poor experience on Norwegian occupational injury (primarily accident years 2001 2003). Adverse development of $10 million on run off retrocessional business following review of individual treaties. The 2003 net adverse prior period development was driven by $54 million of adverse prior period development on specialty lines, including marine and satellite and also $38 million on casualty lines related to the lengthening of development patterns. This adverse prior period development was partially offset by $47 million of favorable loss experience on short tail property and fire lines. Net adverse prior period development of $116 million was incurred in 2002, primarily related to casualty and D&O lines for ACE International and aerospace business for ACE Global Markets. The policy acquisition cost ratio for Insurance Overseas General was stable in 2004, compared with 2003. Insurance Overseas Generals administrative expenses increased 12 percent in 2004, primarily due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and increased staff costs at ACE Europe and ACE Asia Pacific. The administrative expense ratio for Insurance Overseas General improved due to the increase in net premiums earned coupled with a reduction in Lloyds charges within ACE Global Markets. In 2003, the policy acquisition ratio declined compared with 2002, primarily due to changes in business mix. Administrative expenses increased in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to the increased cost associated with supporting business growth across all regions of the world and the depreciation of the U.S dollar. Global Reinsurance The Global Reinsurance segment comprises the operations of the ACE Tempest Group ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, ACE Tempest Re USA, ACE Tempest Re Europe, and ACE Tempest Life Re (ACE Life Re). ACE Life Re is our Bermuda based life reinsurance operation and is addressed separately. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, Segment Information, under Item 1. Property and Casualty Reinsurance (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 Net premiums written $ 1,518 $ 1,229 $ 777 Net premiums earned 1,389 1,105 677 Losses and loss expenses 973 560 304 Policy acquisition costs 271 211 123 Administrative expenses 65 62 40 Underwriting income (loss) $ 80 $ 272 $ 210 Net investment income 126 87 82 Net realized gains (losses) 27 54 (43 ) Interest expense 1 Other (income) expense (1 ) (3 ) (1 ) Income tax expense 14 14 1 Net income $ 220 $ 402 $ 248 Loss and loss expense ratio 70.1% 50.6% 44.9% Policy acquisition cost ratio 19.5% 19.1% 18.1% Administrative expense ratio 4.6% 5.6% 5.9% Combined ratio 94.2% 75.3% 68.9% Global Reinsurances net premiums written increased 24 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to higher non catastrophe P&C production at ACE Tempest Re USA and ACE Tempest Re Europe, partially offset by a decrease in property catastrophe business at ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. In addition, Global Reinsurances retention ratio increased to 97 percent in 2004, compared with 93 percent in 2003. This increase in retention added $63 million to Global Reinsurances net premiums written. Net premiums written increased 58 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, driven by higher rates and increased P&C volume. 48 Table of Contents The following two tables provide a line of business and entity/divisional breakdown of Global Reinsurances net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) % of total 2003 (Restated) % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 374 27% $ 311 28% $ 149 22% Casualty 688 50% 399 36% 159 23% Property catastrophe 327 23% 395 36% 369 55% Net premiums earned $ 1,389 100% $ 1,105 100% $ 677 100% (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 ACE Tempest Re Europe $ 303 $ 259 $ 142 ACE Tempest Re USA 751 468 182 ACE Tempest Re Bermuda 335 378 353 Net premiums earned $ 1,389 $ 1,105 $ 677 Net premiums earned increased 26 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, and 63 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increases were primarily due to the growing proportion of non catastrophe P&C business relative to catastrophe business over the last three years. ACE Tempest Re USA, which focuses on writing property per risk and casualty reinsurance, reported a 60 percent increase in net premiums earned in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to increased casualty business written and higher renewal rates. ACE Tempest Re Europe, which writes most lines of P&C with an orientation towards specialty and short tail products, reported a 17 percent increase in net premiums earned in 2004. This increase was primarily due to the robust casualty market in 2003 and early 2004, which offset weakness in property catastrophe and aviation. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, which principally provides property catastrophe reinsurance globally to insurers of commercial and personal property, reported an 11 percent decrease in net premiums earned in 2004. A market wide decline in rates on property catastrophe business, combined with our underwriting discipline has resulted in downward pressure on premium production for ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. The loss and loss expense ratio increased 19.5 percentage points in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 70.1% 50.6% 44.9% Catastrophe losses 22.2% 7.4% 13.0% Favorable prior period development (4.4)% (2.5)% (3.0)% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 52.3% 45.7% 34.9% We recorded $309 million in catastrophe losses in 2004, compared with $82 million and $88 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. We experienced $61 million of net favorable prior period development in 2004, representing 6.6 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net favorable prior period development of $27 million, representing 5.2 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 favorable prior period development related primarily to property and other short tail lines and resulted from a difference between the actual experience and the expected claims emergence used to establish the reserves for accident years 2003 and 2002. The 2003 favorable prior period development related principally to the better than expected claims experience on property and short tail lines. Net favorable prior period development of $20 million was incurred in 2002, primarily due to lower than expected losses on property catastrophe business. 49 Table of Contents The remaining increase in the loss and loss expense ratio was primarily related to the shift in mix of business that has resulted from growth in non catastrophe P&C business at ACE Tempest Re USA and ACE Tempest Re Europe. Non catastrophe P&C business typically exhibits higher loss ratios than property catastrophe business (except in periods with high catastrophe losses). As Global Reinsurance increases non catastrophe P&C writing, we expect its loss and loss expense ratio to continue to increase in line with what would be expected from a traditional multi line reinsurer. Global Reinsurances policy acquisition cost ratio increased in 2004 and 2003, due to the higher proportion of business generated from ACE Tempest Re USA, relative to ACE Tempest Re Europe and ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. ACE Tempest Re USAs business is written more on a pro rata basis (versus excess of loss), which incurs higher acquisition costs due to the higher level of ceding commissions paid. Administrative expenses increased in 2004 and 2003, primarily due to higher staffing costs to support growth in business at ACE Tempest Re USA. The administrative expense ratio decreased in 2004 and 2003 due to increased net premiums earned. Life Reinsurance ACE Life Re principally provides reinsurance coverage to other life insurance companies, focusing on guarantees included in certain fixed and variable annuity products. The reinsurance transactions we enter into typically help clients (ceding companies) to manage mortality, morbidity, lapse and or capital market risks embedded in their books of business. We use sophisticated stochastic modeling techniques to price our reinsurance products based on robust actuarial and investment models which incorporate a number of factors. These factors include assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, demographics, persistency, investment returns, macroeconomic factors such as inflation and taxation and certain regulatory factors such as reserve and surplus requirements. Our reinsurance treaties are non proportional in nature, all of which incorporate some form of annual claim limit, and many of which include an aggregate claim limit as well as either an annual or aggregate claim deductible. We also use modeling software to monitor, measure, and manage the aggregate exposure which is bound by limits set by senior management. We assess the performance of our life reinsurance business based on life underwriting income which includes net investment income. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Net premiums written $ 220 $ 185 $ 159 Net premiums earned 220 184 158 Life and annuity benefits 172 181 158 Policy acquisition costs 22 16 16 Administrative expenses 4 3 6 Net investment income 33 33 27 Life underwriting income 55 17 5 Net realized gains (losses) 7 (21 ) (14 ) Net income (loss) $ 62 $ (4 ) $ (9 ) Life underwriting income improved in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to the increase in net premiums earned, combined with lower life and annuity benefits. Net premiums earned increased in 2004 primarily due to higher variable annuity production, while life and annuity benefits declined due to the increased proportion of premium volume from variable annuity products, which typically have lower expected benefit pay outs than other business. Net income increased, due to higher life underwriting income, combined with net realized gains which arose primarily due to movement in interest rates and the equity market in 2004 and the corresponding fair value adjustment on GMIBs, which amounted to a $10 million gain. Life underwriting income increased $12 million in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to higher investment income, combined with lower administrative expenses due to reduced staff levels. Financial Services The Financial Services segment consists of our financial solutions business and our proportionate share of Assured Guarantys earnings, which is 100 percent through April 28, 2004, and 34.7 percent thereafter. The financial solutions operations provide one off insurance and reinsurance solutions to clients with unique or complex risks, which are not adequately addressed in the traditional insurance market. Each financial solutions contract is structured to meet the needs of each client. Assured Guaranty provides credit enhancement products to the municipal finance, structured finance and mortgage markets. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, Segment Information, under Item 1. 50 Table of Contents Certain products (principally credit protection oriented) issued by the Financial Services segment have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. For more information see the section entitled Critical Accounting Estimates. From April 29, 2004, our proportionate share of Assured Guarantys earnings is reflected in Other (income) expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The equity in net income recorded from Assured Guaranty in 2004 was $46 million. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Net premiums written $ 316 $ 1,028 $ 1,447 Net premiums earned 520 1,087 1,078 Losses and loss expenses 388 884 912 Policy acquisition costs 23 61 72 Administrative expenses 39 84 57 Underwriting income (loss) $ 70 $ 58 $ 37 Net investment income 147 201 189 Net realized gains (losses) (17 ) 191 (117 ) Interest expense 5 6 10 Other (income) expense (25 ) (1 ) (2 ) Income tax expense 35 64 13 Net income $ 185 $ 381 $ 88 Loss and loss expense ratio 74.6% 81.3% 84.7% Policy acquisition cost ratio 4.3% 5.6% 6.7% Administrative expense ratio 7.5% 7.8% 5.2% Combined ratio 86.4% 94.7% 96.6% Financial Services reported a decrease in net premiums written of 69 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The decline was primarily a result of the sale of Assured Guaranty, which reduced net premiums written by $509 million. Additionally, the financial solutions operations reported LPT production of $27 million in 2004, compared with $274 million in 2003. With respect to the financial solutions business, premium volume can vary significantly from period to period and therefore premiums written in any one period are not indicative of premiums to be written in future periods. Financial Services net premiums written decreased 30 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to the termination of equity layer CDOs in connection with our sale of Assured Guaranty. The Financial Services segment reported an increase in underwriting income of 21 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase was mainly driven by a lower loss and loss expense ratio in our financial guaranty operations prior to the IPO of Assured Guaranty. This improvement in the loss and loss expense ratio was a result of the settlement of one off transactions in preparation for the IPO. Underwriting income increased 57 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to a lower loss and loss expense ratio. We experienced $29 million of net favorable prior period development in 2004, representing one percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net adverse prior period development of $43 million, representing 1.7 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 development was primarily related to $38 million of favorable prior period development in connection with the receipt of ceding company reports updating claims information on large high excess of loss assumed multi year contract and $14 million arising on a multi year claims made insurance policy for which it was determined that certain claims previously recognized in 2002 and 2003 would fall below policy attachment points. The favorable prior period development was partially offset by $20 million of adverse prior period development on several contracts following actuarial reviews that concluded with updated loss development patterns. The 2003 adverse prior period development arose principally on the structured finance line of business due to credit deterioration in collateralized debt obligations assumed through reinsurance treaties and, to a lesser extent, an increase in a case reserve on an auto residual value transaction. Net adverse prior period development of $30 million was incurred in 2002, primarily from the ACE Financial Solutions International book, which comprises large, unique transactions, including LPTs. 51 Table of Contents Net Investment Income Years Ended December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Insurance North American $ 469 $ 415 $ 409 Insurance Overseas General 224 166 113 Global Reinsurance P&C 126 87 82 Global Reinsurance Life 33 33 27 Financial Services 147 201 189 Corporate and Other 14 (2 ) (8 ) Net investment income $ 1,013 $ 900 $ 812 Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. Net investment income increased 13 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, and 11 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increased net investment income is due to the positive operating cash flows over the last three years which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base. An increase in U.S. interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulted in an increase in the investment portfolios average yield on fixed maturities to 4.1 percent at December 31, 2004. This compares with an average yield on fixed maturities of 4.0 percent and 4.4 percent at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The sale of Assured Guaranty during the year had the effect of reducing the average invested asset base for Financial Services which resulted in lower net investment income for that segment.  Net Realized Gains (Losses) Our investment strategy takes a long term view, and our investment portfolio is actively managed to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines, designed to minimize risk. Our investment portfolio is reported at fair value. The effect of market movements on our investment portfolio impact income (through net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when other than temporary impairments are recorded on invested assets or through the reporting of derivatives at fair value, including financial futures and options, interest rate swaps, GMIB reinsurance, and credit default swaps. Changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities, which result from the revaluation of securities held, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The following table presents our pre tax net realized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 Fixed maturities and short term investments $ 113 $ 100 $ (58 ) Equity securities 84 (41 ) (157 ) Other investments (21 ) (25 ) (12 ) Currency 1 21 3 Derivatives: Financial futures, options, spread locks and interest rate swaps 33 34 (188 ) Fair value adjustment on insurance derivatives (13 ) 176 (77 ) Subtotal derivatives 20 210 (265 ) Total net realized gains (losses) $ 197 $ 265 $ (489 ) Consistent with our investment objectives and the classification of our investment portfolio as available for sale, subject to guidelines as to asset classes, credit quality, and liquidity approved by our Finance Committee, our investment managers generally have the ability to sell fixed maturity, short term, or equity investments when they determine that an alternative security with comparable risks is likely to provide a higher investment return, considering the realized gain or loss on sale and differential in future investment income. Often, sales of individual securities occur when investment managers conclude there are changes in the credit quality of a particular security or, for other reasons, market value is 52 Table of Contents apt to deteriorate. Further, we may sell securities when we conclude it is prudent to reduce a concentration in a particular issuer or industry. Therefore, sales volume may increase in a volatile credit market in which credit spreads and thus the market value of fixed maturity investments are subject to significant changes in a short period of time. The interest rate environment will tend to have a limited effect on sales volume but extreme conditions could have an affect on the magnitude of realized gains or losses. For example, in a declining rate environment, the market value of securities increase, resulting in a greater likelihood of net realized gains and we would therefore tend to reduce the average duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio. An increasing rate environment would tend to have the opposite effect. The effect of a high level of realized losses or gains for a particular period will tend to be offset by increases or decreases in investment income, respectively, in subsequent periods. From a liquidity perspective, our greatest risk is that we could be forced to sell a large volume of securities at a loss (i.e., in a high interest rate environment) to meet operating needs and are thus unable to reinvest proceeds to recoup such losses with future investment income (see section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information). FAS 133 requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, and measure them at fair value. We record the gains and losses resulting from the fair value measurement of derivatives in net realized gains (losses). We participate in derivative instruments in two principal ways as follows: i) to offer protection to others as the seller or writer of the derivative, such as our reinsurance of guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIBs) that are treated as derivatives for accounting purposes and our credit derivatives; or ii) to mitigate our own risk, principally arising from our investment holdings. We do not consider either type of transaction to be speculative. In 2004, we recorded net realized gains of $20 million on all derivative transactions. This compares with net realized gains on all derivatives of $210 million in 2003 and net realized losses on all derivatives of $265 million in 2002. Estimated changes in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income. Refer to Item 7A. of this Form 10 K/A for an analysis of the impact on our net income of changes in interest rates and the Standard and Poors (S&P) index. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties. We generally plan to hold derivative financial instruments to maturity. Where we hold derivative financial instruments to maturity, these fair value adjustments would generally be expected to reverse resulting in no gain or loss over the entire term of the contract. However, in the event that we terminate a derivative contract prior to maturity, as a result of a decision to exit a line of business or for risk management purposes, the difference between the final settlement of cash inflows and outflows and financial statement accruals for premiums and losses will be reflected as premiums earned and losses incurred, respectively. Additionally, at termination, any unrealized gain or loss, previously classified as a realized gain or loss, will be reversed and classified as a realized loss or gain, respectively. With respect to our GMIB reinsurance and credit derivatives businesses (insurance derivatives), we record a portion of the change in fair value in unpaid loss and loss expenses and future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts, respectively, representing our best estimate of loss pay outs related to fees or premiums earned, and a portion in net realized gains (losses), representing other changes in fair value. For 2004, the fair value adjustment included in net realized gains (losses), was net realized losses of $13 million. This compares with net realized gains of $176 million and net realized losses of $77 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004, the change in fair value was related to many factors including a loss of approximately $25 million related to the reversal of unrealized gains upon the termination of several credit default swaps. These credit default swaps were covering the equity layer of synthetic CDOs written by our financial solutions business. The unrealized losses were generally offset by increases in net premiums earned. In addition, net realized gains of $10 million were reported for GMIB reinsurance in 2004. The changes in the fair value of GMIBs are determined using internal valuation models. Such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty. The valuation of these products is subject to fluctuations arising from, among other factors, changes in interest rates, changes in the equity markets, and changes in the allocation of the investments underlying annuitants account value. These models and the related assumptions are continually reviewed by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely information, such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities. A net realized gain of $33 million was recorded on financial futures and option contracts and interest rate swaps in 2004. This compares with net realized gains of $34 million in 2003, and net realized losses of $188 million in 2002. We recorded a net realized gain of $8 million on interest rate swaps in 2004, compared with a net realized loss of $6 million in 2003. The interest rate swaps are designed to reduce the negative impact of increases in interest rates on our fixed maturity portfolio. In 2004, we recorded a net realized gain of $29 million on our S&P equity index futures contracts, as the S&P 500 equity index increased nine percent during the year. We use foreign currency forward contracts to minimize 53 Table of Contents the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on certain non U.S. dollar holdings in our portfolio that are not specifically matching foreign currency liabilities. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges and we record all realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts as net realized gains (losses) in the period in which the currency values change. We regularly review our investment portfolio for possible impairment based on criteria including economic conditions, credit loss experience and issuer specific developments. If there is a decline in a securitys net realizable value, we must determine whether that decline is temporary or other than temporary. If we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, we record it as an unrealized loss in our shareholders equity. If we believe the decline is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a net realized loss in our statement of operations. The decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as other than temporary rather than temporary has no impact on our book value. Once a security is identified as having a potential other than temporary impairment, we determine whether or not cost will ultimately be recovered and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security until an expected recovery period, absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse financial effect on the issuer. Our net realized gains (losses) in 2004 included write downs of $18 million related to fixed maturity investments, $9 million related to equity securities and $12 million related to other investments, as a result of conditions which caused us to conclude the decline in fair value of the investment was other than temporary. This compares with write downs of $29 million related to fixed maturity investments, $63 million related to equity securities and $29 million related to other investments in 2003. For 2002, our net realized gains (losses) included write downs of $101 million related to fixed maturity investments, $153 million related to equity securities and $14 million related to other investments. The process of determining whether a decline in value is temporary or other than temporary requires considerable judgment and differs depending on whether or not the security is traded on a public market as well as by type of security. As a result of our periodic review process, we have determined that there currently is no need to sell any of these securities to fund anticipated payments. We review all of our fixed maturity securities, including securities on loan, and equity securities for potential impairment each quarter. See Note 5 (e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for criteria we consider in assessing potential impairment. Note 5 (f) also includes a table which summarizes all of our securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004.  Other Income and Expense Items Years Ended December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities $ (41 ) $ (6 ) $ (5 ) Minority interest expense 22 18 3 Goodwill impairment 13 6 Other 9 16 38 Other (income) expense $ 3 $ 34 $ 36 Other expense decreased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, which was primarily comprised of $45 million from Assured Guaranty. Minority interest expense increased due to higher profitability in our rent a captive operations. Goodwill impairments increased primarily as a result of a review conducted during the first quarter of 2004 which led to a write down of goodwill relating to our Lloyds life syndicate. Other for 2004 includes compensation expense in connection with the settlement of ACE stock awards held by the employees of Assured Guaranty. The other expense for 2003 related to charges for commutation of a reinsurance contract. In 2004 and thereafter, these charges are included in the Corporate segment. Included in other for 2002 was $25 million in debt prepayment expense on the ACE INA Subordinated Notes due in 2009. This cost was primarily attributable to a decline in interest rates since the note was originally issued. Investments Our principal investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations. Within this broad liquidity constraint, the purpose of our investment portfolios structure is to maximize total 54 Table of Contents return subject to specifically approved guidelines of overall asset classes, credit quality, and liquidity and volatility of expected returns. Our investment portfolio is invested primarily in fixed income securities with an average credit quality of AA, as rated by the independent investment rating service S&P. The portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional, investment managers. The average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of interest rate swaps, was 3.4 years at December 31, 2004, and 2003. Our other investments principally comprise direct investments, investments in investment funds, investments in limited partnerships and trading securities. The following table identifies our invested assets by type held at fair value and cost/amortized cost at December 31, 2004 and 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 (in millions of U.S. dollars) (Restated) Fair Value Cost/Amortized Cost Fair Value Cost/ Amortized Cost Fixed maturities available for sale $ 22,891 $ 22,422 $ 19,312 $ 18,647 Short term investments 2,163 2,163 2,237 2,237 25,054 24,585 21,549 20,884 Equity securities 1,265 1,061 562 411 Investments in partially owned insurance companies 796 755 277 269 Other investments 606 551 444 409 Total investments $ 27,721 $ 26,952 $ 22,832 $ 21,973 We also gain exposure to equity markets through the use of derivative instruments. The combined equity exposure through both our equity portfolio and derivative instruments was valued at $1.4 billion and $662 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in our equity exposure is due to our efforts to diversify our portfolio and additionally due to increased equity returns in 2004, compared with 2003. Investments in partially owned insurance companies includes our 34.7 percent equity interest in Assured Guaranty which was valued at $530 million at December 31, 2004 and our 22.1 percent joint venture in Huatai our carrying value for this investment is approximately $147 million. The increase of $4.9 billion in total investments is due to positive cash flows from operations as a result of strong premium volume over the last several years. The increase in total investments was partially offset by a decline in invested assets of $1.8 billion, due to the sale of Assured Guaranty. 55 Table of Contents The following tables show the market value of our fixed maturities, short term investments and securities on loan at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The first table lists elements according to type, and the second according to S&P credit rating.

At December 31, 2004, our fixed income investment portfolio included below investment grade and non rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately seven percent of our fixed income portfolio. At December 31, 2003, eight percent of our fixed income portfolio was made up of below investment grade and non rated securities. We define a security as being below investment grade if it has an S&P credit rating of BB or less. Our below investment grade and non rated portfolio includes approximately 750 issues, with the top 15 holdings making up approximately 12 percent of the $1.9 billion balance at December 31, 2004. The highest single exposure in this portfolio of securities is $18 million. Below investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. Risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below investment grade securities. Below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. Also, issuers of below investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions such as recession or increasing interest rates, than are investment grade issuers. We reduce the overall risk in the below investment grade portfolio, as in all investments, through careful credit analysis, strict investment policy guidelines, and diversification by issuer and or guarantor as well as by industry. Restricted Assets We are required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support our insurance and reinsurance operations. These requirements are generally promulgated in the statutory regulations of the individual jurisdictions. The assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities. We also utilize trust funds in certain large transactions where the trust funds are set up for the benefit of the ceding companies and generally take the place of Letter of Credit (LOC) requirements. We also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for LOCs and debt instruments. (See Notes 9 and 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) 56 Table of Contents The following table identifies the value of restricted assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Deposits with U.S. regulatory authorities $ 857 $ 908 Deposits with non U.S. regulatory authorities 1,866 1,303 Assets used for collateral or guarantees 894 1,141 Trust funds 1,950 1,707 $ 5,567 $ 5,059 Deposits with non U.S. regulatory authorities increased 43 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, due to higher asset balances in support of our Lloyds Syndicate 2488. All syndicate assets are restricted under Lloyds Trust Deeds. Assets used for collateral or guarantees decreased 22 percent, primarily due to the sale of Assured Guaranty, combined with decreased use of our secured credit facility. The impact of the sale of Assured Guaranty on the trust funds balance was offset by increased asset balances to support growth at ACE Tempest Re USA. Additionally, with respect to one reinsurance contract, premiums had been deposited in a trust, invested in fixed maturities, for which an ACE affiliate in Bermuda provided an interest rate guarantee. Based on these guarantees, ACE concluded that it had the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership for the trust. Consequently, pursuant to the restatement, ACE has consolidated these trust assets of approximately $171 million effective January 1, 2004, the date the Company adopted FIN 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses We establish reserves for the estimated unpaid ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements. These reserves take into account estimates both for claims that have been reported and for IBNR, and include estimates of expenses associated with processing and settling claims. The table below presents a rollforward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004. (in millions of U.S. dollars) (Restated) Gross Losses ReinsuranceRecoverable Net Losses Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 27,083 $ 12,409 $ 14,674 Losses and loss expenses incurred 11,759 4,066 7,693 Losses and loss expenses paid (7,838 ) (3,078 ) (4,760 ) Sale of Assured Guaranty (477 ) (103 ) (374 ) Other (including foreign exchange revaluation) 956 672 284 Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 31,483 $ 13,966 $ 17,517 The process of establishing reserves for claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. Our estimates and judgments may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed; as new or improved methodologies are developed; or as current laws change. We do not discount our loss reserves, except for net loss and loss expense reserves of $157 million representing structured settlements for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable. The following table shows our total reserves segregated between case reserves and IBNR reserves.

Specialty includes aviation, satellite, marine, A&H, political risk and personal lines of business. The following table shows these components at December 31, 2004.

We estimate the ultimate loss amounts by projecting losses as of the valuation date using loss development patterns derived from historical data. In addition, a tail factor is applied to the projected loss amount to reflect further potential development beyond the period of historical record. While we believe our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2004 is adequate, new information or trends, such as judicial action broadening the scope of coverage or expanding liability, may lead to future developments in ultimate losses and loss expenses significantly greater or less than the reserve provided, which could have a material adverse effect on future operating results. Particularly significant variables for which a change in assumption could have a material effect on unpaid losses and loss expenses include, but are not limited to, the following: Insurance North American Segment Given the long reporting and paid development pattern, the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for claims covered by our middle market workers compensation policies require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated losses and loss expense reserves. Specifically, a one percent change in the tail factor could cause approximately a $45 million change, either positively or negatively, for the selected net loss and loss expense ultimate for that segment. We believe that our selected tail factors represent the most likely loss development based on historical loss payment patterns of this and other comparable long tail lines of business as well as the current legal and economic environment. The actual tail factor could vary by several percentage points from the tail factor selected. Because tail factors are stated in terms of decimals (e.g., 1.125) and often, the actuarys choice regarding reasonably supportable tail factors range within percentages of each other, the realistic change in tail factors can be expressed in percentage points. Our ACE Bermuda operations write predominantly high excess of loss claims made professional liability business typically with attachment points in excess of $100 million. Claims development for this business can vary significantly for individual claims and historically could vary by as much as $50 million per claim depending on the nature of the loss. 58 Table of Contents Insurance Overseas General Certain international long tail lines, such as casualty and professional lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation. Heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world are increasing the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty of the reserving estimates. Our reserving methods rely heavily on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment, it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments. For example, a three month delay of our selected loss development patterns could increase reserve estimates on long tail casualty and professional lines by approximately $65 million. Global Reinsurance Typically there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reporting development patterns, especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers compensation or general liability, which may take up to 30 years to fully develop. This uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns as justified by the credibility of the data. The underlying source and selection of the final development pattern can thus have a significant impact on the selected net loss and loss expense ultimate. For example, a 10 percent slowing or quickening of the development pattern for certain long tail lines could cause the ultimate loss derived by the reported Bornhuetter Ferguson method to increase by as much as three percent, or $30 million. Assumed Reinsurance At December 31, 2004, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the Global Reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.5 billion, consisting of $400 million of case reserves and $1.1 billion of IBNR. Prior to 2000, our reinsurance operations had been concentrated in the property catastrophe reinsurance market. For catastrophe business, we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants, ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers, and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event. The latter internal analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves. In 2000, we began writing casualty lines of reinsurance in the United States, and to a lesser extent, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Given the long tail nature of this business, these new lines have both increased the amount of reserves in the Global Reinsurance segment as well as the uncertainty in the loss estimation process. For our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. Due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies, as well as other factors, the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: The reported claims information could be inaccurate. Typically, a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim. The use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag. Because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. The reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations. Therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines. The historical claims data for a particular reinsurance agreement can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available. Additionally, for many coverages, such as excess of loss contracts, there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability. In such cases, the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources. We mitigate the above risks in several ways. In addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable, we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate, complete, and timely. As appropriate, audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process. We also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses. On occasion, there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves recorded at ceding companies. This is due to the fact that we 59 Table of Contents only receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies with respect to case reserves. For IBNR, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss (see Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses for more information). We estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treatys coverage basis (i.e. risks attaching or losses occurring). At December 31, 2004, the case reserves reported to us by our ceding companies were $394 million, compared with the $408 million we recorded. We do, on occasion, post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant. Within the Insurance North American segment, we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run off since 1994. Unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run off reinsurance business resides within the Brandywine Division of our Insurance North American segment. Most of the remaining unpaid losses and loss expense reserves for the run off reinsurance business relate to asbestos and environmental claims. (See section entitled Asbestos and Environmental Claims for more information) Asbestos and Environmental and Other Run off Liabilities Included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for asbestos, environmental and latent injury damage claims and expenses (A&E). These A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily injury claims related to asbestos products and environmental hazards. The estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment, including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims. These liabilities include provision for both reported and IBNR claims. The table below presents a roll forward of our selected loss reserve data for A&E exposures, excluding the provision for bad debts, for the year ended December 31, 2004. Asbestos Environmental and Other Latent Exposures Total (in millions of U.S. dollars) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Balance at December 31, 2003* $ 3,168 $ 320 $ 1,205 $ 227 $ 4,373 $ 547 Losses and loss expenses incurred 1,073 430 38 29 1,111 459 Losses and loss expenses paid (357 ) (25 ) (188 ) (1 ) (545 ) (26 ) Foreign currency revaluation 13 4 13 4 Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 3,897 $ 729 $ 1,055 $ 255 $ 4,952 $ 984 * Includes reclassification of asbestos claims from other lines of business for comparative purposes. Our exposure to A&E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998 and the P&C business of CIGNA in 1999, with the larger exposure contained within the liabilities acquired in the CIGNA transaction. In 1996, prior to our acquisition of the P&C business of CIGNA, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner approved a plan to restructure INA Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Restructuring) which included the division of Insurance Company of North America (INA) into two separate corporations: (1) an active insurance company that retained the INA name and continued to write P&C business and (2) an inactive run off company, now called Century Indemnity Company (Century). As a result of the division, the A&E liabilities of INA were allocated to Century and extinguished, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, as liabilities of INA. As part of the Restructuring, the A&E liabilities of various U.S. affiliates of INA were reinsured to Century, and Century and certain other run off companies housing A&E liabilities were contributed to Brandywine Holdings Corporation (Brandywine Holdings). As part of the 1999 acquisition of the P&C business of CIGNA, we acquired Brandywine Holdings and its various subsidiaries. During the second half of 2004, we conducted an internal, ground up review of our consolidated A&E liabilities. During this same period, a team of external actuaries performed an evaluation as to the adequacy of the reserves of Century and its two U.S. insurance subsidiaries, ACE American Reinsurance Company (ACE American Re), and Century Reinsurance Company (Century Re), both Pennsylvania insurers. The external review was conducted in accordance with the Brandywine restructuring order, which requires that an external actuarial review of Centurys reserves be completed every two years. In January 2005, we announced net additions to our A&E and other run off reserves of $364 million exclusive of the provision for bad debts of $95 million. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $453 million and favorable 60 Table of Contents prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. In addition, ACE Overseas General had gross and net A&E additions of $6 million resulting in a total A&E charge of $459 million for 2004. Our A&E reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated changes in the legal, social or economic environment, or any benefit from future legislative reforms. Accordingly, our A&E reserves make no allowance for future state or federal asbestos reforms, such as those currently being contemplated. The majority of our reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2004 arose with the strengthening of a core group of major accounts impacted by changes in the asbestos industry landscape. In particular, our estimates of future liability were impacted by the continued negative effect of bankruptcies and an increase in defense costs to litigate cases. In 2004, the pre tax gross reserve increase related to the Brandywine operations was $788 million and $339 million net of reinsurance. The Brandywine reserve increase related not only to A&E exposures but also to other run off exposures included in the Brandywine operations. These other run off exposures increased pre tax gross reserves by $68 million while reducing net reserves by $89 million primarily due to favorable development in ceded IBNR in these other exposures. For Westchester Specialty, the A&E pre tax gross reserve increase was $385 million and $25 million net of reinsurance. In the January 2005 announcement the gross reserve increase in A&E was net of favorable gross reserve development in other run off exposures at Westchester Specialty of $180 million. ACE Overseas General also had an A&E pre tax reserve increase of $6 million gross and net of reinsurance. In 2003, there were no losses and loss expenses incurred for A&E. Paid losses for asbestos claims were $293 million on gross reserves and $169 million on net reserves. Environmental and other latent exposure claim payments were $204 million on gross reserves and $153 million on net reserves. For GAAP purposes, our A&E loss reserves are held at nominal value (i.e., they are not discounted despite the long term nature of liabilities). Reserving Considerations For asbestos, we face claims relating to policies issued covering product manufacturers, distributors, installers and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos. Claims can be filed by individual claimants or group of claimants with the potential for hundreds of individual claimants at one time. Claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies for a single insured. For asbestos, our internal definition of a count is a policyholder asbestos cause of action. For example, an asbestos manufacturer who faces products liability claims alleging bodily injury from exposure to their product would generate one count regardless of the number of policies we may have issued or the actual numbers of underlying claimants alleging damages. If however, the policyholder were to face claims arising under both an asbestos exposure and a combined silica and asbestos (mixed dust) exposure, each of these causative agents for that policyholder would generate a separate count. The table below summarizes count information for asbestos, environmental and long term exposure (LTE) claims for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, for direct policies only, and excludes claims from assumed reinsurance. 2004 2003 Asbestos (by causative agent) Open at the beginning of year 1,318 1,042 Newly reported 190 320 Closed or otherwise disposed 134 44 Open at end of year 1,374 1,318 Environmental (by site) Open at the beginning of year 8,588 9,145 Newly reported 549 720 Closed or otherwise disposed 1,965 1,277 Open at end of year 7,172 8,588 LTE (by causative agent) Open at the beginning of year 927 915 Newly reported 233 212 Closed or otherwise disposed 240 200 Open at end of year 920 927 61 Table of Contents The total pending counts for asbestos at December 31, 2004 are 1,374 as shown in the table above. In our January 6, 2005 disclosure on asbestos, we included a table that showed a total of 1,276 direct policyholders. The differences between the two numbers are as follows: The prior disclosure counted each policyholder only once regardless of whether there are multiple asbestos causes of action. The first category in that prior disclosure, 60 major asbestos manufacturers/producers, included closed accounts as well as a few accounts where ACE never had exposure. The table above reflects all of our U.S. based direct exposure. Policies issued by the Westchester Specialty operations are included above in addition to exposures under direct policies that are liabilities of the Brandywine operations. In our prior disclosure the claim count related solely to Brandywine. For environmental, we face exposure for remediation costs and defense associated with property damage as a result of pollution. It is common, especially for larger defendants, to be named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at multiple sites. Our count definition in the table above is based on policyholder by site numbers. For example, if a policyholder is named as a PRP at ten sites it would generate ten counts. In addition, should we have multiple policyholders identified as PRPs at the same waste site, each would generate a count. In 2004, the number of newly reported sites for environmental has continued the downward decline experienced in recent years. The number of new sites in 2004 was 549, representing a decline of 23.8 percent over the 720 new sites reported in 2003. Closed site counts increased in the same time period from 1,277 in 2003 to 1,965 in 2004. The net result of this decline in new reports and increase in closings is a 16.5 percent decline in open counts at December 31, 2004 versus the year prior. Long term exposure cases represent a collection of latent claims each with the potential for a large number of claimants. The exposures range from silica to silicon breast implants to lead and other chemical exposures. Our definition of a count is similar to asbestos. A policyholder will generate one count for each causative agent regardless of the number of policies or claimants alleging injury. In 2004, the number of newly reported asbestos counts declined to 190 versus 320 new claims in 2003. As we note elsewhere in this filing, the fourth quarter charge for asbestos was primarily a result of increases in costs for a small number of major asbestos defendants and to a lesser extent newly reported counts. Reinsurance and Other Considerations relating to ACEs Ultimate A&E and other Run off Exposures Westchester Specialty As part of the acquisition of Westchester Specialty, National Indemnity Company (NICO) provided a 75 percent pro rata share of $1 billion of reinsurance protection for adverse development on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. At December 31, 2004, the remaining unused limit under this NICO Westchester Specialty cover was $515.8 million. Brandywine Run off Entities As part of the acquisition of the CIGNA P&C business, NICO provided $2.5 billion of reinsurance protection to Century on all Brandywine loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and on the A&E reserves of various ACE INA insurance subsidiaries reinsured by Century (in each case, including uncollectible reinsurance). The benefits of this NICO agreement (the Brandywine NICO Agreement) flow to the other Brandywine companies and to the ACE INA insurance subsidiaries through reinsurance agreements between those companies and Century. The Brandywine NICO Agreement was exhausted on an incurred basis with the increase in the A&E reserves in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition to housing a significant portion of our A&E exposure, the Brandywine operations include run off liabilities related to various insurance and reinsurance businesses. The following companies comprise ACEs Brandywine operations: Century, a Pennsylvania insurer, Century Re, ACE American Re, Brandywine Reinsurance Company S.A. N.V., a Belgium insurer (Brandywine SANV), Century International Reinsurance Company Ltd., a Bermuda insurer (CIRC), and Brandywine Reinsurance Company (UK) Ltd., a U.K. insurer (BRUK). All of the Brandywine companies are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Brandywine Holdings except for BRUK, which is a direct subsidiary of ACE INA International Holdings, Ltd. (ACE INA International Holdings). BRUKs liabilities have been ceded to Century through CIRC. The U.S. based ACE INA companies assumed two contractual obligations in respect of the Brandywine operations in connection with the Restructuring: a dividend retention fund obligation and a surplus maintenance obligation in the form of an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement. In accordance with the Brandywine restructuring order, INA Financial Corporation established and funded a dividend retention fund (the Dividend Retention Fund) consisting of $50 million plus investment earnings. The full balance of the Dividend Retention Fund was contributed to Century as of 62 Table of Contents December 31, 2002. To the extent future dividends are paid by INA Holdings Corporation to its parent, INA Financial Corporation, and to the extent INA Financial Corporation then pays such dividends to INA Corporation, a portion of those dividends must be withheld to replenish the principal of the Dividend Retention Fund to $50 million within five years. In 2004 and 2003, no such dividends were paid, and therefore no replenishment of the Dividend Retention Fund occurred. The obligation to maintain and to replenish the Dividend Retention Fund as necessary and to the extent dividends are paid is ongoing until ACE INA receives prior written approval from the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner to terminate the fund. In addition, the ACE INA insurance subsidiaries are obligated to provide insurance coverage to Century in the amount of $800 million under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement (the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement) if the statutory capital and surplus of Century falls below $25 million or if Century lacks liquid assets with which to pay claims as they become due, after giving effect to the contribution of the balance, if any, of the Dividend Retention Fund. Coverage under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement was triggered as of December 31, 2002 following contribution of the balance of the Dividend Retention Fund, because Centurys capital and surplus fell below $25 million at December 31, 2002. Effective December 31, 2004, ACE INA Holdings contributed $100 million to Century in exchange for a surplus note. After giving effect to the contribution and issuance of the surplus note, the statutory surplus of Century at December 31, 2004 was $25 million and approximately $458 million in statutory basis losses were ceded to the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement. Century reports the amount ceded under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement in accordance with statutory accounting principles, which differ from GAAP by, among other things, allowing Century to discount its asbestos and environmental reserves. For GAAP reporting purposes, intercompany reinsurance recoverables related to the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement are eliminated in consolidation. To estimate ACEs remaining claim exposure under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement under GAAP, we adjust the statutory cession to exclude the discount embedded in statutory loss reserves. At December 31, 2004, approximately $769 million in GAAP basis losses were ceded under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement, leaving a remaining limit of coverage under that agreement of approximately $31 million. If the limit of coverage were to be exhausted, ACEs results would nevertheless continue to recognize losses arising from any adverse loss reserve development of the Brandywine entities for so long as those companies remain consolidated subsidiaries of ACE. Uncertainties Relating to ACEs Ultimate Brandywine Exposure In addition to the Dividend Retention Fund and Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement commitments described above, certain ACE entities are primarily liable for asbestos, environmental and other exposures that they have reinsured to Century. Accordingly, if Century were to become insolvent and ACE were to lose control of Century, some or all of the recoverables due to these ACE companies from Century could become uncollectible, yet those ACE entities would continue to be responsible to pay claims to their insureds or reinsureds. Under such circumstances, ACE would recognize a loss in its consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate reinsurance balances ceded by the active ACE companies to Century were $1.58 billion. At December 31, 2004, Centurys carried reserves (including reserves ceded by the active ACE companies to Century) were $5.1 billion. We believe the intercompany reinsurance recoverables, which relate to liabilities payable over many years (i.e., 25 years or more), are not impaired at this time. The liabilities ceded to Century by its affiliates have in turn been ceded by Century to NICO and, as of December 31, 2004, approximately $2 billion of cover remains on a paid basis. As a result, any economic exposure there may be to adverse developments in the future is substantially less than the nominal value of the reinsurance recoverables. The impact of the transaction described below would reduce the balance due from Century to active ACE companies by $90 million. Should Centurys loss reserves experience adverse development in the future and should Century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation, the reinsurance recoverables due to Centurys affiliates would be payable only after the payment in full of all administrative expenses and direct policy liabilities. Thus, the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables. As of December 31, 2004, reserves ceded by Century to the active ACE companies and other amounts owed to Century by the ACE active companies were $930 million in the aggregate. In a lawsuit filed in California state court in December 1999 (AICCO, Inc v. Insurance Company of North America, et al.) certain competitors of ACE USA challenged the validity of the Restructuring under Californias Unfair Competition Law, Business and Professions Code Section 17200 (UCL). The lawsuit claims that the Restructuring is not applicable to California policyholders under the UCL because it constituted a transfer of liabilities without the consent of the policyholders. The suit also claims that the notice of the Restructuring was misleading. In November 2004, the voters of California approved Proposition 64 amending the UCL by, inter alia, requiring that lawsuits brought under the UCL be 63 Table of Contents brought by plaintiffs who have suffered actual injury as a result of the challenged business practice. In response to a motion to dismiss brought by ACE USA, the court ruled in February 2005 that the competitors/plaintiffs who brought this suit have not alleged actual injury as required by Proposition 64 and dismissed the suit. The time for appeal has not yet run and it is possible that the plaintiffs will appeal the ruling. Pending Sale of Certain Brandywine Companies Closing of the sale is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including without limitation the obtaining of all necessary consents and approvals from third parties, including the Pennsylvania Insurance Department and the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom, and the commutation of certain affiliate reinsurance agreements. In connection with certain of these commutations, Centurys assumed loss reserves would be reduced and an associated amount of coverage would become available under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement. We are pursuing potential options for the disposition of other Brandywine entities, including a possible sale of Century. There can be no assurance that any such sale or other disposition will be consummated. Legislative Initiatives Congress has been working on possible legislation to move all U.S. asbestos bodily injury claims to a federal trust for compensation in accordance with an established set of medical criteria and claim values. The trust would be funded by asbestos defendants and their insurers. As currently proposed, ACE would be one of the insurer participants. However, we cannot predict if any such proposed legislation will be modified or adopted. Reinsurance One of the ways we manage our loss exposure is through the use of reinsurance. While reinsurance agreements are designed to limit our losses from large exposures and permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses, reinsurance does not relieve us of our liability to our insureds. Accordingly, the losses and loss expense reserves on our balance sheet represent our total unpaid gross losses. The reinsurance recoverable represents anticipated recoveries of a portion of those gross unpaid losses as well as amounts recoverable from reinsurers with respect to claims paid. The table below presents our net reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2004 and 2003. December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and loss expenses $ 1,210 1,277 Bad debt reserve on paid losses and loss expenses (309 ) (403 ) Reinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits 15 15 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 14,585 12,965 Bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses (619 ) (557 ) Net reinsurance recoverable $ 14,882 $ 13,297 Our reinsurance recoverable and bad debt reserve on paid losses and loss expense decreased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to our decision to write off reinsurance recoverable balances (and associated bad debt reserves) which we believe to be uncollectible. This action had no significant impact on our net income. Reinsurance recoverable and bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses increased in 2004, primarily due to the A&E reserve strengthening, increased catastrophe losses and also due to foreign exchange revaluations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. For more information see Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Liquidity is a measure of a companys ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations. As a holding company, ACE possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries, and of other investments. In addition to net investment income, our cash flows currently depend 64 Table of Contents primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments. Historically, these dividends and other payments have come from our Bermuda based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our Bermuda subsidiaries. As an insurance company, one of our principal responsibilities to our clients is to ensure that we have ready access to funds to settle large unforeseen claims. Given anticipated growth in premiums and a lengthening of the average duration of our claim liabilities due to a higher proportionate growth in long tail relative to short tail business, we expect that positive cash flow from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios through 2005. To further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims, we hold a certain amount of invested assets in cash and short term investments and maintain available credit facilities. In addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, such as loss portfolio contracts, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration matched with the related liabilities. With respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio, we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments. In a low rate environment, the overall duration of our fixed maturity investments tends to be shorter and in a high rate environment, such durations tend to be longer. Given the current low rate environment, at December 31, 2004, the average duration of our fixed maturity investments (3.4 years) is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities (4.1 years). Despite our safeguards, if paid losses accelerated beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time or large scale uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers credit problems or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables). Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund loss payments were sold at depressed prices. Because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the ACE group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. As a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. If such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, we may be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations. With respect to the catastrophe losses during 2004, we anticipate all loss payments will be funded in the ordinary course of business due to positive operating cash flow combined with adequate balances of cash and short term investments. The payments of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies, which are discussed below. During 2004, we were able to meet all of our obligations, including the payment of dividends declared on our Ordinary Shares and Preferred Shares, with our net cash flow and dividends received. Should the need arise, we generally have access to the debt markets and other available credit facilities that are discussed below. We assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. Considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiarys financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. The legal restrictions on the payment of dividends from retained earnings by our Bermuda subsidiaries are currently satisfied by the share capital and additional paid in capital of each of the Bermuda subsidiaries. During 2004, ACE Bermuda and ACE Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd declared and paid dividends of $227 million and $259 million, respectively. During 2003, ACE Bermuda declared and paid dividends of $478 million, and ACE Cap Re International Ltd. declared and paid dividends of $25 million. We expect that a majority of our cash inflows for 2005 will be from our Bermuda subsidiaries. The payment of any dividends from ACE Global Markets or its subsidiaries would be subject to applicable U.K. insurance laws and regulations including those promulgated by the Society of Lloyds. ACE INAs U.S. insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, only from earned surplus and subject to certain annual limitations and the maintenance of a minimum capital requirement. ACE INAs international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. These laws and regulations include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. We did not receive any dividends from ACE Global Markets or ACE INA in 2004 or 2003. Under the Lloyds accounting model, syndicates in Lloyds operate each year as an annual venture. Each year of account is held open for three years. At the end of three years, the year of account purchases reinsurance from the next open year, which is known as reinsurance to close or RITC, and distributes the remaining funds to the investors in the syndicate. ACE Global Markets has historically 65 Table of Contents retained these funds for operational purposes. ACE INA issued debt to provide partial financing for the ACE INA acquisition and for other operating needs. This debt is serviced by dividends paid by ACE INAs insurance subsidiaries to ACE INA as well as other group resources. Our sale of 65.3 percent of the common shares of Assured Guaranty in the second quarter generated proceeds, net of offering costs, of approximately $835 million and a return of capital of $200 million from Assured Guaranty, which were used to support our P&C business and strengthen our balance sheet capital position. Our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, net investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Funds are used primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, dividends and for the purchase of investments. After satisfying our cash requirements, excess cash flows from these underwriting and investing activities are invested. Our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. Generally cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. The irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. Refer to the section entitled, Contractual Obligations and Commitments for our estimate of future claim payments by period. Sources of liquidity include cash from operations, financing arrangements or routine sales of investments. Our consolidated net cash flows from operating activities were $5 billion in 2004, compared with $4.3 billion in 2003 and $2.5 billion in 2002. These amounts reflect net income for each year, adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital. Despite lower net income in 2004, net cash flows from operating activities increased, primarily due to an increase in net unpaid losses and loss expenses, compared with 2003. The increase in net cash flows from operating activities in 2003, compared with 2002, was primarily driven by higher net income and net unpaid losses and loss expenses, partially offset by lower unearned premiums. Typically, the adjustments to net income reflect the fact that there is a significant period of time between the recording of a loss (ranging up to several years or more) and the actual claim payment. Our consolidated net cash flows used for investing activities increased to $4.9 billion in 2004, and was net of $958 million received from the sale of Assured Guaranty (net of cash sold). This compares with net cash flows used for investing activities of $4.8 billion and $2 billion in 2003 and 2002, respectively. These increases reflect our strong consolidated net cash flows from operating activities. Net purchases of fixed maturities were $5 billion in 2004, compared with $4.9 billion and $2 billion in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our consolidated net cash flows used for financing activities were $155 million in 2004. This compares with net cash flows from financing activities of $395 million in 2003 and net cash flows used for financing activities of $491 million in 2002. Net cash flow usage for 2004 was related to increased dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of options. The 2004 year also included net proceeds of $500 million from our debt issuance, which was partially offset by the repayment of debt and trust preferred securities of $475 million. The 2003 year included net proceeds of $557 million from our Preferred Share issuance. Net cash flows used for financing activities in 2002 were primarily driven by the repayment of $400 million of trust preferred securities. Although our ongoing operations continue to generate positive cash flows, our cash flows are currently impacted by a large book of loss reserves from businesses in run off. The run off operations generated negative operating cash flows of $88 million in 2004, compared with $645 million and $525 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily due to claim payments. The decrease in negative operating cash flows for 2004 relates primarily to funds received under the NICO agreement of $402 million. Both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Claim settlements, premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. In many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss. We believe that our cash balances, cash flow from operations, routine sales of investments and the liquidity provided by our credit facilities, as discussed below are adequate to meet expected cash requirements. ACE and its subsidiaries are assigned debt and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including S&P, A.M. Best, Moodys Investors Service and Fitch IBCA. The ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. Our website, acelimited.com, also contains some information about our ratings, which can be found under the Investor Information tab. Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies. Independent ratings are one of the important factors that estab 66 Table of Contents lish our competitive position in the insurance markets. The rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. These ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. Debt ratings apply to short and long term debt as well as preferred stock. These ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of principal and interest and preferred stock dividends. It is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. If one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. In addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. Capital Resources Capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations. The following table summarizes the components of our capital resources at December 31, 2004 and 2003. December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) Short term debt $ 146 $ 546 Long term debt 1,849 1,349 Total debt 1,995 1,895 Trust preferred securities 412 475 Preferred shares 557 557 Ordinary shareholders equity 9,288 8,266 Total shareholders equity 9,845 8,823 Total capitalization $ 12,252 $ 11,193 Ratio of debt to total capitalization 16.3% 16.9% Ratio of debt plus trust preferreds to total capitalization 19.6% 21.2% We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short term and long term basis. Our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. We have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. As part of our capital management program, in November 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of any ACE issued debt or capital securities including Ordinary Shares, up to $250 million. At December 31, 2004, this authorization had not been utilized. During 2004, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC relating to the issuance of up to $1.5 billion of certain types of debt and equity securities. This registration became effective during the first quarter of 2005. 67 Table of Contents Shareholders Equity The following table analyzes the movements in our shareholders equity for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Balance, beginning of year $ 8,823 $ 6,271 $ 6,012 Net income 1,153 1,483 100 Change in net unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax (50 ) 208 339 Dividends declared Ordinary Shares (233 ) (204 ) (173 ) Dividends declared Preferred Shares (45 ) (23 ) Cumulative translation adjustments 99 107 (7 ) Other movements, net 98 123 26 Dividends declared Mezzanine equity (10 ) (26 ) Issuance of Preferred Shares 557 Conversion of Mezzanine equity 311 Balance, end of year $ 9,845 $ 8,823 $ 6,271 Our diluted book value per Ordinary Share increased to $32.51 at December 31, 2004, compared with $29.42 at December 31, 2003. In calculating our diluted book value per Ordinary Share, we include in the money options in the denominator. The expected proceeds from the in the money options are included in the numerator. Shareholders equity increased $1 billion in 2004, primarily due to net income of $1.2 billion, cumulative translation adjustments of $99 million and the exercise of options for Ordinary Shares of $83 million (included in other movements, net), partially offset by dividends declared of $278 million. Also included in other movements, net, are changes in the accumulated benefits obligation for certain of our foreign defined benefit plans. The change was an increase in 2004, primarily due to decreases in the discount rate assumed in each year compared with the prior year, partially offset by increases in the underlying investment portfolio at the end of each year. On January 14, 2004 and April 14, 2004, we paid dividends of 19 cents per Ordinary Share to shareholders of record on December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004, respectively. On July 14, 2004, October 14, 2004, and January 14, 2005, we paid dividends of 21 cents per Ordinary Share to shareholders on record on June 30, 2004, September 30, 2004, and December 31, 2004, respectively. We have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in 1993. However, the declaration, payment and value of future dividends on Ordinary Shares is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our profits, financial requirements and other factors, including legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. Dividends on the Preferred Shares are payable quarterly, in arrears, when and if declared by our Board of Directors. In 2004, we paid dividends of $4.875 per Preferred Share (which translates to 48.75 cents per Depositary Share) on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1, to shareholders of record on February 29, May 31, August 31, and November 30, respectively. 68 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments The table below shows our contractual obligations and commitments including our payments due by period at December 31, 2004: Payments Due By Period (in millions of U.S. dollars)(Restated) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Payment amounts determinable from the contract Deposit liabilities $ 343 $ 110 $ 98 $ 44 $ 91 Operating leases 386 72 97 71 146 Short term debt 146 146 Long term debt 1,849 800 450 599 Trust preferred securities 412 412 Total obligations in which payment amounts are determinable from the contract 3,136 328 995 565 1,248 Payment amounts not determinable from the contract Estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts 31,483 6,001 10,412 3,261 11,809 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 34,619 $ 6,329 $ 11,407 $ 3,826 $ 13,057 The above table excludes pension obligations, funding commitments to limited partnerships and future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts. Minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations are immaterial over the next year. Subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary due to many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time. In connection with our investments in limited partnerships, we have commitments that may require funding of up to $93 million over the next several years. As the timing of payment of these commitments is unknown, we have excluded the amount from the above table. We establish reserves for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts, including, but not limited to, GMDBs and GMIBs. Payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract. We estimate that on a discounted basis, we expect to pay $509 million associated with these obligations, the majority of which will be paid in excess of five years. Deposit Liabilities Deposit liabilities of $343 million include reinsurance deposit liabilities of $238 million and contract holder deposit funds of $105 million. Contract holder deposit funds represent a liability for investment contracts sold that do not meet the definition of an insurance contract under FAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long Duration Contracts and Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments. The investment contracts are sold with a guaranteed rate of return. The proceeds are then invested with the intent of realizing a greater return than is called for in the investment contracts. Operating Lease Commitments We lease office space in most countries in which we operate under operating leases that expire at various dates through January 2018. We renew and enter into new leases in the ordinary course of business as required. Short term Debt From time to time, we use securities repurchase agreements as a source of short term liquidity. Under these repurchase agreements, we agree to sell securities and repurchase them at a future date for a predetermined price, thereby creating liquidity. The covenants of our existing credit facilities limit our borrowing under repurchase agreements to $800 million. At December 31, 2004, $146 million of reverse purchase agreements were outstanding. The proceeds were used to repay maturing commercial paper. Included in short term debt for 2003 was ACE INAs $400 million, 8.2 percent notes which became due on August 15, 2004. We repaid these notes in 2004. 69 Table of Contents In June 1999, we arranged certain commercial paper programs. The programs use revolving credit facilities as back up facilities and provide for up to $2.8 billion in commercial paper issuance (subject to the availability of back up facilities, which currently total $600 million) for ACE and for ACE INA. Long term Debt Our total long term debt of $1.8 billion is described in detail in Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2004, we issued $500 million of ACE INA 5.875 percent senior notes due June 15, 2014. The proceeds of the notes were used, to repay $75 million of Capital Re trust preferred securities, $400 million of ACE INA 8.2 percent notes due in 2004, and for general corporate purposes. The following instruments have specific collateral triggers. In 1998, ACE US Holdings issued $250 million of unsecured senior notes that mature in October 2008. In December 1999, ACE INA issued $300 million of unsecured subordinated notes that mature in December 2009 we repaid $100 million of this outstanding amount during 2002. We have a $450 million credit default swap in place that has the economic effect of reducing our cost of borrowing associated with these two issuances. The minimum collateral in connection with the credit default swap is $158 million. The actual collateral can be higher depending on the credit quality of securities pledged. Under these transactions, we would be required to provide collateral of $450 million if S&P downgraded our debt rating to BB+ or lower, or downgraded ACE Bermudas financial strength rating to BBB or lower. Although there can be no assurance, we believe it is unlikely that either of these two events will occur. In the event that we terminate either of the swaps prematurely, we would be liable for certain transaction costs. The counter party in each swap is a highly rated major financial institution and management does not anticipate non performance. Trust Preferred Securities During 1999 and 2000, we issued $800 million of trust preferred securities. The funds generated from these issues were used to partially finance the ACE INA acquisition. In 2002, $400 million of the trust preferred securities matured and were repaid. In 2004, we repaid an additional $75 million (Capital Re trust preferred securities). The securities outstanding consist of $400 million of company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred shares ($100 million and $300 million) issued by two business trusts wholly owned by us. Each of the two remaining series of trust preferred securities was issued by a special purpose entity (two trusts) that is wholly owned by us. The sole assets of the special purpose entities are debt instruments issued by one or more of our subsidiaries. The special purpose entities look to payments on the debt instruments to make payments on the preferred securities. We have guaranteed the payments on these debt securities. The trustees of the trusts include one or more of our officers and at least one independent trustee, such as a trust company. Our officers serving as trustees of the trusts do not receive any compensation or other remuneration for their services in such capacity. The full $412 million of outstanding trust preferred stock (calculated as $400 million as discussed above plus our equity share of the two trusts) is shown on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. Additional information with respect to the trust preferred securities is contained in Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimated Gross Loss Payments under Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts We are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts. As a P&C insurance and reinsurance company, such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation. In contrast to other contractual obligations, cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract. For example, we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts (i.e., when a loss event has not occurred) and if a payment is to be made, the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract. In the table above, we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and do not take reinsurance recoverables into account. These estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material. Given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of losses and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future losses and loss expense payments in the table above, differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates. 70 Table of Contents Credit Facilities As our Bermuda subsidiaries are not admitted insurers and reinsurers in the U.S., the terms of certain U.S. insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide LOCs to clients. In addition, ACE Global Markets is required to satisfy certain U.S. regulatory trust fund requirements which can be met by the issuance of LOCs. LOCs may also be used for general corporate purposes. The following table shows our credit facilities by credit line, usage and expiry date at December 31, 2004.

On July 1, 2005, this facility was replaced by a letter of credit permitting the issuance of up to $500 million of LOCs on a secured basis and expiring on July 1, 2010. 4. These facilities are issued in the name of ACE European Group Limited, Lloyds Syndicate 2488 and Century Indemnity Insurance Company. 5. On July 1, 2005, this facility was replaced by a letter of credit permitting the issuance of up to $1 billion of LOCs on an unsecured basis and expiring on July 1, 2010. 6. In January 2005, this facility was cancelled and its letter of credit usage was transferred to other operational LOC facilities 7. Supports ACE Global Markets underwriting capacity for Lloyds Syndicate 2488 2005 capacity of &pound;400 million (approximately $750 million). During the second quarter of 2005, this facility was reduced from &pound;380 million to &pound;284 million. With the exception of the LOC facilities noted under Other, the facilities noted above require that we maintain certain covenants, all of which have been met at December 31, 2004. These covenants include: (i) maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth covenant of not less than $6.0 billion (subject to a reset provision on the last day of each fiscal year) plus 25 percent of cumulative net income since December 31, 2003 (subject to a reset provision on the last day of each fiscal year), plus 50 percent of net proceeds of any issuance of equity interests subsequent to December 31, 2003 (subject to a reset provision on the last day of each fiscal year); and (ii) maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1. Under this covenant, debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity, except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than 15 percent. In this circumstance, the amount greater than 15 percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2004, (a) the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in (i) above was $6.3 billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was $9.2 billion; and (b) our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 0.16 to 1. In addition to these covenants, the Funds at Lloyds capital facility requires that collateral be posted if the financial strength rating of ACE Limited falls to S&P BBB+ or lower. Our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. This could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize letters of credit under such facility. An event of default under one or more credit facilities with outstanding credit extensions of $25 million or more would result in an event of default under all of the facilities described above.  American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) was signed into law by the President of the United States. The Act provides for the election of a special one time tax deduction of 85 percent of certain foreign earnings that are 71 Table of Contents repatriated (as defined in the Act) under a Domestic Reinvestment Plan to its United States parent corporation in either the parents last tax year that began before the enactment date, or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the date of enactment. We expect to apply the provisions of the Act to certain of our applicable subsidiaries. In January and May 2005, the United States Treasury issued its guidance on selected provisions of the Act and on July 21, 2005, the Tax Technical Corrections Act of 2005 was introduced (H.R. 3376 and S.1447). Guidance issued to date provides clarification on several technical issues, with the remaining issues addressed in the proposed Technical Corrections Act. We repatriated foreign earnings of approximately $367 million, during the six months ended June 30, 2005, subject to Domestic Reinvestment Plans that would qualify under the Act based on the guidance issued to date. Of the $367 million repatriated foreign earnings to date, approximately $250 million will qualify for preferential tax treatment. The tax benefit associated with these repatriations was $27 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005, and was a result of the reduction of the net deferred tax liability associated with these repatriated earnings, based on guidance issued to date. The tax benefit recorded to date may increase by as much as approximately $7 million if the Tax Technical Corrections Act is passed. Additional earnings repatriations up to the limitation under the Act of $500 million may be completed through the remainder of 2005. Based on guidance issued to date, we are evaluating potential additional repatriations and are not in a position to complete our evaluation or determine the total associated tax impact as a result of the Act. However, based on our analysis to date, it is possible that we may ultimately repatriate up to an additional $250 million up to the limitation of qualifying dividends, with an associated tax benefit of up to $44 million. We expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by September 2005. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We are exposed to potential loss to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Further, through the writings of certain products such as credit derivatives (through our 34.7 percent ownership of Assured Guaranty), GMIBs and GMDBs, we are exposed to deterioration in the credit markets, decreases in interest rates and declines in the equity markets. Our investment portfolio consists of both fixed income and equity securities, denominated in both U.S. and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. As our fixed income and equity securities are classified as available for sale, changes in interest rates, equity prices or foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate affect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate affect on net income. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates and equity prices affect consolidated net income when, and if, a security is sold or impaired. From time to time, we also use investment derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market. In addition, as part of our investing activity, we purchase TBAs. These instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and are sensitive to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are included in our net realized gains or losses and therefore have an immediate affect on both our net income and shareholders equity. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our notional exposure to investment derivative instruments was $3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased use of swaps, futures and options and the increase in our investment portfolio. We seek to mitigate market risk using a number of techniques, including maintaining and managing the assets and liabilities of our international operations consistent with the foreign currencies of the underlying insurance and reinsurance businesses, thereby limiting exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies. Also, from time to time, we enter into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing certain investment portfolio exposures. 72 Table of Contents The following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at December 31, 2004. Our policies to address these risks in 2004 were unchanged from 2003. We do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods. Interest rate risk Our exposure to interest rate risk is primarily concentrated in our fixed income portfolio, our debt obligations and to a lesser extent, our GMIB reinsurance business. Changes in investment values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves and debt obligations. We monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our asset and liability positions. The following table shows the impact on the market value of our fixed income portfolio and debt obligations of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve (an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario) at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 Fair value of fixed income portfolio $ 25,044 $ 21,266 Pre tax impact of 100 basis point increase in interest rates $ 800 $ 696 Percentage of total fixed income portfolio 3.2% 3.3% Changes in interest rates will have an immediate affect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate affect on net income. Although our debt, preferred stock, and trust preferred securities (collectively, referred to as debt obligations) are reported at amortized value and not adjusted for fair value changes, changes in interest rates could have a material impact on their fair value, albeit there is no immediate impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2004, the amortized value of our debt obligations was $2.8 billion and the fair value was $3.1 billion. An increase in interest rates of 100 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our debt obligations of 6.7 percent at December 31, 2004. This equates to a pre tax decrease in the fair value of our debt obligations of $209 million at December 31, 2004. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of prepayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables. Our net income is directly impacted by changes in the fair value of GMIBs. For example, net realized gains of $10 million were reported for GMIB reinsurance for the year ended December 31, 2004. The changes in the fair value of GMIBs are determined using internal valuation models. Such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty. The valuation of these products is subject to fluctuations arising from, among other factors, changes in interest rates, changes in the equity markets, and changes in the allocation of the investments underlying annuitants account value. These models and the related assumptions are continually reviewed by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely information, such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities. Based on in force annuities covered by GMIB reinsurance treaties at December 31, 2004, we estimate that a downward parallel shift of the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $147 million. This estimated change in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Equity price risk Our portfolio of equity securities, which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value, has exposure to price risk. This risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices. In addition, we attain exposure to the equity markets through the use of derivative instruments, which also have exposure to price risk. Our U.S. equity portfolio is correlated with the S&P 500 index and changes in that index would approximate the impact on our portfolio. 73 Table of Contents Our international equity portfolio has exposure to a broad range of non U.S. equity markets. The following table provides more information on our exposure to equity price risk at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) Fair value of equity securities $ 1,266 $ 562 Fair value of equity derivative instruments 131 118 Total equity exposure $ 1,397 $ 680 Pre tax impact of 10 percent decline in market prices for equity exposures $ 140 $ 68 Changes in fair value of the derivative equity instruments are recorded as net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. As discussed above, our net income is directly impacted by changes in the fair value of GMIBs. Based on in force annuities covered by GMIB reinsurance treaties at December 31, 2004, we estimated that a 10 percent decline in the S&P index would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $55 million. This estimated change in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Foreign currency exchange rate risk Many of our non U.S. companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies. Therefore, foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies. Foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process. Locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements, and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the British pound sterling, the euro and the Canadian dollar. The following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies $ 1,555 $ 825 Percentage of fair value of total net assets 15.8 % 9.3 % Pre tax impact of hypothetical 10% strengthening of U.S. dollar* $ 100 $ 65 * Versus the British pound sterling, the euro and the Canadian dollar 
 
ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes presented on pages F 1 to F 78 of this Form 10 K/A. Overview ACE Limited (ACE) is the Bermuda based holding company of the ACE Group of Companies, incorporated with limited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Law. We created our business office in Bermuda in 1985 when we initially incorporated the Company and we continue to maintain our corporate headquarters in Bermuda. Through our various operating subsidiaries, we provide a broad range of insurance and reinsurance products to businesses and individuals worldwide through operations in the U.S. and more than 50 other countries. Our long term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income. By doing so, we provide value to our clients and shareholders through the utilization of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets. As an insurance and reinsurance company, we generate gross revenues from two principal sources, premiums which are usually paid in advance of loss payments, and dividends and interest income earned on invested assets. Cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses. Generally, when an insurance company writing long tail business grows, as ACE has over the last two years, its cash flows tend to be positive. ACE generated approximately $5 billion in positive operating cash flow in 2004 while invested assets over this period also increased by $4.9 billion. Invested assets are generally held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration. We also invest a small portion of our assets in less liquid or higher risk assets in an attempt to achieve higher risk adjusted returns. Claims payments in any short term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements. The value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility and credit events such as corporate defaults. The actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends, inflation rates, court awards and catastrophes. We believe that our cash balances, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet any unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead. The insurance industry is highly competitive with many companies offering similar coverage. Until recently, the insurance market had been characterized by sharply rising rates on new and renewal business, combined with restrictive terms and conditions. In 2004, we observed rate reductions across several classes and although we have continued to report growth in net premiums written, the rate of growth declined in 2004, compared with 2003 and 2002. This is a reflection of our underwriting discipline in the face of a weakening market, partially offset by our increased market and product presence both in the U.S. and throughout the world. We believe the market overall remains stable and rates, terms and conditions overall are reasonable despite the downward pressure on rates which has continued into the first quarter of 2005. 2004 was a record year for property catastrophe losses for the insurance industry. We incurred net losses of $499 million in 2004, primarily relating to hurricanes which struck the Caribbean and the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, typhoons which impacted Asia. The tsunami disaster had no material impact on our operating results and financial condition. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we increased our reserve for asbestos, environmental and other run off claims by $465 million, which resulted in an after tax charge to net income of $302 million. The net additions comprised asbestos and environmental (A&E) reserve increases of $554 million including the provision for bad debts of $95 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. For more information, refer to the section entitled Asbestos and Environmental and other Run off Liabilities. We are closely following developments on possible legislation to move all U.S. asbestos bodily injury claims to a federal trust for compensation in accordance with an established set of medical criteria and claim values. The trust would be funded by asbestos defendants and their insurers. As currently 26 Table of Contents proposed, ACE would be one of the insurer participants. However, we cannot predict if any such proposed legislation will be modified or adopted. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements Subpoenas, interrogatories and civil investigative demands ACE, its subsidiaries and affiliates have received numerous subpoenas, interrogatories, and civil investigative demands in connection with the ongoing investigations of insurance industry practices. These inquiries have been issued by a number of attorneys general, state and federal regulatory authorities, and state insurance departments, including the New York Attorney General, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. These inquiries seek information concerning underwriting practices with respect to non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products, often referred to as finite risk reinsurance. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with such inquiries. Independent investigation, internal review, and related findings The independent investigation of ACEs purchase and sale of finite risk contracts, which has been conducted concurrently by three outside law firms under the direction of the Audit Committee of ACEs Board of Directors, is essentially complete. Based on an assessment of contracts purchased, sold, and entered into among ACE subsidiaries and affiliates, more than 100 contracts identified as finite risk insurance or reinsurance were subject to review during the investigation. In addition, ACEs management reviewed these and other transactions as part of its own internal review of finite risk contracts. The independent investigation encompassed all business units of ACE, thousands of files, e mails and interviews with current and former employees of ACE. The Audit Committee and its independent investigation team believe that the scope and process of its internal review has been sufficient to determine whether finite risk contracts purchased or sold by ACE were improperly accounted for as insurance, rather than as deposits. As a result of the findings of the independent investigation and ACEs internal review, and in consultation with its independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC or independent auditors), ACE has concluded that the accounting for certain transactions was incorrect and the financial statements need to be restated. Restatement On July 18, 2005, ACEs Board of Directors approved managements recommendation to correct its accounting for eight contracts pursuant to the conclusions of the independent investigation and internal review. The eight contracts consist of three reinsurance contracts purchased by ACE or a predecessor organization, three contracts sold by ACE, and two intercompany transactions. Of these, management determined that seven did not meet applicable risk transfer requirements and should have been recorded as deposits. Each of these eight contracts originated prior to 2002. Some of these contracts involved written or oral agreements, understandings or discussions pertaining to risk expectations that were inappropriately not factored into the accounting treatment at the time of origination. In certain instances, agreements of this sort reduced or eliminated the anticipated risk transfer upon which the original accounting was based and resulted in the need for correction and the restatement of prior years financial statements. Only two of such contracts were in force at December 31, 2004. In addition to the eight contracts identified in the investigation, the Company has corrected the accounting for certain deferred compensation plans as well as certain unrelated, previously known errors, which were considered immaterial to require a restatement, but had been corrected in the periods identified. Pursuant to these corrections, the Company has restated its previously reported financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000, as well as each of the quarters in the years 2004 and 2003. Consequently, ACEs previously issued financial statements for these periods should no longer be relied upon. The restatement had no effect on the debt covenants. The aggregate net effect of these corrections is to increase 2004 net income by $14 million; increase 2003 net income by $65 million; increase 2002 net income by $23 million; decrease 2001 net income by $34 million; and decrease 2000 net income by $26 million. For further details on the effect of the restatement see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. All amounts included herein have been adjusted to reflect the restatement. 27 Table of Contents Insurance Industry Investigations and Related Matters On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General (NYAG) filed a civil suit against Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. (Marsh), alleging that certain Marsh business practices were fraudulent and violated antitrust and securities laws. ACE was not named as a defendant in the suit, although ACE was named as one of four insurance companies whose employees participated in the practices in question. There can be no assurance that ACE will not be named in future actions brought by the NYAG or any other state attorneys general. In addition, an underwriter who is no longer employed by ACE has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor based on these practices. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the attorneys general. ACE, its subsidiaries and affiliates have received numerous subpoenas, interrogatories, and civil investigative demands in connection with the pending investigations of insurance industry practices. These inquiries have been issued by a number of attorneys general, state departments of insurance, and state and federal regulatory authorities, including the NYAG, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. These inquiries seek information concerning underwriting practices and non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with such inquiries. ACE has been conducting its own investigation that encompassed the subjects raised by the NYAG, the other state attorneys general and the SEC. The investigation has been conducted by a team from the firm of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. The team is headed by former United States Attorney Mary Jo White and has operated under the direction of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has retained Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton, special outside counsel, to advise it in connection with these matters. ACE has terminated three employees, one of whom has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and has suspended two other employees as a result of the internal investigation. ACEs internal investigations pertaining to underwriting practices and non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products are essentially complete. (See Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information concerning the investigation into non traditional or loss mitigation products). In January 2005, the Connecticut Attorney General (the CTAG) filed a civil suit against a subsidiary of ACE in Connecticut state court under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. The CTAGs suit alleges that an ACE subsidiary made an unauthorized and undisclosed payment to a broker who placed a portfolio of state workers compensation cases with ACE and seeks restitution to the state and payment of punitive damages. ACE believes that it has not violated any law or duty to the state and has filed a motion to dismiss the action. The State of Connecticut has not yet responded to the motion. ACE, ACE INA Holdings, Inc. and ACE USA have been named in the following federal putative nationwide class actions brought by insurance policyholders. Bayou Steel Corporation v. ACE INA Holdings, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 5391 E.D. Pa) (filed November 18, 2004); Eagle Creek, Inc. v. ACE INA Holdings, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 5255; E.D. Pa.)

(filed May 20, 2005) (Case removed from state court. Motion to remand is pending). In each of these cases, the plaintiff has sued a number of other insurance entities in addition to the ACE entities. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated these cases, as well as other putative class actions in which no ACE entity is named as a party in the District of New Jersey. 28 Table of Contents On August 1, 2005, Plaintiffs filed two consolidated amended complaints one concerning commercial insurance and the other concerning employee benefit plans. In the commercial insurance complaint, the plaintiffs named ACE Limited, ACE INA Holdings, Inc., ACE USA, Inc., ACE American Insurance Co., Illinois Union Insurance Co., and Indemnity Insurance Co. of North America. They allege that insurers, including certain ACE entities, and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of B quotes and contingent commissions. In addition, the complaints allege that the broker defendants received additional income by improperly placing their clients business with insurers through related wholesale entities that act as intermediaries between the broker and insurer. Plaintiffs also allege that broker defendants tied the purchase of primary insurance with the placement of such coverage with reinsurance carriers through the broker defendants reinsurance broker subsidiaries. In the commercial insurance consolidated complaint, plaintiffs assert the following causes of action against ACE: Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), federal antitrust law, state antitrust law, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. In the employee benefits complaint, the plaintiffs named ACE Limited, ACE USA, and Insurance Company of North America. They allege that insurers, including certain ACE entities, and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of B quotes and contingent commissions. In addition, the complaints allege that the broker defendants received additional income by improperly placing their clients business with insurers through related wholesale entities that act as intermediaries between the broker and insurer. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants improperly charged communication fees, which plaintiffs claim are also known as enrollment fees or service/administrative fees. Plaintiffs also allege that insurers transferred their insureds business, with who they had direct contracts with and no broker involvement, to insurance brokers in exchange for the insurance brokers steering additional business to the insurers. Plaintiffs also allege that broker defendants tied the purchase of primary insurance with the placement of such coverage with reinsurance carriers through the broker defendants reinsurance broker subsidiaries. In the employee benefits consolidated complaint, plaintiffs assert the following causes of action against ACE: Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), federal antitrust law, state antitrust law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. In both cases, the plaintiffs have sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. Illinois Union Insurance Company, an ACE subsidiary, has been named in a state court class action: Van Emden Management Corporation v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., et al. (Case No. 05 0066A; Superior Court of Massachusetts) (filed January 13, 2005). The allegations are similar to the allegations in the federal class actions identified above. Plaintiffs assert causes of action under Massachusetts antitrust statute and Massachusetts consumer protection statute. Plaintiffs also assert a conspiracy cause of action and seek an injunction. Plaintiffs have sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE American Insurance Co., an ACE subsidiary, has been named in a state court lawsuit in Florida: Office Depot, Inc. v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. et al. (Case No. 502005CA004396; Circuit Court of the 15th Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach County Florida) (filed June 22, 2005). The allegations are similar to the allegations in the federal class actions identified above. Plaintiffs assert the following causes of action against ACE American Insurance Co.: conspiracy and concerted action to aid and abet Marshs breaches of fiduciary duties, conspiracy and concerted action to aid and abet Marshs fraud, antitrust violation under Florida law, deceptive and unfair trade practices, unjust enrichment, civil RICO under Florida law, commercial bribery, and punitive damages. Plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE has been named in the following four putative securities class action suits: John Mahaney, Jr. v. ACE Limited, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 07696; S.D.N.Y) (filed October 18, 2004); Steven Burda v. ACE Limited, et al.; (Case No. 04 CV 833; S.D.N.Y.) (filed October 21, 2004); Thomas E. Barton v. ACE Limited, et al.; (Case No. 04 CV 8683; S.D.N.Y.) (filed November 1, 2004); and Friends of Ariel Center for Policy Research v. ACE Limited, et al. (Case No. 04 CV 04907; E.D. Pa.) (filed October 19, 2004). Evan G. Greenberg, ACEs President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Duperreault, ACEs Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, and Philip V. Bancroft, ACEs Chief Financial Officer were also named as defendants in each of these suits. In addition, Dominic J. Frederico, ACEs former Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Christopher Z. Marshall, ACEs former Chief Financial Officer, were named as defendants in the Burda action. On January 3, 2005, the Burda and Barton actions were consolidated for all purposes into the Mahaney action. In December 2004, the defendants filed a motion with the JPML seeking consolidation of the cases for pretrial purposes in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The JPML granted that motion, consolidating the four cases in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The lead plaintiff has not been chosen in the consolidated proceeding. Nor has a consolidated complaint been filed. In the four complaints, 29 Table of Contents the plaintiffs assert claims solely under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), Rule 10b 5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (control person liability). The plaintiffs allege that ACEs public statements and securities filings should have revealed that insurers, including certain ACE entities and brokers conspired to increase premiums and allocate customers through the use of B quotes and contingent commissions and that ACEs revenue and earnings were inflated by premiums which it may have to forfeit by fines or judgments. ACE understands that it has been named as a defendant in a derivative suit filed in Delaware Chancery Court by shareholders of Marsh. The derivative suit seeks to recover damages for Marsh and its subsidiary, Marsh, Inc., against officers and directors of Marsh, American International Group Inc. (AIG), AIGs chief executive officer, and ACE. The suit alleges that the defendants damaged Marsh and Marsh, Inc. by participating in a bid rigging scheme and obtaining kickbacks in the form of contingent commissions. The suit alleges that ACE knowingly participated in the officers and directors breaches of fiduciary duty to Marsh, Inc. and Marsh. The plaintiff has sought unspecified compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, including legal fees. ACE has not been served in this action, though no assurance can be given that it will not be served. ACE Limited and Evan Greenberg, as a former officer and director of AIG, have been named in In re American International Group, Inc. (AIG) Derivative Litigation, which is a shareholder derivative action brought by AIGs shareholders. The allegations against ACE concern the alleged bid rigging and contingent commission scheme as similarly alleged in the federal policyholder cases. Plaintiffs assert the following causes of action against ACE: breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duties. All of these suits merely seek compensatory damages without specifying an amount. As a result, ACE cannot at this time estimate its potential costs related to these legal matters and accordingly no liability for compensatory damages has been established in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, in the year ended December 31, 2004, we have recorded expenses for legal fees of $11.5 million in connection with these matters. Additionally, as of June 30, 2005, ACE has paid and accrued over $44 million for legal related fees since the investigation began. In the opinion of ACEs management, ACEs ultimate liability for these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on ACEs consolidated financial condition, although it is possible that the effect could be material to ACEs consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Catastrophe Exposure Management We have exposure to catastrophic event risks from global insurance and reinsurance writings of property and workers compensation and, to a lesser extent, marine, aviation and energy. This potential loss accumulation, caused by either man made (for example, terrorism, aviation) or natural perils (for example, hurricane, earthquake) is addressed using several different approaches. First, we have established a series of Product Boards to ensure that geographic, product and client exposures are appropriate and meet both account level and portfolio limit guidelines adopted by the Boards. Second, we have a standardized modeling approach across ACE that utilizes a third party probabilistic catastrophe simulation software package. Each unit with catastrophe exposure is required to model, price and manage its catastrophe risk using the software. The software allows the aggregation of risk within and across business units. In addition, we maintain minimum data quality standards that must be met in order to quote and bind business. The aggregation of risk across units, products, perils and geography is performed across ACE on a quarterly basis to provide an overall assessment of risk and the results reviewed by senior management each quarter. Management maintains a prudent level of risk through a series of related accumulation thresholds that cap the net retention from single or multiple events; the probability of exhaustion of core catastrophe reinsurance programs, and the net catastrophe loss relative to tangible capital. Third, where the risk / return economics are effective, reinsurance is purchased from reinsurers of appropriate quality and security to protect the business unit level from accumulations arising either within product, peril or business unit or across a combination thereof such that the aggregate risk from a catastrophe loss is appropriate to the units capital structure. Despite the above controls there remains uncertainty about the characteristics, timing and extent of insured loss given the nature of catastrophes. 30 Table of Contents Catastrophe Loss Charges During 2004, we incurred net catastrophe related losses of $499 million, primarily associated with hurricanes which struck the Caribbean and the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, typhoons which impacted Asia. We believe that the nature and amount of this loss was consistent with our exposure management guidelines discussed above. The following table shows the impact of the catastrophe loss charges on each of our operating segments for the year ended December 31, 2004. Catastrophe Loss Charges By Event (in millions of U.S. dollars) Insurance NorthAmerican Insurance OverseasGeneral GlobalReinsurance* ConsolidatedP&C FinancialServices Total Gross loss $ 426 $ 157 $ 315 $ 898 $ 11 $ 909 Net loss Hurricane Charley $ 31 $ $ 64 $ 95 $ $ 95 Hurricane Frances 22 6 65 93 5 98 Hurricane Ivan 40 20 71 131 5 136 Hurricane Jeanne 33 18 71 122 1 123 Typhoons 9 30 39 39 Other 8 8 8 Total $ 126 53 309 488 11 499 Reinstatement premiums (earned) expensed 13 13 (15 ) 11 11 Total impact before income tax 139 66 294 499 11 510 Income tax benefit (41 ) (21 ) (11 ) (73 ) (73 ) Total impact after income tax $ 98 $ 45 $ 283 $ 426 $ 11 $ 437 Effective tax rate 29% 32% 4% 15% 14% * Includes pre tax loss of $23 million related to deterioration in our initial estimates for the third quarter hurricanes. The above information is based on currently available information derived from modeling techniques, industry assessments of exposure and claims information obtained from our clients and brokers. Actual losses from these events may vary materially from our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties in making such determinations resulting from several factors, including the potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided by clients and brokers, the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques, as well as the high frequency of recent catastrophes and the effects of any resultant demand surge on claims activity. Sale of Financial and Mortgage Guaranty Business through Assured Guaranty Ltd. On April 28, 2004, we completed the sale of 65.3 percent of our financial and mortgage guaranty reinsurance and insurance businesses (transferred business) through the initial public offering (IPO) of 49 million common shares of Assured Guaranty Ltd. (Assured Guaranty) at $18.00 per share. Assured Guaranty was incorporated in Bermuda in August 2003 for the sole purpose of becoming a holding company for our transferred business. Pursuant to the completion of the IPO, we received proceeds, net of related offering costs, of approximately $835 million and a return of capital of $200 million from Assured Guaranty, which were used to support our property and casualty (P&C) business and strengthen our balance sheet capital position. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we accrued $5.4 million related to the 338(h)(10) tax election entered into with Assured Guaranty as part of the IPO transaction (as discussed below). This amount, net of tax, reduced the previously disclosed loss on sale and is recorded in realized gains (losses). Inclusive of the fourth quarter gain, the transaction resulted in a pre tax loss of $1.3 million, that reduces net realized gains in the consolidated statement of operations, and an after tax loss of $14.6 million. Additionally, in the second quarter we recognized compensation expense of $7.5 million in connection with the settlement of ACE stock awards held by the employees of Assured Guaranty. These expenses are reflected in Other (income) expense within the consolidated statement of operations. In conjunction with the IPO, our tax basis in the stock of Assured Guaranty and the tax basis of certain of Assured Guarantys tangible and intangible assets were increased to fair value. The increased tax basis should result in additional 31 Table of Contents tax deductions available to Assured Guaranty over a period of approximately 15 years. To the extent Assured Guaranty generates taxable income sufficient to realize the additional tax deductions, our tax sharing agreement with Assured Guaranty provides that it will be required to pay us the amount of tax savings actually realized, excluding the effect of any loss carrybacks. We do not recognize for accounting purposes the benefit of the savings associated with Assured Guarantys asset step up until the amounts are accruable, based on actual taxable income of the relevant Assured Guaranty entities due to the uncertainty of realization. Subsequent to the IPO, we beneficially own 26 million common shares, or 34.7 percent of Assured Guarantys outstanding common shares and accordingly, no longer consolidate our interest in the Assured Guaranty companies. Beginning April 29, 2004, we account for the retained interest under the equity method of accounting with the carrying value of our investment reflected in Investments in partially owned insurance companies within the consolidated balance sheet and our proportionate share of earnings reflected in Other (income) expense within the consolidated statement of operations. For segment reporting purposes, our proportionate share of earnings is reflected in our Financial Services segment. In connection with the IPO, we have entered into reinsurance agreements with Assured Guaranty in order to retain the insurance liabilities of certain run off businesses, including trade credit and residual value insurance. At their inception, these contracts had no effect on our net income. Additionally, we have entered into a number of agreements with Assured Guaranty that will govern certain aspects of the relationship after this offering, including service agreements under which we will provide certain services to Assured Guaranty for a period of time. See Note 4 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information pertaining to this transaction. Critical Accounting Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. While we believe that the amounts included in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: unpaid losses and loss expense reserves, including asbestos reserves; reinsurance recoverable, including our bad debt provision; impairments to the carrying value of our investment portfolio; the valuation of deferred tax assets; the fair value of certain derivatives; the valuation of goodwill; and assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts. We believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses, Asbestos and Environmental Claims, Reinsurance, Investments, Net Realized Gains (Losses) and Other Income and Expense Items. Unpaid losses and loss expenses As an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required, under GAAP, to establish loss reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR), and include estimates of expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. At December 31 2004, the unpaid losses and loss expense reserve was $31.5 billion. We do not discount our loss reserves, except for net loss and loss expense reserves of $157 million representing structured settlements for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable. The process of establishing reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change. We have actuarial staff in each of our operating segments who analyze insurance reserves and regularly evaluate the levels of loss reserves, taking into consideration factors that may impact the ultimate loss reserves. The potential for variation in loss reserves is impacted by numerous factors, which we explain below. 32 Table of Contents We estimate loss reserves for all of the insurance and reinsurance business that we write. In most cases, we do not have all the necessary information to determine the ultimate settlement value for a claim at the time we are required to accrue for the loss. As a result, historical experience and other statistical information are used to estimate the ultimate cost of the loss, depending on the type of business. To determine carried reserves for a particular line of business, we may perform one or more reserving methods to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses and use the results to select a single point estimate. These methods may include, but are not necessarily limited to, extrapolations of our historical reported and paid loss data, application of industry loss development patterns to our reported or paid losses, expected loss ratios developed by management, or historical industry loss ratios. Underlying judgments and assumptions that may be incorporated into these actuarial methods include, but are not necessarily limited to, adjustments to historical data used in models to exclude aberrations in claims data such as catastrophes that are typically analyzed separately, application of tail factors used to project ultimate claims from historical loss experience when there are several data points to use, adjustments to actuarial models and related data for known business changes, such as changes in claims covered under insurance contracts, and the effect of recent or pending litigation on future claim settlements. The process of determining a single best estimate by product, when more than one estimate is developed in the course of the actuarial review, may be performed in several ways. However, the objective of such process, which is consistently applied to all product lines, is to determine a single best estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other. Such estimate is viewed to support the most likely outcome of ultimate loss settlements and is determined based on several factors, including but not limited to, the extent of historical data and reliance on such data within the underlying reserve methodology, historical accuracy of loss estimates compared with actual loss experience for the product line or comparable product lines, and nature and extent of underlying assumptions. Depending on the facts and circumstances of each product line, the determination of a single best estimate may be accomplished by selecting a single point estimate when one estimate is determined to reflect a better estimate than the other point estimates or using a probability weighted average approach when more than one estimate is viewed to be reasonable. For example, an actuary may select loss reserves developed using an incurred loss development approach instead of a paid loss development approach as the best estimate when reported losses are viewed to be more credible indicators of ultimate loss estimates compared with paid losses. The actuaries evaluation process to determine a best estimate involves collaboration with underwriting, claims and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. Each reserve committee includes the participation of the business units actuary, financial management and executive management and has the responsibility for finalizing and approving the point estimate to be used as our best estimate. Reserves are further reviewed by ACEs Chief Actuary and senior management. We do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates for our individual loss reserve studies. Actuarial ranges are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between loss reserves estimated at the balance sheet date and the ultimate settlement of losses. This is due to the fact that an actuarial range is developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas actual volatility or prior period development has historically been reported in subsequent Consolidated Financial Statements, in part from events and circumstances that were unknown as of the original valuation date. We do believe, however, that while our recorded reserves are reasonable and represent managements best estimate for each individual study, based on known events, our total recorded loss reserves at December 31, 2004, are unlikely to vary by more than ten percent of the recorded amounts, either positively or negatively, based on actual claims emergence over the last several years, excluding A&E development. Historically, including A&E reserve charges, our reserves have developed in excess of ten percent of recorded amounts. See the Analysis of Losses and Loss Expense Development for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements. While we perform annual loss reserve studies for all product lines, the timing of such studies vary throughout the year. Additionally, for each product line, we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations used in reserving each quarter. If warranted from findings in loss emergence tests, we will accelerate the timing of our product line reserve studies. The Unpaid losses and loss expenses section below includes a discussion of our reserve setting procedures by segment. The following is discussion of specific reserving considerations by type of claim: Short tail business, such as property coverages Short tail business describes lines of business for which losses are usually known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs. This would include, for example, most property, personal accident, aviation hull and automobile physical damage policies that are written. Typically, there is less variability in reserve estimates for these lines of business. 33 Table of Contents Long tail business, such as casualty coverages Long tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known for some period and losses take much longer to emerge. This includes most casualty lines such as general liability, directors and officers liability (D&O) and workers compensation. There are many factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long tail business. Among these are: Given the recent expansion of this business, historical experience is often too immature to place reliance upon for reserving purposes. Instead, particularly for newer lines of business, reserve methods are based on industry loss ratios or development patterns that reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development. For new or growing lines of business, actual loss experience is apt to differ from industry loss statistics that are based on averages as well as loss experience of previous underwriting years; The inherent uncertainty of the length of paid and reporting development patterns; The possibility of future litigation, legislative or judicial change that might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience relied upon in loss reserve analyses; Loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner. If data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics, such as loss payment patterns, the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected. Because casualty lines of business can have various intricacies in their underlying coverage, there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses. At December 31, 2004, approximately 74 percent, or $12.7 billion of our net reserves (68 percent excluding A&E reserves) relate to long tail business. The estimation of unpaid losses and loss expense reserves can also be affected by the layer at which a particular contract or set of contracts is written. In the case of direct insurance, where the insurer is taking on risk in the lower value end of the particular contract, the experience will tend to be more frequency driven. These lines of business allow for more traditional actuarial methods to be used in determining loss reserve levels, as it is customary to have more historical experience to rely upon. In the case of excess of loss contracts, the experience will tend to be more of a severity nature, as only a significant loss will enter the layer. For structured or unique contracts, most common to the financial solutions business and to a lesser extent our reinsurance business, traditional actuarial methods for setting loss reserves (such as loss development triangles), have to be tempered with an analysis of each contracts terms, original pricing information, subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts, market exposures and history, and qualitative input from claims managers. Asbestos and Environmental Reserves (A&E) Included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are liabilities for asbestos, environmental and latent injury damage claims and expenses (A&E). These claims are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards. The estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment, including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims. In January 2005, we announced net additions to our A&E and other run off reserves of $364 million exclusive of the provision for bad debts of $95 million. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $453 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. In addition, ACE Overseas General had gross and net A&E additions of $6 million resulting in a total A&E charge of $459 million for 2004. Our A&E reserves, and our range of estimates are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated changes in the legal, social or economic environment, or any benefit from future legislative reforms. Accordingly, our A&E reserves make no allowance for future state or federal asbestos reforms, such as those currently being contemplated. The majority of our reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2004 arose with the strengthening of a core group of major accounts impacted by changes in the asbestos industry landscape. In particular, our estimates of future liability were impacted by the continued negative effect of bankruptcies and an increase in defense costs to litigate cases. There are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome. We believe the most significant variables relating to our A&E reserves include assumptions regarding multiple recoveries by claimants against various defendants; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non products coverage; whether high level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholders claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants and the potential liability of peripheral defendants. Based on the policies, the facts, the law and a careful analysis of the impact that these risk factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs and coverage litigation expense. 34 Table of Contents The results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carrier, policyholder and claimants. Additional information on A&E can be found in the section entitled, Asbestos and Environmental Claims and other Run off Liabilities. Reinsurance recoverable Reinsurance recoverable includes the balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses, based on contracts in force, and are presented net of a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors. We determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts. The recognition of reinsurance recoverable requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves our estimation of the amount of gross IBNR to be ceded to reinsurers. Ceded IBNR is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (see Critical Accounting Estimate Unpaid losses and loss expenses). The second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we will ultimately be unable to recover from related reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Amounts estimated to be uncollectible are reflected in a bad debt provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable balance and shareholders equity. Changes in the bad debt provision are reflected in net income. At December 31, 2004, the reinsurance recoverable balance includes $15 billion of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, less a provision for bad debts of $619 million. The net unpaid recoverables consist of ceded IBNR of $7.9 billion and ceded case reserves of $6.0 billion. Also included are $1.2 billion of reinsurance recoverable on paid loss and loss adjustment expenses, less a provision for bad debts of $309 million. Although the contractual obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectibility of such amounts requires significant estimation by management. The majority of the balance we have accrued as recoverable will not be due for collection until sometime in the future (in some cases several decades from now). Over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us. To estimate the bad debt provision, the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer. This determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. As part of this process, ceded IBNR is allocated by reinsurance agreement, and then by reinsurer, because ceded IBNR is not generally calculated on an agreement by agreement basis. The allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements, as adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. If actual experience varies materially from historical experience, including that used to determine ceded premium, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will change. While such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the bad debt provision, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded. Generally, we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurers balance deemed uncollectible. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. The more significant considerations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: historical industry default statistics for the reinsurers current ratings class, the actual collection experience of the reinsurer, collateral triggers or other contractual provisions that may mitigate default exposure, and the dates the balances will likely become due (duration). For recoverable balances considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), management generally applies industry default factors consistent with the reinsurers particular rating class. Such factors have been developed by a major ratings agency; for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent, affiliate, peer company, or internal analysis, addi 35 Table of Contents tional judgment is required to determine a reasonable default factor. Such default factors are based on either an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate; and for insolvent insurers, management develops default factors based on an evaluation of each of the insolvent entities. At December 31, 2004, the use of different assumptions within the model could have a material effect on the bad debt provision reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our bad debt provision. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. Given the various considerations used to develop default factors, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the bad debt provision. However, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at December 31, 2004, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of all rated reinsurers could increase our bad debt provision by as much as 15 percent, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. While a rating downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for bad debt and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will not ultimately collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. Additional information on reinsurance recoverable can be found in the section entitled, Reinsurance. Investments Consistent with an available for sale designation, we report all investments in our portfolio at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in shareholders equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Fair value is determined using the quoted market price of these securities provided by either independent pricing services, or when such prices are not available, by reference to broker or underwriter bid indications. We regularly review our impaired investments (i.e., those debt securities in which fair value is below amortized cost or those equity securities in which fair value is below cost) for a possible other than temporary impairment. If we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, we record the decline as an unrealized loss in our shareholders equity. If we believe the decline is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a realized loss in our consolidated statement of operations. An impairment is considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment to recovery of fair value up to the cost of the investment, and evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period outweighs evidence to the contrary. The determination as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary principally requires the following critical judgments: i) the circumstances that require management to make a specific assessment as to whether or not the decline is other than temporary, such as the time period an investment has been in a loss position and the significance of the decline; and ii) for those securities to be assessed, whether we have the ability and intent to hold the security through an expected recovery period, absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse effect on either the financial markets or the financial position of the issuer. With respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the securitys value is not written down, a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss. Subsequent decisions on security sales could be made based on changes in liquidity needs (i.e., arising from a large insured loss such as a catastrophe), internal risk management considerations, the financial condition of the issuer or its industry, market conditions, and new investment opportunities. Day to day management of the majority of our investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers. While these investment managers may, at a given point in time, believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses until such losses are recovered, the dynamic nature of portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss based upon new circumstances such as those related to the changes described above. We believe that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of our portfolio as available for sale. The gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2004, for all securities in a loss position was $72 million. Because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders equity, adverse changes in economic conditions subsequent to the balance sheet date could result in other than temporary impairments that are material to our financial condition and operating results. Such economic changes could arise from overall changes in the financial markets or specific changes to industries, companies, or foreign governments in which we maintain relatively large investment holdings. More information regarding our process for reviewing our portfolio for possible impairments can be found in the section entitled Net Realized Gains (Losses). 36 Table of Contents Our exposure to interest rate risk is concentrated in our fixed income portfolio. An increase in interest rates of 50 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve would have resulted in a decrease in the market value of the fixed income portfolio of approximately $400 million at December 31, 2004. An immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario. Deferred tax assets Many of our insurance businesses operate in income tax paying jurisdictions. We provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). Our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. At December 31, 2004, our net deferred tax asset was $1.2 billion, including $228 million relating to net operating loss carryforwards of $652 million, which will expire in the years 2021 2022 and foreign tax credits of $431 million of which $50 million will expire in the years 2011 2014. The remaining $381 million of foreign tax credits are currently deferred. (See Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). Based on our current expectations of future taxable income we estimate that we will utilize all net operating loss carryforwards within the next one to two years. At each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction, principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies. Projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. If, in the future, our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax paying component proves to be incorrect, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. At December 31, 2004, the valuation allowance of $89.6 million (including $28.5 million with respect to foreign tax credits) reflects managements assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income or the inability to utilize foreign tax credits. Derivatives FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (FAS 133) establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. FAS 133 requires that all derivatives be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in our net income. We maintain investments in derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts primarily to manage duration and foreign currency exposure, enhance our portfolio yield or obtain an exposure to a particular financial market. In addition, as part of our investing activities, we purchase to be announced mortgage backed securities (TBAs), which we treat as derivatives for reporting purposes. Open derivatives as of the balance sheet date are reported at fair value based on market quotes or valuations provided to us by third party investment managers using market data. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used for investment purposes are reflected in net realized gains (losses). Certain products we sell have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. These products are accounted for at fair value and consist of GMIB reinsurance in our life operation and credit default swaps principally through our ownership interest in Assured Guaranty. We believe that the most meaningful presentation of these derivatives is to reflect cash inflows or revenue as net premiums earned, and to record estimates of future cash outflows as incurred losses. For both GMIB reinsurance and credit default swaps, when we determine that a future cash payment is probable, we establish reserves for the loss. Other components of fair value are reflected in other assets or other liabilities in the balance sheet and related changes reflected in net realized gains (losses) in the income statement. We generally hold these derivative contracts to maturity. Where we hold a derivative to maturity, the cumulative unrealized gains and losses will net to zero if we incur no credit losses on that contract. (See Note 2(o) of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information) The fair value of these instruments depends on a number of factors including changes in interest rates, changes in equity markets, changes in credit markets and for GMIB reinsurance, changes in the allocation of investments underlying annuitant account value. Where available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of these instruments. 37 Table of Contents If the quoted prices are not available, the fair value is estimated using valuation models for each type of instrument. These models may be developed by third parties, such as rating agencies, or internally based on market conventions for similar transactions, depending on the circumstances. These models and related assumptions are continuously reevaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely market information, such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities. Refer to Item 7A of the Form 10 K/A for a more detailed discussion of the sensitivity of our GMIB products to market factors. Valuation models include the use of management estimates and current market information. Management is also required to make assumptions on how the fair value of derivative instruments is affected by current market conditions. Management considers factors such as current prices charged for similar agreements, performance of underlying assets, and our ability to obtain reinsurance for our insured obligations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products, actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the differences may be material. Fair value adjustments attributed to derivative transactions are included in our net realized gains (losses). We recorded a loss of $13 million and a gain of $176 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, the change in fair value was related to many factors, including a loss of approximately $25 million related to the reversal of unrealized gains upon the termination of several credit default swaps and the sale of Assured Guaranty. The credit default swaps covered the equity layer of synthetic CDOs written by our financial solutions business. The unrealized losses were generally offset by increases in net premiums earned. In addition, net realized gains of $10 million were reported for GMIB reinsurance in 2004. In addition, in past years, we had entered into a few other, relatively illiquid, index based derivative instruments that were reported at fair value. These instruments were principally linked to equity and real estate market indices. The determination of fair value for these derivatives required considerable judgement as there was limited ability to trade the contracts, since they were uniquely structured and the exposure period covered up to 30 years. In early 2004, these contracts were terminated at a gain in conjunction with the sale of Assured Guaranty. Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the cost of our acquisitions over the tangible net assets we acquired, was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2004. The ACE INA acquisition comprises approximately 80 percent of this balance. FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, primarily addresses accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Pursuant to FAS 142, goodwill is not amortized to income but instead, is subject to a periodic evaluation of impairment. It is our policy to test goodwill as well as other intangible assets for other than temporary impairments on an annual basis. At January 1, 2002, the initial adoption date of FAS 142, January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2004, goodwill was assigned to the applicable reporting units of the acquired entities giving rise to goodwill. Our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing are primarily based on legal entities within our operating segments. The allocation of goodwill to these reporting units is consistent with goodwill recognized at acquisition. In effect, impairment tests are performed for each acquired entity giving rise to goodwill. The most significant reporting units are the domestic and international divisions of ACE INA, which were acquired in 1999; ACE Tempest Re acquired in 1996; and Tarquin Limited acquired in 1998. There are other reporting units that resulted from smaller acquisitions, that are also assessed annually. The transitional impairment test of goodwill determined that there was no impairment in goodwill in 2002. In our impairment tests, we principally use both an earnings model, that includes relevant financial data of comparable companies to the reporting unit being tested, such as the relationship of price to book value for recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies, and an estimation of fair value based on present value of estimated net cash flows. We must assess whether the current fair value of our operating units is at least equal to the fair value used in the determination of goodwill. In doing this, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our operating segments, as this is important in assessing whether an impairment has occurred. As part of our ongoing management assessments, we regularly analyze our operating companies in an effort to maximize future cash flows and profitability. For 2004, we recorded a goodwill impairment of $13 million primarily as a result of a review conducted during the first quarter which led to a write down of goodwill relating to our Lloyds life syndicate. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $6 million in 2003, due to updated forecasts which supported indications that two relatively small majority owned companies would not achieve sufficient contract sales volumes to generate and sustain future profitable results. If, in the future, our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities prove to be incorrect, goodwill carried on our balance sheet could be materially overstated. This would cause us to write down the carrying value of goodwill, resulting in a charge to earnings in the period recorded. Accordingly, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period the charge is taken. 38 Table of Contents In 2002, we purchased approximately 22 percent of a Chinese insurance company, Huatai Insurance Company (Huatai). We account for our ownership interest in Huatai under the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2004, our carrying value for this investment is approximately $147 million, which includes goodwill of approximately $97 million. To date, Huatais product offerings have focused on P&C insurance; however, Huatai intends to commence selling life and asset accumulation products in 2005. Based on Huatais current business plan and the current state of the Chinese insurance market, we have determined that our investment in Huatai is not impaired at December 31, 2004. Risk transfer In the ordinary course of business, we both purchase, or cede, and sell, or assume, P&C reinsurance protection. For both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements as per FAS No. 113, Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short Duration and Long Duration Contracts (FAS 113), must be met in order to obtain reinsurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premium and losses. If risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. We also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit. Contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment. Reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. For such contracts, often referred to as finite or structured products, we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception. To support risk transfer, the cash flow analyses must support the fact that a significant loss is reasonably possible, such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds 110 percent. For purposes of cash flow analyses, we generally use a risk free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments. In addition, to support insurance risk, we must prove the reinsurers risk of loss varies consistently with that of the reinsured and or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss. To ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed, quantitative risk transfer analyses and memos supporting risk transfer must be developed by underwriters for all structured products. Furthermore, throughout 2004, such assessments were reviewed and approved by Corporate Accounting. Beginning in December 2004, we formed a Structured Transaction Review Committee that has the responsibility of both reviewing risk transfer assessments and other relevant accounting matters for our structured products as well as certain underwriting criteria specific to structured or finite products. With respect to ceded reinsurance, we have entered into a few multi year excess of loss retrospectively rated contracts, principally in 2002, that provide coverage during 2004 and 2003. These contracts principally provide severity protection for specific product divisions. Because traditional one year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly, these contracts were generally entered into to secure a more cost effective reinsurance program. All of these contracts transferred risk and have been accounted for as reinsurance. In addition, we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to 2003, such as the National Indemnity Company (NICO) contracts referred to in the section entitled, Asbestos and Environmental Claims. In 2002, we commenced a policy to discontinue the purchase of all finite reinsurance contracts, at both the corporate and product division level. Subsequent to the acquisition of CIGNA P&C, we have not purchased any retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts. With respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts, products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer are primarily sold by our financial solutions businesses, included in our Financial Services segment. Such products principally include multi year retrospectively rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers. Because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products, relatively few P&C insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met. For certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits, the insured desired to self insure a risk but was required, legally or otherwise, to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non payment from the insured. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 The discussions that follow include tables, which show both our consolidated and segment operating results for the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. In presenting our segment operating results, we have discussed our performance with reference to underwriting results, which is a non GAAP measure. We consider this measure, which may be defined differently by other companies, to be important in understanding our overall results of operations. Underwriting results are calculated by subtracting losses and loss expenses, life and annuity benefits, policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses from net premiums earned. We use underwriting results and operating ratios to monitor the results of our operations without the impact of certain factors, including net investment income, other (income) expense, interest and income tax expense and net realized gains (losses). We believe the use of these measures enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business. Underwriting results should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP.  Consolidated Operating Results (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Net premiums written $ 11,496 $ 10,268 $ 8,159 Net premiums earned 11,110 9,727 6,904 Net investment income 1,013 900 812 Net realized gains (loss) 197 265 (489 ) Total revenues $ 12,320 $ 10,892 $ 7,227 Losses and loss expenses 7,693 6,168 4,973 Life and annuity benefits 172 181 158 Policy acquisition costs 1,565 1,350 960 Administrative expenses 1,265 1,189 919 Interest expense 183 177 193 Other expense 3 34 36 Total expenses $ 10,881 $ 9,099 $ 7,239 Income (loss) before income tax 1,439 1,793 (12 ) Income tax expense (benefit) 286 311 (112 ) Net income $ 1,153 $ 1,482 $ 100 Net premiums written, which reflect the premiums we retain after purchasing reinsurance protection, increased 12 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. This increase was driven by P&C net premiums written growth of 22 percent, partially offset by a 69 percent decline in net premiums written in our Financial Services segment. Adjusting for the appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, net premiums written in our P&C business increased 18 percent in 2004. The increase in our P&C business was primarily a result of growth in property and casualty business due to broader market presence, and growth in personal accident business. In addition, our P&C retention ratio (the ratio of net premiums written to gross premiums written) increased to 71 percent in 2004, compared with 70 percent in 2003. Such increases were partially offset by a decline in net premiums written in our Financial Services business, primarily due to the de consolidation of Assured Guaranty beginning April 28, 2004 (subsequent to the IPO). Net premiums written increased 26 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, due to growth in P&C gross premiums written and increased retention. 40 Table of Contents The following table provides a consolidated breakdown of net premiums earned by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars)(Restated) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 3,397 31% $ 3,033 31% $ 2,187 32% Casualty 5,840 52% 4,503 46% 2,780 40% Personal Accident (A&H) 1,133 10% 920 10% 701 10% Total P&C 10,370 93% 8,456 87% 5,668 82% Global Re life 220 2% 184 2% 158 2% Financial Services 520 5% 1,087 11% 1,078 16% Net premiums earned $ 11,110 100% $ 9,727 100% $ 6,904 100% Net premiums earned reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure period expires. Net premiums earned in our P&C business increased 23 percent (21 percent, adjusting for foreign exchange) in 2004, respectively, compared with 2003. Our Financial Services business reported a decrease in net premiums earned of 52 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The change in net premiums earned for both the P&C and Financial Services businesses is consistent with the trend in net premiums written. Net premiums earned increased 41 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, consistent with the increase in net premiums written. Net investment income increased 12 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase in net investment income is primarily due to positive operating cash flows, which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base. The sale of Assured Guaranty during 2004 had the effect of reducing the average invested asset base for Financial Services, which resulted in lower net investment income for that segment. Net investment income increased 11 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, also due to the higher average invested asset base. In evaluating our P&C and Financial Services businesses we use the combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio. We calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. We do not calculate these ratios for the life reinsurance business as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that business. The combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio. A combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting losses. The following table shows our consolidated loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition ratio, administrative expense ratio and combined ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Loss and loss expense ratio 70.6% 64.6% 73.7% Policy acquisition cost ratio 14.2% 14.0% 14.0% Administrative expense ratio 11.6% 12.4% 13.5% Combined ratio 96.4% 91.0% 101.2% Our loss and loss expense ratio increased six percentage points in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses and A&E reserve strengthening, both recorded in the second half of the year. Partially offsetting the impact of these charges, we experienced less net adverse prior period development in 2004, compared with 2003. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, A&E reserve strengthening and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 70.6% 64.6% 73.7% Catastrophe losses 4.5% 1.2% 2.3% A&E reserve strengthening 4.2% 7.6% Adverse prior period development 1.0% 1.7% 3.1% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 60.9% 61.7% 60.7% 41 Table of Contents We recorded $499 million in catastrophe losses in 2004, compared with $112 million and $156 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a net increase in A&E and other run off reserves of $465 million. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $554 million including the provision for bad debts of $95 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. In 2002, net A&E reserves were increased by $516 million. Our loss and loss expense ratio is also impacted by prior period development. Prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years. For purposes of analysis and disclosure, management views prior period development to be changes in the nominal value of loss estimates from period to period and excludes changes in loss estimates that do not arise from the emergence of claims, such as those related to uncollectible reinsurance, interest, or foreign currency. Accordingly, specific items excluded from prior period development include the following: gains/losses related to foreign currency translation that affect both the valuation of unpaid losses and loss expenses and losses incurred; losses recognized from the early termination or commutation of reinsurance agreements that principally relate to the time value of money; changes in the value of reinsurance business assumed reflected in losses incurred but principally related to the time value of money and losses that arise from changes in estimates of earned premiums from prior accident years. We experienced net adverse prior period development excluding A&E of $82 million in 2004, compared with net adverse prior period development of $174 million and $211 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our Segment Operating Results, below, contain further detail of the prior period development recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our losses and loss expenses for 2004 also include $8 million in connection with the commutation of ceded reinsurance contracts that resulted from a differential between consideration received from reinsurers and the related reduction of reinsurance recoverables, principally related to the time value of money. Due to our initiatives to reduce reinsurance recoverable balances and thereby encourage such commutations, losses recognized in connection with the commutation of ceded reinsurance contracts in 2004 and thereafter are not considered when assessing segment performance and accordingly, are directly allocated to the Corporate segment. Additionally, we do not consider the development of loss reserves related to the September 11 tragedy (WTC) in assessing segment performance as these loss reserves are managed by Corporate. Accordingly, the effect of related loss reserve development either positively or negatively on net income is reported within the Corporate segment. During the fourth quarter of 2004, certain adjustments were made to these loss reserves; however, there was no net loss reserve development on a consolidated basis. Although the Corporate segment reported no net loss development, it incurred a tax benefit of $14 million from these adjustments since loss reserves developed adversely in taxable jurisdictions, thereby resulting in a tax benefit, but favorably in non taxable jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2004, gross and net unpaid losses related to WTC amounted to $756 million and $273 million, respectively. The remaining decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio for 2004 was primarily the result of favorable current accident year experience on property business of approximately $140 million. Partially offsetting this decrease were changes in business mix in our Global Reinsurance and Insurance North American segments. Global Reinsurance has been growing its non catastrophe P&C lines while Insurance North American has been increasing its participation in casualty lines. See the section entitled Segment Operating Results for more information. Our policy acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes, underwriting and other costs that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of premium. The policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2004 compared with 2003 and 2002. For 2004 and 2003, our policy acquisition costs include commission expenses related to Policy Service Agreements (PSAs) of $53 million and $61 million, respectively. Our administrative expense ratios have declined over the last three years due to the favorable impact of expense reduction initiatives which commenced in 2003 and continued into 2004. Administrative expenses in 2004 were negatively impacted by costs associated with compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act and by legal expenses incurred in connection with the AG investigations. Interest expense increased slightly in 2004 due to our issuance of $500 million of ACE INA 5.875 percent senior notes during the second quarter, partially offset by our repayment of the $400 million of ACE INA 8.2 percent notes in the third quarter. Interest expense declined in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to a reduction in average outstanding trust preferred securities. Other (income) expense includes equity in net income of subsidiary from Assured Guaranty see the section entitled Other Income and Expense for more information. Our effective tax rate on net income was 20 percent in 2004, compared with 16 percent in 2003. This is primarily a result of incurring the majority of the 2004 catastrophe charges in lower tax jurisdictions, causing our net income to decline without a commensurate decrease in income tax expense. Additionally, in 2004, we incurred approximately $13 42 Table of Contents million in income tax expense related to federal income taxes from the transfer of our U.S. financial and mortgage guaranty operations to Assured Guaranty and attributed to the sale of our Assured Guaranty shares. The A&E reserve strengthening resulted in tax benefits of $163 million in 2004, which partially reduced our overall effective tax rate on net income. Our effective tax rate is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates; a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective tax rate. The income tax benefit in 2002, relates primarily to the A&E reserve strengthening in that year. Net income declined 22 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses and A&E reserve strengthening. The appreciation of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar added $43 million to our net income in 2004. Net income increased significantly in 2003, compared with 2002, which was negatively impacted by A&E reserve strengthening. Segment Operating Results Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 Insurance North American The Insurance North American segment comprises our P&C insurance operations in the U.S., Bermuda and Canada. This segment writes a variety of insurance products including property, casualty (general liability, workers compensation, risk management, professional lines (directors and officers (D&O) and errors and omissions coverages (E&O)), marine, program business, aerospace, consumer oriented products, specialty lines and accident and health (A&H) principally being personal accident.

The increase relates primarily to growth in casualty business, which increased 32 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. We have been increasing our participation in the casualty market in order to take advantage of more favorable market conditions (relative to property lines). In recent quarters, we have noted that although rates, terms and conditions continue to produce adequate returns, the growth in casualty premiums has begun to slow due to increased competitive conditions. Despite the softening market conditions, we reported robust growth on the strength of broader market presence, increased product offerings and higher submission flows. In addition, we have been increasing our retention of business due to the improving risk profile of our underlying business and our increasing capital base. Insurance North Americans retention ratio increased to 63 percent in 2004, compared with 59 percent in 2003, resulting in additional net premiums written of $307 million. Net premiums written for Insurance North American increased 39 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to increased retention of gross premiums written. 43 Table of Contents The following two tables provide a line of business and entity/divisional breakdown of Insurance North Americans net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars)(Restated) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 1,279 27% $ 1,102 29% $ 947 38% Casualty 3,226 69% 2,446 67% 1,445 59% Personal Accident (A&H) 174 4% 141 4% 85 3% Net premiums earned $ 4,679 100% $ 3,689 100% $ 2,477 100% (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) ACE USA $ 3,011 $ 2,216 $ 1,399 ACE Westchester Specialty 1,242 1,061 819 ACE Bermuda 426 412 259 Net premiums earned $ 4,679 $ 3,689 $ 2,477 ACE USA, which includes ACE operations in Canada, provides a broad array of products and services to corporate and consumer clients throughout the U.S. and Canada, primarily through licensed insurance companies. Distribution channels include retail brokers, agents, managing general agents, and managing general underwriters. ACE USAs net premiums earned increased 36 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to growth experienced in the casualty lines in 2003 and early 2004. ACE USA reported solid growth in risk management and excess workers compensation (primarily high deductible policies in national accounts business) due to new business, rate increases and higher retention. ACE USA also experienced strong demand for specialty products such as small business workers compensation coverage and umbrella, excess coverage as well as liability, professional liability (mainly D&O), environmental, commercial surety and medical coverages. The current years growth in net premiums earned has outpaced the growth of net premiums written, reflecting the launch of new products first offered in late 2003, expanded distribution and the more favorable rate environment experienced in 2003. ACE USA reported an increase in net premiums earned of 59 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to higher rates and increased volume of P&C business, especially on casualty lines. ACE Westchester Specialty specializes in the wholesale distribution of excess and surplus lines property, inland marine and casualty coverage and products. ACE Westchester Specialty also provides coverage for agriculture business and specialty programs through its Program division. ACE Westchester Specialtys net premiums earned increased 17 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. This increase primarily reflects higher casualty writings as well as increased agriculture coverage, reflecting growth in new business. ACE Westchester Specialtys net premiums earned for 2003 increased 30 percent, compared with 2002. This increase was primarily due to higher casualty writings and growth in agriculture business. ACE Bermuda, which specializes in providing professional lines and excess liability coverage, reported stable net premiums earned in 2004, compared with 2003, as increased capacity has fueled competition, and a decline in rates on professional lines and excess property business. ACE Bermuda reported an increase in net premiums earned of 57 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily on the strength of higher renewal rates and increased volume of new business across most of its product offerings. Insurance North Americans loss and loss expense ratio increased 14.4 percentage points in 2004, compared with 2003. This increase was primarily due to the A&E reserve strengthening, increased catastrophe losses and prior period development. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, A&E reserve strengthening and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 83.3% 68.9% 89.7% Catastrophe losses 2.7% 0.5% A&E reserve strengthening 9.8% 20.8% Adverse prior period development 4.2% 2.5% 3.2% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 66.6% 65.9% 65.7% 44 Table of Contents Our catastrophe losses for 2004 were $126 million, compared with catastrophe losses of $20 million in 2003. The 2004 loss and loss expense ratio was negatively impacted by the A&E and other run off reserve strengthening, which resulted in a before tax charge of $459 million, including the provision for bad debts, for Insurance North American. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $548 million including the provision for bad debts of $95 million and favorable prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. We also experienced $195 million of net adverse prior period development in 2004, representing 2.9 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net adverse prior period development of $103 million, representing 1.6 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 prior period development was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements, the most significant of which were: Adverse development of $98 million (accident years 2002 and prior) on the ACE Bermuda high excess professional lines business book due to updated information received for a few known claims with U.S. exposures. Adverse development of $298 million in our domestic U.S. run off operations following completion of reserve studies that reflected higher than anticipated actual loss experience. In particular; Workers compensation business (approximately $163 million across accident years 2001 and prior) on several blocks of business including middle market and excess policies, particularly related to a higher severity of claims relative to original expectations arising from various sources such as continued medical inflation and higher allocated claims expense costs. To respond to these trends, for certain workers compensation portfolios, a detailed claims audit was performed on a number of our larger blocks of worker compensation business and the latest actuarial studies segregated the claims data into finer components. The result of these efforts was a more detailed and refined analysis which included changes in loss development factors and tail factor selections, and led to the increases in our estimates of ultimate losses during 2004. General liability business (approximately $60 million across accident years 2002 and prior) on various books of business including primary and excess casualty. This development was principally the result of an increase in the frequency of claims reported relative to initial expectations. Open market facility writing specialty business ($28 million across accident years 1998 2002). Aviation business ($27 million in accident years 2003 and prior) primarily related to adverse case reserve development. Miscellaneous professional liability business ($20 million in accident years 2000 and prior). Favorable development of $181 million on lines with short tail exposures (i.e. property and marine) principally related to accident years 2003 and, to a lesser extent, 2002. Such favorable development was the result of lower claims emergence relative to prior years. The 2003 net adverse prior period development was related to casualty lines as adverse prior period development of $74 million was experienced in professional liability, reinsurance of long term disability and run off business and $46 million arising from an increase in medical inflation on run off workers compensation affecting accident years 1997 2000. This adverse prior period development was partially offset by $28 million of favorable prior period development on property, excess liability and marine lines of business. Net adverse prior period development of $85 million was incurred in 2002, primarily from run off business with the remainder being attributed to several lines of business including workers compensation, commercial automobile, health care asset management run off, warranty and financial institutions business. The remaining increase in the loss and loss expense ratio in the three years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, was principally the result of casualty lines comprising a higher proportion of net premiums earned. Due to their longer claim pay out duration, casualty lines exhibit a higher loss and loss expense ratio relative to other types of business. The impact of the increasing proportion of casualty business on the loss ratio was partially offset by favorable current accident year experience of $35 million on property business. Administrative expenses increased in 2004 and 2003, primarily due to increased staffing costs (primarily underwriting and support unit personnel) and technology spending, related to servicing the growth in Insurance North Americans product lines. The administrative expense ratio declined in 2004 and 2003, due to an increase in net premiums earned that outpaced the growth in expenses. The policy acquisition ratio for 2003 increased due to our decision to increase our retention ratio by purchasing less reinsurance, which resulted in reduced ceding commissions for Insurance North American. 45 Table of Contents Insurance Overseas General The Insurance Overseas General segment comprises ACE International, our network of indigenous insurance operations, and the insurance operations of ACE Global Markets, our excess and suplus lines writer (which underwrites P&C insurance through Lloyds Syndicate 2488 and ACE European Group Limited (formerly known as ACE INA UK Limited)). The Insurance Overseas General segment writes a variety of insurance products including property, casualty consisting of general liability, professional lines (D&O and E&O), marine, energy, aviation, political risk, consumer oriented products and A&H principally being personal accident. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, Segment Information, under Item 1. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Net premiums written $ 4,341 $ 3,776 $ 2,855 Net premiums earned 4,302 3,662 2,514 Losses and loss expenses 2,426 2,183 1,535 Policy acquisition costs 802 682 533 Administrative expenses 551 490 381 Underwriting income $ 523 $ 307 $ 65 Net investment income 224 166 113 Net realized gains (losses) 47 (6 ) (37 ) Interest expense 1 Other (income) expense 25 15 14 Income tax expense (benefit) 230 98 2 Net income $ 539 $ 354 $ 124 Loss and loss expense ratio 56.4% 59.6% 61.1% Policy acquisition cost ratio 18.7% 18.6% 21.2% Administrative expense ratio 12.8% 13.4% 15.2% Combined ratio 87.9% 91.6% 97.5% Insurance Overseas Generals net premiums written increased 15 percent in 2004 (8 percent adjusting for foreign exchange), compared with 2003, principally due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and the Euro and also due to growth across most regions for ACE International. Additionally, the retention ratio for Insurance Overseas General increased to 74 percent in 2004, compared with 73 percent in 2003. This increase in retention added $65 million to net premiums written in 2004. Net premiums written increased 32 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, due to rate increases, new business and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. ACE Internationals P&C operations are organized geographically and along product lines. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage as well as energy industry related coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial general liability and liability coverage for multinational organizations. Through our professional lines, we provide D&O and professional indemnity coverages for medium to large clients. The A&H insurance operations provide principally accident coverage to individuals and groups outside of U.S. insurance markets. In 2004, ACE International recorded an increase in net premiums written of 22 percent (11 percent adjusting for foreign exchange) to $3.2 billion. ACE Internationals increase in net premiums written was primarily driven by ACE Europe and ACE Asia Pacific, as both regions reported strong growth in P&C and A&H lines, mainly due to new business recorded in the first three quarters of the year. More recently, we have seen increased competitive conditions in Europe and the U.K. which have resulted in rates being flat or lower for ACE Europes P&C and A&H lines. ACE Latin America reported growth in A&H business. ACE Internationals net premiums written increased 38 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, due to rate increases, new business and the weakening of the U.S. dollar. ACE Global Markets main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, political risk and A&H. ACE Global Markets net premiums written increased three percent to $1.1 billion in 2004 (unchanged, adjusting for foreign exchange). ACE Global Markets net premiums written increased 40 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to rate increases, increased retention of gross premiums written and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. 46 Table of Contents The following two tables provide a line of business and entity/divisional breakdown of Insurance Overseas Generals net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) (Restated) 2004 % of total 2003 % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 1,416 33% $ 1,224 33% $ 758 30% Casualty 1,928 45% 1,659 46% 1,140 45% Personal Accident (A&H) 958 22% 779 21% 616 25% Net premiums earned $ 4,302 100% $ 3,662 100% $ 2,514 100% (in millions of U.S. dollars) (Restated) 2004 2003 2002 ACE Europe $ 1,934 $ 1,466 $ 925 ACE Asia Pacific 491 390 246 ACE Far East 382 367 335 ACE Latin America 355 297 225 ACE International 3,162 2,520 1,731 ACE Global Markets 1,140 1,142 783 Net premiums earned $ 4,302 $ 3,662 $ 2,514 Insurance Overseas General increased net premiums earned 17 percent in 2004, compared with 2003 (13 percent adjusting for foreign exchange). Consistent with the trend in net premiums written, the major driver of growth was ACE Europe which contributed close to 73 percent of Insurance Overseas Generals increase in net premiums earned in 2004. ACE Europe has been experiencing several quarters of increased production across most of its product offerings and has also been bolstered by the appreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Net premiums earned increased 47 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, principally due to new business, higher rates and the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Insurance Overseas Generals loss and loss expense ratio decreased 3.2 percentage points in 2004, primarily due to favorable current accident year experience on property business, which amounted to $95 million. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses, and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 56.4% 59.6% 61.1% Catastrophe losses 1.2% 0.3% 2.7% Adverse prior period development 0.3% 1.5% 4.1% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 54.9% 57.8% 54.3% Catastrophe losses for 2004 were $53 million, compared with $10 million and $68 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively. We experienced $17 million of net favorable prior period development in 2004 (including $6 million relating to A&E reserve strengthening), representing 0.2 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net adverse prior period development of $55 million, representing 2.3 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 prior period development was the net result of several underlying favorable and adverse movements, the most significant of which were: Favorable development of $103 million on short tail property and fire lines (primarily accident year 2003 and to a lesser extent 2002) primarily due to the emergence of favorable loss experience, mostly at ACE Europe and ACE Asia Pacific. Adverse development of $42 million on aviation business as a result of a lengthening of development patterns used in loss reserving analysis driven by recent claims emergence. Adverse development of $28 million on casualty lines due to changes in actuarial reserving assumptions and in particular those to derive allocated loss adjustment expense reserves, following detailed actuarial review. Adverse development of $12 million on political risk due to adverse loss experience most notably on expropriation and repayment default claims in Argentina. 47 Table of Contents Adverse development of $10 million on A&H, primarily driven by continued poor experience on Norwegian occupational injury (primarily accident years 2001 2003). Adverse development of $10 million on run off retrocessional business following review of individual treaties. The 2003 net adverse prior period development was driven by $54 million of adverse prior period development on specialty lines, including marine and satellite and also $38 million on casualty lines related to the lengthening of development patterns. This adverse prior period development was partially offset by $47 million of favorable loss experience on short tail property and fire lines. Net adverse prior period development of $116 million was incurred in 2002, primarily related to casualty and D&O lines for ACE International and aerospace business for ACE Global Markets. The policy acquisition cost ratio for Insurance Overseas General was stable in 2004, compared with 2003. Insurance Overseas Generals administrative expenses increased 12 percent in 2004, primarily due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and increased staff costs at ACE Europe and ACE Asia Pacific. The administrative expense ratio for Insurance Overseas General improved due to the increase in net premiums earned coupled with a reduction in Lloyds charges within ACE Global Markets. In 2003, the policy acquisition ratio declined compared with 2002, primarily due to changes in business mix. Administrative expenses increased in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to the increased cost associated with supporting business growth across all regions of the world and the depreciation of the U.S dollar. Global Reinsurance The Global Reinsurance segment comprises the operations of the ACE Tempest Group ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, ACE Tempest Re USA, ACE Tempest Re Europe, and ACE Tempest Life Re (ACE Life Re). ACE Life Re is our Bermuda based life reinsurance operation and is addressed separately. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, Segment Information, under Item 1. Property and Casualty Reinsurance (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 Net premiums written $ 1,518 $ 1,229 $ 777 Net premiums earned 1,389 1,105 677 Losses and loss expenses 973 560 304 Policy acquisition costs 271 211 123 Administrative expenses 65 62 40 Underwriting income (loss) $ 80 $ 272 $ 210 Net investment income 126 87 82 Net realized gains (losses) 27 54 (43 ) Interest expense 1 Other (income) expense (1 ) (3 ) (1 ) Income tax expense 14 14 1 Net income $ 220 $ 402 $ 248 Loss and loss expense ratio 70.1% 50.6% 44.9% Policy acquisition cost ratio 19.5% 19.1% 18.1% Administrative expense ratio 4.6% 5.6% 5.9% Combined ratio 94.2% 75.3% 68.9% Global Reinsurances net premiums written increased 24 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to higher non catastrophe P&C production at ACE Tempest Re USA and ACE Tempest Re Europe, partially offset by a decrease in property catastrophe business at ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. In addition, Global Reinsurances retention ratio increased to 97 percent in 2004, compared with 93 percent in 2003. This increase in retention added $63 million to Global Reinsurances net premiums written. Net premiums written increased 58 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, driven by higher rates and increased P&C volume. 48 Table of Contents The following two tables provide a line of business and entity/divisional breakdown of Global Reinsurances net premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) % of total 2003 (Restated) % of total 2002 % of total Property and all Other $ 374 27% $ 311 28% $ 149 22% Casualty 688 50% 399 36% 159 23% Property catastrophe 327 23% 395 36% 369 55% Net premiums earned $ 1,389 100% $ 1,105 100% $ 677 100% (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 ACE Tempest Re Europe $ 303 $ 259 $ 142 ACE Tempest Re USA 751 468 182 ACE Tempest Re Bermuda 335 378 353 Net premiums earned $ 1,389 $ 1,105 $ 677 Net premiums earned increased 26 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, and 63 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increases were primarily due to the growing proportion of non catastrophe P&C business relative to catastrophe business over the last three years. ACE Tempest Re USA, which focuses on writing property per risk and casualty reinsurance, reported a 60 percent increase in net premiums earned in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to increased casualty business written and higher renewal rates. ACE Tempest Re Europe, which writes most lines of P&C with an orientation towards specialty and short tail products, reported a 17 percent increase in net premiums earned in 2004. This increase was primarily due to the robust casualty market in 2003 and early 2004, which offset weakness in property catastrophe and aviation. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, which principally provides property catastrophe reinsurance globally to insurers of commercial and personal property, reported an 11 percent decrease in net premiums earned in 2004. A market wide decline in rates on property catastrophe business, combined with our underwriting discipline has resulted in downward pressure on premium production for ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. The loss and loss expense ratio increased 19.5 percentage points in 2004 compared with 2003, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses. The following table shows the impact of catastrophe losses and prior period development on our loss and loss expense ratio for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 Loss and loss expense ratio, as reported 70.1% 50.6% 44.9% Catastrophe losses 22.2% 7.4% 13.0% Favorable prior period development (4.4)% (2.5)% (3.0)% Loss and loss expense ratio, adjusted 52.3% 45.7% 34.9% We recorded $309 million in catastrophe losses in 2004, compared with $82 million and $88 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. We experienced $61 million of net favorable prior period development in 2004, representing 6.6 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net favorable prior period development of $27 million, representing 5.2 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 favorable prior period development related primarily to property and other short tail lines and resulted from a difference between the actual experience and the expected claims emergence used to establish the reserves for accident years 2003 and 2002. The 2003 favorable prior period development related principally to the better than expected claims experience on property and short tail lines. Net favorable prior period development of $20 million was incurred in 2002, primarily due to lower than expected losses on property catastrophe business. 49 Table of Contents The remaining increase in the loss and loss expense ratio was primarily related to the shift in mix of business that has resulted from growth in non catastrophe P&C business at ACE Tempest Re USA and ACE Tempest Re Europe. Non catastrophe P&C business typically exhibits higher loss ratios than property catastrophe business (except in periods with high catastrophe losses). As Global Reinsurance increases non catastrophe P&C writing, we expect its loss and loss expense ratio to continue to increase in line with what would be expected from a traditional multi line reinsurer. Global Reinsurances policy acquisition cost ratio increased in 2004 and 2003, due to the higher proportion of business generated from ACE Tempest Re USA, relative to ACE Tempest Re Europe and ACE Tempest Re Bermuda. ACE Tempest Re USAs business is written more on a pro rata basis (versus excess of loss), which incurs higher acquisition costs due to the higher level of ceding commissions paid. Administrative expenses increased in 2004 and 2003, primarily due to higher staffing costs to support growth in business at ACE Tempest Re USA. The administrative expense ratio decreased in 2004 and 2003 due to increased net premiums earned. Life Reinsurance ACE Life Re principally provides reinsurance coverage to other life insurance companies, focusing on guarantees included in certain fixed and variable annuity products. The reinsurance transactions we enter into typically help clients (ceding companies) to manage mortality, morbidity, lapse and or capital market risks embedded in their books of business. We use sophisticated stochastic modeling techniques to price our reinsurance products based on robust actuarial and investment models which incorporate a number of factors. These factors include assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, demographics, persistency, investment returns, macroeconomic factors such as inflation and taxation and certain regulatory factors such as reserve and surplus requirements. Our reinsurance treaties are non proportional in nature, all of which incorporate some form of annual claim limit, and many of which include an aggregate claim limit as well as either an annual or aggregate claim deductible. We also use modeling software to monitor, measure, and manage the aggregate exposure which is bound by limits set by senior management. We assess the performance of our life reinsurance business based on life underwriting income which includes net investment income. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 2002 Net premiums written $ 220 $ 185 $ 159 Net premiums earned 220 184 158 Life and annuity benefits 172 181 158 Policy acquisition costs 22 16 16 Administrative expenses 4 3 6 Net investment income 33 33 27 Life underwriting income 55 17 5 Net realized gains (losses) 7 (21 ) (14 ) Net income (loss) $ 62 $ (4 ) $ (9 ) Life underwriting income improved in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to the increase in net premiums earned, combined with lower life and annuity benefits. Net premiums earned increased in 2004 primarily due to higher variable annuity production, while life and annuity benefits declined due to the increased proportion of premium volume from variable annuity products, which typically have lower expected benefit pay outs than other business. Net income increased, due to higher life underwriting income, combined with net realized gains which arose primarily due to movement in interest rates and the equity market in 2004 and the corresponding fair value adjustment on GMIBs, which amounted to a $10 million gain. Life underwriting income increased $12 million in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to higher investment income, combined with lower administrative expenses due to reduced staff levels. Financial Services The Financial Services segment consists of our financial solutions business and our proportionate share of Assured Guarantys earnings, which is 100 percent through April 28, 2004, and 34.7 percent thereafter. The financial solutions operations provide one off insurance and reinsurance solutions to clients with unique or complex risks, which are not adequately addressed in the traditional insurance market. Each financial solutions contract is structured to meet the needs of each client. Assured Guaranty provides credit enhancement products to the municipal finance, structured finance and mortgage markets. For more detail on each of our segments refer to the section entitled, Segment Information, under Item 1. 50 Table of Contents Certain products (principally credit protection oriented) issued by the Financial Services segment have been determined to meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. For more information see the section entitled Critical Accounting Estimates. From April 29, 2004, our proportionate share of Assured Guarantys earnings is reflected in Other (income) expense in our consolidated statement of operations. The equity in net income recorded from Assured Guaranty in 2004 was $46 million.

The decline was primarily a result of the sale of Assured Guaranty, which reduced net premiums written by $509 million. Additionally, the financial solutions operations reported LPT production of $27 million in 2004, compared with $274 million in 2003. With respect to the financial solutions business, premium volume can vary significantly from period to period and therefore premiums written in any one period are not indicative of premiums to be written in future periods. Financial Services net premiums written decreased 30 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to the termination of equity layer CDOs in connection with our sale of Assured Guaranty. The Financial Services segment reported an increase in underwriting income of 21 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase was mainly driven by a lower loss and loss expense ratio in our financial guaranty operations prior to the IPO of Assured Guaranty. This improvement in the loss and loss expense ratio was a result of the settlement of one off transactions in preparation for the IPO. Underwriting income increased 57 percent in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily due to a lower loss and loss expense ratio. We experienced $29 million of net favorable prior period development in 2004, representing one percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2004. This compares with 2003 net adverse prior period development of $43 million, representing 1.7 percent of the segments unpaid loss and loss expense reserves at January 1, 2003. The 2004 development was primarily related to $38 million of favorable prior period development in connection with the receipt of ceding company reports updating claims information on large high excess of loss assumed multi year contract and $14 million arising on a multi year claims made insurance policy for which it was determined that certain claims previously recognized in 2002 and 2003 would fall below policy attachment points. The favorable prior period development was partially offset by $20 million of adverse prior period development on several contracts following actuarial reviews that concluded with updated loss development patterns. The 2003 adverse prior period development arose principally on the structured finance line of business due to credit deterioration in collateralized debt obligations assumed through reinsurance treaties and, to a lesser extent, an increase in a case reserve on an auto residual value transaction. Net adverse prior period development of $30 million was incurred in 2002, primarily from the ACE Financial Solutions International book, which comprises large, unique transactions, including LPTs. 51 Table of Contents Net Investment Income Years Ended December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Insurance North American $ 469 $ 415 $ 409 Insurance Overseas General 224 166 113 Global Reinsurance P&C 126 87 82 Global Reinsurance Life 33 33 27 Financial Services 147 201 189 Corporate and Other 14 (2 ) (8 ) Net investment income $ 1,013 $ 900 $ 812 Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors, including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. Net investment income increased 13 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, and 11 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. The increased net investment income is due to the positive operating cash flows over the last three years which have resulted in a higher overall average invested asset base. An increase in U.S. interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2004 resulted in an increase in the investment portfolios average yield on fixed maturities to 4.1 percent at December 31, 2004. This compares with an average yield on fixed maturities of 4.0 percent and 4.4 percent at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The sale of Assured Guaranty during the year had the effect of reducing the average invested asset base for Financial Services which resulted in lower net investment income for that segment.  Net Realized Gains (Losses) Our investment strategy takes a long term view, and our investment portfolio is actively managed to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines, designed to minimize risk. Our investment portfolio is reported at fair value. The effect of market movements on our investment portfolio impact income (through net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when other than temporary impairments are recorded on invested assets or through the reporting of derivatives at fair value, including financial futures and options, interest rate swaps, GMIB reinsurance, and credit default swaps. Changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities, which result from the revaluation of securities held, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. The following table presents our pre tax net realized gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 Fixed maturities and short term investments $ 113 $ 100 $ (58 ) Equity securities 84 (41 ) (157 ) Other investments (21 ) (25 ) (12 ) Currency 1 21 3 Derivatives: Financial futures, options, spread locks and interest rate swaps 33 34 (188 ) Fair value adjustment on insurance derivatives (13 ) 176 (77 ) Subtotal derivatives 20 210 (265 ) Total net realized gains (losses) $ 197 $ 265 $ (489 ) Consistent with our investment objectives and the classification of our investment portfolio as available for sale, subject to guidelines as to asset classes, credit quality, and liquidity approved by our Finance Committee, our investment managers generally have the ability to sell fixed maturity, short term, or equity investments when they determine that an alternative security with comparable risks is likely to provide a higher investment return, considering the realized gain or loss on sale and differential in future investment income. Often, sales of individual securities occur when investment managers conclude there are changes in the credit quality of a particular security or, for other reasons, market value is 52 Table of Contents apt to deteriorate. Further, we may sell securities when we conclude it is prudent to reduce a concentration in a particular issuer or industry. Therefore, sales volume may increase in a volatile credit market in which credit spreads and thus the market value of fixed maturity investments are subject to significant changes in a short period of time. The interest rate environment will tend to have a limited effect on sales volume but extreme conditions could have an affect on the magnitude of realized gains or losses. For example, in a declining rate environment, the market value of securities increase, resulting in a greater likelihood of net realized gains and we would therefore tend to reduce the average duration of our fixed maturity investment portfolio. An increasing rate environment would tend to have the opposite effect. The effect of a high level of realized losses or gains for a particular period will tend to be offset by increases or decreases in investment income, respectively, in subsequent periods. From a liquidity perspective, our greatest risk is that we could be forced to sell a large volume of securities at a loss (i.e., in a high interest rate environment) to meet operating needs and are thus unable to reinvest proceeds to recoup such losses with future investment income (see section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information). FAS 133 requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, and measure them at fair value. We record the gains and losses resulting from the fair value measurement of derivatives in net realized gains (losses). We participate in derivative instruments in two principal ways as follows: i) to offer protection to others as the seller or writer of the derivative, such as our reinsurance of guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIBs) that are treated as derivatives for accounting purposes and our credit derivatives; or ii) to mitigate our own risk, principally arising from our investment holdings. We do not consider either type of transaction to be speculative. In 2004, we recorded net realized gains of $20 million on all derivative transactions. This compares with net realized gains on all derivatives of $210 million in 2003 and net realized losses on all derivatives of $265 million in 2002. Estimated changes in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income. Refer to Item 7A. of this Form 10 K/A for an analysis of the impact on our net income of changes in interest rates and the Standard and Poors (S&P) index. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties. We generally plan to hold derivative financial instruments to maturity. Where we hold derivative financial instruments to maturity, these fair value adjustments would generally be expected to reverse resulting in no gain or loss over the entire term of the contract. However, in the event that we terminate a derivative contract prior to maturity, as a result of a decision to exit a line of business or for risk management purposes, the difference between the final settlement of cash inflows and outflows and financial statement accruals for premiums and losses will be reflected as premiums earned and losses incurred, respectively. Additionally, at termination, any unrealized gain or loss, previously classified as a realized gain or loss, will be reversed and classified as a realized loss or gain, respectively. With respect to our GMIB reinsurance and credit derivatives businesses (insurance derivatives), we record a portion of the change in fair value in unpaid loss and loss expenses and future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts, respectively, representing our best estimate of loss pay outs related to fees or premiums earned, and a portion in net realized gains (losses), representing other changes in fair value. For 2004, the fair value adjustment included in net realized gains (losses), was net realized losses of $13 million. This compares with net realized gains of $176 million and net realized losses of $77 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004, the change in fair value was related to many factors including a loss of approximately $25 million related to the reversal of unrealized gains upon the termination of several credit default swaps. These credit default swaps were covering the equity layer of synthetic CDOs written by our financial solutions business. The unrealized losses were generally offset by increases in net premiums earned. In addition, net realized gains of $10 million were reported for GMIB reinsurance in 2004. The changes in the fair value of GMIBs are determined using internal valuation models. Such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty. The valuation of these products is subject to fluctuations arising from, among other factors, changes in interest rates, changes in the equity markets, and changes in the allocation of the investments underlying annuitants account value. These models and the related assumptions are continually reviewed by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely information, such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities. A net realized gain of $33 million was recorded on financial futures and option contracts and interest rate swaps in 2004. This compares with net realized gains of $34 million in 2003, and net realized losses of $188 million in 2002. We recorded a net realized gain of $8 million on interest rate swaps in 2004, compared with a net realized loss of $6 million in 2003. The interest rate swaps are designed to reduce the negative impact of increases in interest rates on our fixed maturity portfolio. In 2004, we recorded a net realized gain of $29 million on our S&P equity index futures contracts, as the S&P 500 equity index increased nine percent during the year. We use foreign currency forward contracts to minimize 53 Table of Contents the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies on certain non U.S. dollar holdings in our portfolio that are not specifically matching foreign currency liabilities. These contracts are not designated as specific hedges and we record all realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts as net realized gains (losses) in the period in which the currency values change. We regularly review our investment portfolio for possible impairment based on criteria including economic conditions, credit loss experience and issuer specific developments. If there is a decline in a securitys net realizable value, we must determine whether that decline is temporary or other than temporary. If we believe a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary, we record it as an unrealized loss in our shareholders equity. If we believe the decline is other than temporary, we write down the carrying value of the investment and record a net realized loss in our statement of operations. The decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as other than temporary rather than temporary has no impact on our book value. Once a security is identified as having a potential other than temporary impairment, we determine whether or not cost will ultimately be recovered and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the security until an expected recovery period, absent a significant change in facts that is expected to have a material adverse financial effect on the issuer. Our net realized gains (losses) in 2004 included write downs of $18 million related to fixed maturity investments, $9 million related to equity securities and $12 million related to other investments, as a result of conditions which caused us to conclude the decline in fair value of the investment was other than temporary. This compares with write downs of $29 million related to fixed maturity investments, $63 million related to equity securities and $29 million related to other investments in 2003. For 2002, our net realized gains (losses) included write downs of $101 million related to fixed maturity investments, $153 million related to equity securities and $14 million related to other investments. The process of determining whether a decline in value is temporary or other than temporary requires considerable judgment and differs depending on whether or not the security is traded on a public market as well as by type of security. As a result of our periodic review process, we have determined that there currently is no need to sell any of these securities to fund anticipated payments. We review all of our fixed maturity securities, including securities on loan, and equity securities for potential impairment each quarter. See Note 5 (e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for criteria we consider in assessing potential impairment. Note 5 (f) also includes a table which summarizes all of our securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004.  Other Income and Expense Items Years Ended December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities $ (41 ) $ (6 ) $ (5 ) Minority interest expense 22 18 3 Goodwill impairment 13 6 Other 9 16 38 Other (income) expense $ 3 $ 34 $ 36 Other expense decreased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, which was primarily comprised of $45 million from Assured Guaranty. Minority interest expense increased due to higher profitability in our rent a captive operations. Goodwill impairments increased primarily as a result of a review conducted during the first quarter of 2004 which led to a write down of goodwill relating to our Lloyds life syndicate. Other for 2004 includes compensation expense in connection with the settlement of ACE stock awards held by the employees of Assured Guaranty. The other expense for 2003 related to charges for commutation of a reinsurance contract. In 2004 and thereafter, these charges are included in the Corporate segment. Included in other for 2002 was $25 million in debt prepayment expense on the ACE INA Subordinated Notes due in 2009. This cost was primarily attributable to a decline in interest rates since the note was originally issued. Investments Our principal investment objective is to ensure that funds are available to meet our insurance and reinsurance obligations. Within this broad liquidity constraint, the purpose of our investment portfolios structure is to maximize total 54 Table of Contents return subject to specifically approved guidelines of overall asset classes, credit quality, and liquidity and volatility of expected returns. Our investment portfolio is invested primarily in fixed income securities with an average credit quality of AA, as rated by the independent investment rating service S&P. The portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional, investment managers. The average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of interest rate swaps, was 3.4 years at December 31, 2004, and 2003. Our other investments principally comprise direct investments, investments in investment funds, investments in limited partnerships and trading securities. The following table identifies our invested assets by type held at fair value and cost/amortized cost at December 31, 2004 and 2003. December 31, 2004 December 31, 2003 (in millions of U.S. dollars) (Restated) Fair Value Cost/Amortized Cost Fair Value Cost/ Amortized Cost Fixed maturities available for sale $ 22,891 $ 22,422 $ 19,312 $ 18,647 Short term investments 2,163 2,163 2,237 2,237 25,054 24,585 21,549 20,884 Equity securities 1,265 1,061 562 411 Investments in partially owned insurance companies 796 755 277 269 Other investments 606 551 444 409 Total investments $ 27,721 $ 26,952 $ 22,832 $ 21,973 We also gain exposure to equity markets through the use of derivative instruments. The combined equity exposure through both our equity portfolio and derivative instruments was valued at $1.4 billion and $662 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in our equity exposure is due to our efforts to diversify our portfolio and additionally due to increased equity returns in 2004, compared with 2003. Investments in partially owned insurance companies includes our 34.7 percent equity interest in Assured Guaranty which was valued at $530 million at December 31, 2004 and our 22.1 percent joint venture in Huatai our carrying value for this investment is approximately $147 million. The increase of $4.9 billion in total investments is due to positive cash flows from operations as a result of strong premium volume over the last several years. The increase in total investments was partially offset by a decline in invested assets of $1.8 billion, due to the sale of Assured Guaranty. 55 Table of Contents The following tables show the market value of our fixed maturities, short term investments and securities on loan at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The first table lists elements according to type, and the second according to S&P credit rating.

At December 31, 2004, our fixed income investment portfolio included below investment grade and non rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately seven percent of our fixed income portfolio. At December 31, 2003, eight percent of our fixed income portfolio was made up of below investment grade and non rated securities. We define a security as being below investment grade if it has an S&P credit rating of BB or less. Our below investment grade and non rated portfolio includes approximately 750 issues, with the top 15 holdings making up approximately 12 percent of the $1.9 billion balance at December 31, 2004. The highest single exposure in this portfolio of securities is $18 million. Below investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. Risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below investment grade securities. Below investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. Also, issuers of below investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions such as recession or increasing interest rates, than are investment grade issuers. We reduce the overall risk in the below investment grade portfolio, as in all investments, through careful credit analysis, strict investment policy guidelines, and diversification by issuer and or guarantor as well as by industry. Restricted Assets We are required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support our insurance and reinsurance operations. These requirements are generally promulgated in the statutory regulations of the individual jurisdictions. The assets on deposit are available to settle insurance and reinsurance liabilities. We also utilize trust funds in certain large transactions where the trust funds are set up for the benefit of the ceding companies and generally take the place of Letter of Credit (LOC) requirements. We also have investments in segregated portfolios primarily to provide collateral or guarantees for LOCs and debt instruments. (See Notes 9 and 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) 56 Table of Contents The following table identifies the value of restricted assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Deposits with U.S. regulatory authorities $ 857 $ 908 Deposits with non U.S. regulatory authorities 1,866 1,303 Assets used for collateral or guarantees 894 1,141 Trust funds 1,950 1,707 $ 5,567 $ 5,059 Deposits with non U.S. regulatory authorities increased 43 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, due to higher asset balances in support of our Lloyds Syndicate 2488. All syndicate assets are restricted under Lloyds Trust Deeds. Assets used for collateral or guarantees decreased 22 percent, primarily due to the sale of Assured Guaranty, combined with decreased use of our secured credit facility. The impact of the sale of Assured Guaranty on the trust funds balance was offset by increased asset balances to support growth at ACE Tempest Re USA. Additionally, with respect to one reinsurance contract, premiums had been deposited in a trust, invested in fixed maturities, for which an ACE affiliate in Bermuda provided an interest rate guarantee. Based on these guarantees, ACE concluded that it had the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership for the trust. Consequently, pursuant to the restatement, ACE has consolidated these trust assets of approximately $171 million effective January 1, 2004, the date the Company adopted FIN 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses We establish reserves for the estimated unpaid ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements. These reserves take into account estimates both for claims that have been reported and for IBNR, and include estimates of expenses associated with processing and settling claims. The table below presents a rollforward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Our estimates and judgments may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed; as new or improved methodologies are developed; or as current laws change. We do not discount our loss reserves, except for net loss and loss expense reserves of $157 million representing structured settlements for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable. The following table shows our total reserves segregated between case reserves and IBNR reserves.

Specialty includes aviation, satellite, marine, A&H, political risk and personal lines of business. The following table shows these components at December 31, 2004.

We estimate the ultimate loss amounts by projecting losses as of the valuation date using loss development patterns derived from historical data. In addition, a tail factor is applied to the projected loss amount to reflect further potential development beyond the period of historical record. While we believe our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2004 is adequate, new information or trends, such as judicial action broadening the scope of coverage or expanding liability, may lead to future developments in ultimate losses and loss expenses significantly greater or less than the reserve provided, which could have a material adverse effect on future operating results. Particularly significant variables for which a change in assumption could have a material effect on unpaid losses and loss expenses include, but are not limited to, the following: Insurance North American Segment Given the long reporting and paid development pattern, the tail factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for claims covered by our middle market workers compensation policies require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated losses and loss expense reserves. Specifically, a one percent change in the tail factor could cause approximately a $45 million change, either positively or negatively, for the selected net loss and loss expense ultimate for that segment. We believe that our selected tail factors represent the most likely loss development based on historical loss payment patterns of this and other comparable long tail lines of business as well as the current legal and economic environment. The actual tail factor could vary by several percentage points from the tail factor selected. Because tail factors are stated in terms of decimals (e.g., 1.125) and often, the actuarys choice regarding reasonably supportable tail factors range within percentages of each other, the realistic change in tail factors can be expressed in percentage points. Our ACE Bermuda operations write predominantly high excess of loss claims made professional liability business typically with attachment points in excess of $100 million. Claims development for this business can vary significantly for individual claims and historically could vary by as much as $50 million per claim depending on the nature of the loss. 58 Table of Contents Insurance Overseas General Certain international long tail lines, such as casualty and professional lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation. Heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world are increasing the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty of the reserving estimates. Our reserving methods rely heavily on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment, it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments. For example, a three month delay of our selected loss development patterns could increase reserve estimates on long tail casualty and professional lines by approximately $65 million. Global Reinsurance Typically there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reporting development patterns, especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers compensation or general liability, which may take up to 30 years to fully develop. This uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns as justified by the credibility of the data. The underlying source and selection of the final development pattern can thus have a significant impact on the selected net loss and loss expense ultimate. For example, a 10 percent slowing or quickening of the development pattern for certain long tail lines could cause the ultimate loss derived by the reported Bornhuetter Ferguson method to increase by as much as three percent, or $30 million. Assumed Reinsurance At December 31, 2004, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the Global Reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.5 billion, consisting of $400 million of case reserves and $1.1 billion of IBNR. Prior to 2000, our reinsurance operations had been concentrated in the property catastrophe reinsurance market. For catastrophe business, we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants, ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers, and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event. The latter internal analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves. In 2000, we began writing casualty lines of reinsurance in the United States, and to a lesser extent, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Given the long tail nature of this business, these new lines have both increased the amount of reserves in the Global Reinsurance segment as well as the uncertainty in the loss estimation process. For our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. Due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies, as well as other factors, the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: The reported claims information could be inaccurate. Typically, a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim. The use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag. Because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. The reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations. Therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines. The historical claims data for a particular reinsurance agreement can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available. Additionally, for many coverages, such as excess of loss contracts, there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability. In such cases, the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources. We mitigate the above risks in several ways. In addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable, we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate, complete, and timely. As appropriate, audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process. We also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses. On occasion, there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves recorded at ceding companies. This is due to the fact that we 59 Table of Contents only receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies with respect to case reserves. For IBNR, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss (see Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses for more information). We estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treatys coverage basis (i.e. risks attaching or losses occurring). At December 31, 2004, the case reserves reported to us by our ceding companies were $394 million, compared with the $408 million we recorded. We do, on occasion, post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant. Within the Insurance North American segment, we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run off since 1994. Unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run off reinsurance business resides within the Brandywine Division of our Insurance North American segment. Most of the remaining unpaid losses and loss expense reserves for the run off reinsurance business relate to asbestos and environmental claims. (See section entitled Asbestos and Environmental Claims for more information) Asbestos and Environmental and Other Run off Liabilities Included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for asbestos, environmental and latent injury damage claims and expenses (A&E). These A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily injury claims related to asbestos products and environmental hazards. The estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to the recent legal environment, including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims. These liabilities include provision for both reported and IBNR claims. The table below presents a roll forward of our selected loss reserve data for A&E exposures, excluding the provision for bad debts, for the year ended December 31, 2004. Asbestos Environmental and Other Latent Exposures Total (in millions of U.S. dollars) Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Balance at December 31, 2003* $ 3,168 $ 320 $ 1,205 $ 227 $ 4,373 $ 547 Losses and loss expenses incurred 1,073 430 38 29 1,111 459 Losses and loss expenses paid (357 ) (25 ) (188 ) (1 ) (545 ) (26 ) Foreign currency revaluation 13 4 13 4 Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 3,897 $ 729 $ 1,055 $ 255 $ 4,952 $ 984 * Includes reclassification of asbestos claims from other lines of business for comparative purposes. Our exposure to A&E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998 and the P&C business of CIGNA in 1999, with the larger exposure contained within the liabilities acquired in the CIGNA transaction. In 1996, prior to our acquisition of the P&C business of CIGNA, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner approved a plan to restructure INA Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Restructuring) which included the division of Insurance Company of North America (INA) into two separate corporations: (1) an active insurance company that retained the INA name and continued to write P&C business and (2) an inactive run off company, now called Century Indemnity Company (Century). As a result of the division, the A&E liabilities of INA were allocated to Century and extinguished, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, as liabilities of INA. As part of the Restructuring, the A&E liabilities of various U.S. affiliates of INA were reinsured to Century, and Century and certain other run off companies housing A&E liabilities were contributed to Brandywine Holdings Corporation (Brandywine Holdings). As part of the 1999 acquisition of the P&C business of CIGNA, we acquired Brandywine Holdings and its various subsidiaries. During the second half of 2004, we conducted an internal, ground up review of our consolidated A&E liabilities. During this same period, a team of external actuaries performed an evaluation as to the adequacy of the reserves of Century and its two U.S. insurance subsidiaries, ACE American Reinsurance Company (ACE American Re), and Century Reinsurance Company (Century Re), both Pennsylvania insurers. The external review was conducted in accordance with the Brandywine restructuring order, which requires that an external actuarial review of Centurys reserves be completed every two years. In January 2005, we announced net additions to our A&E and other run off reserves of $364 million exclusive of the provision for bad debts of $95 million. The net additions comprised A&E reserve increases of $453 million and favorable 60 Table of Contents prior period development of $89 million in other run off reserves. In addition, ACE Overseas General had gross and net A&E additions of $6 million resulting in a total A&E charge of $459 million for 2004. Our A&E reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any anticipated changes in the legal, social or economic environment, or any benefit from future legislative reforms. Accordingly, our A&E reserves make no allowance for future state or federal asbestos reforms, such as those currently being contemplated. The majority of our reserve increase in the fourth quarter of 2004 arose with the strengthening of a core group of major accounts impacted by changes in the asbestos industry landscape. In particular, our estimates of future liability were impacted by the continued negative effect of bankruptcies and an increase in defense costs to litigate cases. In 2004, the pre tax gross reserve increase related to the Brandywine operations was $788 million and $339 million net of reinsurance. The Brandywine reserve increase related not only to A&E exposures but also to other run off exposures included in the Brandywine operations. These other run off exposures increased pre tax gross reserves by $68 million while reducing net reserves by $89 million primarily due to favorable development in ceded IBNR in these other exposures. For Westchester Specialty, the A&E pre tax gross reserve increase was $385 million and $25 million net of reinsurance. In the January 2005 announcement the gross reserve increase in A&E was net of favorable gross reserve development in other run off exposures at Westchester Specialty of $180 million. ACE Overseas General also had an A&E pre tax reserve increase of $6 million gross and net of reinsurance. In 2003, there were no losses and loss expenses incurred for A&E. Paid losses for asbestos claims were $293 million on gross reserves and $169 million on net reserves. Environmental and other latent exposure claim payments were $204 million on gross reserves and $153 million on net reserves. For GAAP purposes, our A&E loss reserves are held at nominal value (i.e., they are not discounted despite the long term nature of liabilities). Reserving Considerations For asbestos, we face claims relating to policies issued covering product manufacturers, distributors, installers and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos. Claims can be filed by individual claimants or group of claimants with the potential for hundreds of individual claimants at one time. Claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies for a single insured. For asbestos, our internal definition of a count is a policyholder asbestos cause of action. For example, an asbestos manufacturer who faces products liability claims alleging bodily injury from exposure to their product would generate one count regardless of the number of policies we may have issued or the actual numbers of underlying claimants alleging damages. If however, the policyholder were to face claims arising under both an asbestos exposure and a combined silica and asbestos (mixed dust) exposure, each of these causative agents for that policyholder would generate a separate count. The table below summarizes count information for asbestos, environmental and long term exposure (LTE) claims for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, for direct policies only, and excludes claims from assumed reinsurance. 2004 2003 Asbestos (by causative agent) Open at the beginning of year 1,318 1,042 Newly reported 190 320 Closed or otherwise disposed 134 44 Open at end of year 1,374 1,318 Environmental (by site) Open at the beginning of year 8,588 9,145 Newly reported 549 720 Closed or otherwise disposed 1,965 1,277 Open at end of year 7,172 8,588 LTE (by causative agent) Open at the beginning of year 927 915 Newly reported 233 212 Closed or otherwise disposed 240 200 Open at end of year 920 927 61 Table of Contents The total pending counts for asbestos at December 31, 2004 are 1,374 as shown in the table above. In our January 6, 2005 disclosure on asbestos, we included a table that showed a total of 1,276 direct policyholders. The differences between the two numbers are as follows: The prior disclosure counted each policyholder only once regardless of whether there are multiple asbestos causes of action. The first category in that prior disclosure, 60 major asbestos manufacturers/producers, included closed accounts as well as a few accounts where ACE never had exposure. The table above reflects all of our U.S. based direct exposure. Policies issued by the Westchester Specialty operations are included above in addition to exposures under direct policies that are liabilities of the Brandywine operations. In our prior disclosure the claim count related solely to Brandywine. For environmental, we face exposure for remediation costs and defense associated with property damage as a result of pollution. It is common, especially for larger defendants, to be named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at multiple sites. Our count definition in the table above is based on policyholder by site numbers. For example, if a policyholder is named as a PRP at ten sites it would generate ten counts. In addition, should we have multiple policyholders identified as PRPs at the same waste site, each would generate a count. In 2004, the number of newly reported sites for environmental has continued the downward decline experienced in recent years. The number of new sites in 2004 was 549, representing a decline of 23.8 percent over the 720 new sites reported in 2003. Closed site counts increased in the same time period from 1,277 in 2003 to 1,965 in 2004. The net result of this decline in new reports and increase in closings is a 16.5 percent decline in open counts at December 31, 2004 versus the year prior. Long term exposure cases represent a collection of latent claims each with the potential for a large number of claimants. The exposures range from silica to silicon breast implants to lead and other chemical exposures. Our definition of a count is similar to asbestos. A policyholder will generate one count for each causative agent regardless of the number of policies or claimants alleging injury. In 2004, the number of newly reported asbestos counts declined to 190 versus 320 new claims in 2003. As we note elsewhere in this filing, the fourth quarter charge for asbestos was primarily a result of increases in costs for a small number of major asbestos defendants and to a lesser extent newly reported counts. Reinsurance and Other Considerations relating to ACEs Ultimate A&E and other Run off Exposures Westchester Specialty As part of the acquisition of Westchester Specialty, National Indemnity Company (NICO) provided a 75 percent pro rata share of $1 billion of reinsurance protection for adverse development on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. At December 31, 2004, the remaining unused limit under this NICO Westchester Specialty cover was $515.8 million. Brandywine Run off Entities As part of the acquisition of the CIGNA P&C business, NICO provided $2.5 billion of reinsurance protection to Century on all Brandywine loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and on the A&E reserves of various ACE INA insurance subsidiaries reinsured by Century (in each case, including uncollectible reinsurance). The benefits of this NICO agreement (the Brandywine NICO Agreement) flow to the other Brandywine companies and to the ACE INA insurance subsidiaries through reinsurance agreements between those companies and Century. The Brandywine NICO Agreement was exhausted on an incurred basis with the increase in the A&E reserves in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition to housing a significant portion of our A&E exposure, the Brandywine operations include run off liabilities related to various insurance and reinsurance businesses. The following companies comprise ACEs Brandywine operations: Century, a Pennsylvania insurer, Century Re, ACE American Re, Brandywine Reinsurance Company S.A. N.V., a Belgium insurer (Brandywine SANV), Century International Reinsurance Company Ltd., a Bermuda insurer (CIRC), and Brandywine Reinsurance Company (UK) Ltd., a U.K. insurer (BRUK). All of the Brandywine companies are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Brandywine Holdings except for BRUK, which is a direct subsidiary of ACE INA International Holdings, Ltd. (ACE INA International Holdings). BRUKs liabilities have been ceded to Century through CIRC. The U.S. based ACE INA companies assumed two contractual obligations in respect of the Brandywine operations in connection with the Restructuring: a dividend retention fund obligation and a surplus maintenance obligation in the form of an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement. In accordance with the Brandywine restructuring order, INA Financial Corporation established and funded a dividend retention fund (the Dividend Retention Fund) consisting of $50 million plus investment earnings. The full balance of the Dividend Retention Fund was contributed to Century as of 62 Table of Contents December 31, 2002. To the extent future dividends are paid by INA Holdings Corporation to its parent, INA Financial Corporation, and to the extent INA Financial Corporation then pays such dividends to INA Corporation, a portion of those dividends must be withheld to replenish the principal of the Dividend Retention Fund to $50 million within five years. In 2004 and 2003, no such dividends were paid, and therefore no replenishment of the Dividend Retention Fund occurred. The obligation to maintain and to replenish the Dividend Retention Fund as necessary and to the extent dividends are paid is ongoing until ACE INA receives prior written approval from the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner to terminate the fund. In addition, the ACE INA insurance subsidiaries are obligated to provide insurance coverage to Century in the amount of $800 million under an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement (the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement) if the statutory capital and surplus of Century falls below $25 million or if Century lacks liquid assets with which to pay claims as they become due, after giving effect to the contribution of the balance, if any, of the Dividend Retention Fund. Coverage under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement was triggered as of December 31, 2002 following contribution of the balance of the Dividend Retention Fund, because Centurys capital and surplus fell below $25 million at December 31, 2002. Effective December 31, 2004, ACE INA Holdings contributed $100 million to Century in exchange for a surplus note. After giving effect to the contribution and issuance of the surplus note, the statutory surplus of Century at December 31, 2004 was $25 million and approximately $458 million in statutory basis losses were ceded to the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement. Century reports the amount ceded under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement in accordance with statutory accounting principles, which differ from GAAP by, among other things, allowing Century to discount its asbestos and environmental reserves. For GAAP reporting purposes, intercompany reinsurance recoverables related to the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement are eliminated in consolidation. To estimate ACEs remaining claim exposure under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement under GAAP, we adjust the statutory cession to exclude the discount embedded in statutory loss reserves. At December 31, 2004, approximately $769 million in GAAP basis losses were ceded under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement, leaving a remaining limit of coverage under that agreement of approximately $31 million. If the limit of coverage were to be exhausted, ACEs results would nevertheless continue to recognize losses arising from any adverse loss reserve development of the Brandywine entities for so long as those companies remain consolidated subsidiaries of ACE. Uncertainties Relating to ACEs Ultimate Brandywine Exposure In addition to the Dividend Retention Fund and Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement commitments described above, certain ACE entities are primarily liable for asbestos, environmental and other exposures that they have reinsured to Century. Accordingly, if Century were to become insolvent and ACE were to lose control of Century, some or all of the recoverables due to these ACE companies from Century could become uncollectible, yet those ACE entities would continue to be responsible to pay claims to their insureds or reinsureds. Under such circumstances, ACE would recognize a loss in its consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate reinsurance balances ceded by the active ACE companies to Century were $1.58 billion. At December 31, 2004, Centurys carried reserves (including reserves ceded by the active ACE companies to Century) were $5.1 billion. We believe the intercompany reinsurance recoverables, which relate to liabilities payable over many years (i.e., 25 years or more), are not impaired at this time. The liabilities ceded to Century by its affiliates have in turn been ceded by Century to NICO and, as of December 31, 2004, approximately $2 billion of cover remains on a paid basis. As a result, any economic exposure there may be to adverse developments in the future is substantially less than the nominal value of the reinsurance recoverables. The impact of the transaction described below would reduce the balance due from Century to active ACE companies by $90 million. Should Centurys loss reserves experience adverse development in the future and should Century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation, the reinsurance recoverables due to Centurys affiliates would be payable only after the payment in full of all administrative expenses and direct policy liabilities. Thus, the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables. As of December 31, 2004, reserves ceded by Century to the active ACE companies and other amounts owed to Century by the ACE active companies were $930 million in the aggregate. In a lawsuit filed in California state court in December 1999 (AICCO, Inc v. Insurance Company of North America, et al.) certain competitors of ACE USA challenged the validity of the Restructuring under Californias Unfair Competition Law, Business and Professions Code Section 17200 (UCL). The lawsuit claims that the Restructuring is not applicable to California policyholders under the UCL because it constituted a transfer of liabilities without the consent of the policyholders. The suit also claims that the notice of the Restructuring was misleading. In November 2004, the voters of California approved Proposition 64 amending the UCL by, inter alia, requiring that lawsuits brought under the UCL be 63 Table of Contents brought by plaintiffs who have suffered actual injury as a result of the challenged business practice. In response to a motion to dismiss brought by ACE USA, the court ruled in February 2005 that the competitors/plaintiffs who brought this suit have not alleged actual injury as required by Proposition 64 and dismissed the suit. The time for appeal has not yet run and it is possible that the plaintiffs will appeal the ruling. Pending Sale of Certain Brandywine Companies Closing of the sale is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including without limitation the obtaining of all necessary consents and approvals from third parties, including the Pennsylvania Insurance Department and the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom, and the commutation of certain affiliate reinsurance agreements. In connection with certain of these commutations, Centurys assumed loss reserves would be reduced and an associated amount of coverage would become available under the Aggregate Excess of Loss Agreement. We are pursuing potential options for the disposition of other Brandywine entities, including a possible sale of Century. There can be no assurance that any such sale or other disposition will be consummated. Legislative Initiatives Congress has been working on possible legislation to move all U.S. asbestos bodily injury claims to a federal trust for compensation in accordance with an established set of medical criteria and claim values. The trust would be funded by asbestos defendants and their insurers. As currently proposed, ACE would be one of the insurer participants. However, we cannot predict if any such proposed legislation will be modified or adopted. Reinsurance One of the ways we manage our loss exposure is through the use of reinsurance. While reinsurance agreements are designed to limit our losses from large exposures and permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses, reinsurance does not relieve us of our liability to our insureds. Accordingly, the losses and loss expense reserves on our balance sheet represent our total unpaid gross losses. The reinsurance recoverable represents anticipated recoveries of a portion of those gross unpaid losses as well as amounts recoverable from reinsurers with respect to claims paid. The table below presents our net reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2004 and 2003. December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and loss expenses $ 1,210 1,277 Bad debt reserve on paid losses and loss expenses (309 ) (403 ) Reinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits 15 15 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 14,585 12,965 Bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses (619 ) (557 ) Net reinsurance recoverable $ 14,882 $ 13,297 Our reinsurance recoverable and bad debt reserve on paid losses and loss expense decreased in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to our decision to write off reinsurance recoverable balances (and associated bad debt reserves) which we believe to be uncollectible. This action had no significant impact on our net income. Reinsurance recoverable and bad debt reserve on unpaid losses and loss expenses increased in 2004, primarily due to the A&E reserve strengthening, increased catastrophe losses and also due to foreign exchange revaluations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. For more information see Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Liquidity is a measure of a companys ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations. As a holding company, ACE possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries, and of other investments. In addition to net investment income, our cash flows currently depend 64 Table of Contents primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments. Historically, these dividends and other payments have come from our Bermuda based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our Bermuda subsidiaries. As an insurance company, one of our principal responsibilities to our clients is to ensure that we have ready access to funds to settle large unforeseen claims. Given anticipated growth in premiums and a lengthening of the average duration of our claim liabilities due to a higher proportionate growth in long tail relative to short tail business, we expect that positive cash flow from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) will be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios through 2005. To further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims, we hold a certain amount of invested assets in cash and short term investments and maintain available credit facilities. In addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, such as loss portfolio contracts, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration matched with the related liabilities. With respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio, we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments. In a low rate environment, the overall duration of our fixed maturity investments tends to be shorter and in a high rate environment, such durations tend to be longer. Given the current low rate environment, at December 31, 2004, the average duration of our fixed maturity investments (3.4 years) is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities (4.1 years). Despite our safeguards, if paid losses accelerated beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could be several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time or large scale uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers credit problems or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables). Additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund loss payments were sold at depressed prices. Because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the ACE group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. As a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. If such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, we may be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations. With respect to the catastrophe losses during 2004, we anticipate all loss payments will be funded in the ordinary course of business due to positive operating cash flow combined with adequate balances of cash and short term investments. The payments of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies, which are discussed below. During 2004, we were able to meet all of our obligations, including the payment of dividends declared on our Ordinary Shares and Preferred Shares, with our net cash flow and dividends received. Should the need arise, we generally have access to the debt markets and other available credit facilities that are discussed below. We assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. Considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiarys financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. The legal restrictions on the payment of dividends from retained earnings by our Bermuda subsidiaries are currently satisfied by the share capital and additional paid in capital of each of the Bermuda subsidiaries. During 2004, ACE Bermuda and ACE Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd declared and paid dividends of $227 million and $259 million, respectively. During 2003, ACE Bermuda declared and paid dividends of $478 million, and ACE Cap Re International Ltd. declared and paid dividends of $25 million. We expect that a majority of our cash inflows for 2005 will be from our Bermuda subsidiaries. The payment of any dividends from ACE Global Markets or its subsidiaries would be subject to applicable U.K. insurance laws and regulations including those promulgated by the Society of Lloyds. ACE INAs U.S. insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, only from earned surplus and subject to certain annual limitations and the maintenance of a minimum capital requirement. ACE INAs international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. These laws and regulations include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. We did not receive any dividends from ACE Global Markets or ACE INA in 2004 or 2003. Under the Lloyds accounting model, syndicates in Lloyds operate each year as an annual venture. Each year of account is held open for three years. At the end of three years, the year of account purchases reinsurance from the next open year, which is known as reinsurance to close or RITC, and distributes the remaining funds to the investors in the syndicate. ACE Global Markets has historically 65 Table of Contents retained these funds for operational purposes. ACE INA issued debt to provide partial financing for the ACE INA acquisition and for other operating needs. This debt is serviced by dividends paid by ACE INAs insurance subsidiaries to ACE INA as well as other group resources. Our sale of 65.3 percent of the common shares of Assured Guaranty in the second quarter generated proceeds, net of offering costs, of approximately $835 million and a return of capital of $200 million from Assured Guaranty, which were used to support our P&C business and strengthen our balance sheet capital position. Our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, net investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Funds are used primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, dividends and for the purchase of investments. After satisfying our cash requirements, excess cash flows from these underwriting and investing activities are invested. Our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. Generally cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from year to year. The irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. Refer to the section entitled, Contractual Obligations and Commitments for our estimate of future claim payments by period. Sources of liquidity include cash from operations, financing arrangements or routine sales of investments. Our consolidated net cash flows from operating activities were $5 billion in 2004, compared with $4.3 billion in 2003 and $2.5 billion in 2002. These amounts reflect net income for each year, adjusted for non cash items and changes in working capital. Despite lower net income in 2004, net cash flows from operating activities increased, primarily due to an increase in net unpaid losses and loss expenses, compared with 2003. The increase in net cash flows from operating activities in 2003, compared with 2002, was primarily driven by higher net income and net unpaid losses and loss expenses, partially offset by lower unearned premiums. Typically, the adjustments to net income reflect the fact that there is a significant period of time between the recording of a loss (ranging up to several years or more) and the actual claim payment. Our consolidated net cash flows used for investing activities increased to $4.9 billion in 2004, and was net of $958 million received from the sale of Assured Guaranty (net of cash sold). This compares with net cash flows used for investing activities of $4.8 billion and $2 billion in 2003 and 2002, respectively. These increases reflect our strong consolidated net cash flows from operating activities. Net purchases of fixed maturities were $5 billion in 2004, compared with $4.9 billion and $2 billion in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our consolidated net cash flows used for financing activities were $155 million in 2004. This compares with net cash flows from financing activities of $395 million in 2003 and net cash flows used for financing activities of $491 million in 2002. Net cash flow usage for 2004 was related to increased dividends paid, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of options. The 2004 year also included net proceeds of $500 million from our debt issuance, which was partially offset by the repayment of debt and trust preferred securities of $475 million. The 2003 year included net proceeds of $557 million from our Preferred Share issuance. Net cash flows used for financing activities in 2002 were primarily driven by the repayment of $400 million of trust preferred securities. Although our ongoing operations continue to generate positive cash flows, our cash flows are currently impacted by a large book of loss reserves from businesses in run off. The run off operations generated negative operating cash flows of $88 million in 2004, compared with $645 million and $525 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily due to claim payments. The decrease in negative operating cash flows for 2004 relates primarily to funds received under the NICO agreement of $402 million. Both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Claim settlements, premium levels and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. In many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the liability for that loss. We believe that our cash balances, cash flow from operations, routine sales of investments and the liquidity provided by our credit facilities, as discussed below are adequate to meet expected cash requirements. ACE and its subsidiaries are assigned debt and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including S&P, A.M. Best, Moodys Investors Service and Fitch IBCA. The ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. Our website, acelimited.com, also contains some information about our ratings, which can be found under the Investor Information tab. Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies. Independent ratings are one of the important factors that estab 66 Table of Contents lish our competitive position in the insurance markets. The rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. These ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. Debt ratings apply to short and long term debt as well as preferred stock. These ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of principal and interest and preferred stock dividends. It is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. If one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. In addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. Capital Resources Capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations. The following table summarizes the components of our capital resources at December 31, 2004 and 2003. December 31 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) Short term debt $ 146 $ 546 Long term debt 1,849 1,349 Total debt 1,995 1,895 Trust preferred securities 412 475 Preferred shares 557 557 Ordinary shareholders equity 9,288 8,266 Total shareholders equity 9,845 8,823 Total capitalization $ 12,252 $ 11,193 Ratio of debt to total capitalization 16.3% 16.9% Ratio of debt plus trust preferreds to total capitalization 19.6% 21.2% We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short term and long term basis. Our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. We have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. As part of our capital management program, in November 2001, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of any ACE issued debt or capital securities including Ordinary Shares, up to $250 million. At December 31, 2004, this authorization had not been utilized. During 2004, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC relating to the issuance of up to $1.5 billion of certain types of debt and equity securities. This registration became effective during the first quarter of 2005. 67 Table of Contents Shareholders Equity The following table analyzes the movements in our shareholders equity for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) 2002 (Restated) Balance, beginning of year $ 8,823 $ 6,271 $ 6,012 Net income 1,153 1,483 100 Change in net unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax (50 ) 208 339 Dividends declared Ordinary Shares (233 ) (204 ) (173 ) Dividends declared Preferred Shares (45 ) (23 ) Cumulative translation adjustments 99 107 (7 ) Other movements, net 98 123 26 Dividends declared Mezzanine equity (10 ) (26 ) Issuance of Preferred Shares 557 Conversion of Mezzanine equity 311 Balance, end of year $ 9,845 $ 8,823 $ 6,271 Our diluted book value per Ordinary Share increased to $32.51 at December 31, 2004, compared with $29.42 at December 31, 2003. In calculating our diluted book value per Ordinary Share, we include in the money options in the denominator. The expected proceeds from the in the money options are included in the numerator. Shareholders equity increased $1 billion in 2004, primarily due to net income of $1.2 billion, cumulative translation adjustments of $99 million and the exercise of options for Ordinary Shares of $83 million (included in other movements, net), partially offset by dividends declared of $278 million. Also included in other movements, net, are changes in the accumulated benefits obligation for certain of our foreign defined benefit plans. The change was an increase in 2004, primarily due to decreases in the discount rate assumed in each year compared with the prior year, partially offset by increases in the underlying investment portfolio at the end of each year. On January 14, 2004 and April 14, 2004, we paid dividends of 19 cents per Ordinary Share to shareholders of record on December 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004, respectively. On July 14, 2004, October 14, 2004, and January 14, 2005, we paid dividends of 21 cents per Ordinary Share to shareholders on record on June 30, 2004, September 30, 2004, and December 31, 2004, respectively. We have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in 1993. However, the declaration, payment and value of future dividends on Ordinary Shares is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our profits, financial requirements and other factors, including legal restrictions on the payment of dividends and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. Dividends on the Preferred Shares are payable quarterly, in arrears, when and if declared by our Board of Directors. In 2004, we paid dividends of $4.875 per Preferred Share (which translates to 48.75 cents per Depositary Share) on March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1, to shareholders of record on February 29, May 31, August 31, and November 30, respectively. 68 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commitments The table below shows our contractual obligations and commitments including our payments due by period at December 31, 2004: Payments Due By Period (in millions of U.S. dollars)(Restated) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Payment amounts determinable from the contract Deposit liabilities $ 343 $ 110 $ 98 $ 44 $ 91 Operating leases 386 72 97 71 146 Short term debt 146 146 Long term debt 1,849 800 450 599 Trust preferred securities 412 412 Total obligations in which payment amounts are determinable from the contract 3,136 328 995 565 1,248 Payment amounts not determinable from the contract Estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts 31,483 6,001 10,412 3,261 11,809 Total contractual obligations and commitments $ 34,619 $ 6,329 $ 11,407 $ 3,826 $ 13,057 The above table excludes pension obligations, funding commitments to limited partnerships and future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts. Minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations are immaterial over the next year. Subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary due to many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time. In connection with our investments in limited partnerships, we have commitments that may require funding of up to $93 million over the next several years. As the timing of payment of these commitments is unknown, we have excluded the amount from the above table. We establish reserves for future policy benefits for life and annuity contracts, including, but not limited to, GMDBs and GMIBs. Payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract. We estimate that on a discounted basis, we expect to pay $509 million associated with these obligations, the majority of which will be paid in excess of five years. Deposit Liabilities Deposit liabilities of $343 million include reinsurance deposit liabilities of $238 million and contract holder deposit funds of $105 million. Contract holder deposit funds represent a liability for investment contracts sold that do not meet the definition of an insurance contract under FAS No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long Duration Contracts and Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments. The investment contracts are sold with a guaranteed rate of return. The proceeds are then invested with the intent of realizing a greater return than is called for in the investment contracts. Operating Lease Commitments We lease office space in most countries in which we operate under operating leases that expire at various dates through January 2018. We renew and enter into new leases in the ordinary course of business as required. Short term Debt From time to time, we use securities repurchase agreements as a source of short term liquidity. Under these repurchase agreements, we agree to sell securities and repurchase them at a future date for a predetermined price, thereby creating liquidity. The covenants of our existing credit facilities limit our borrowing under repurchase agreements to $800 million. At December 31, 2004, $146 million of reverse purchase agreements were outstanding. The proceeds were used to repay maturing commercial paper. Included in short term debt for 2003 was ACE INAs $400 million, 8.2 percent notes which became due on August 15, 2004. We repaid these notes in 2004. 69 Table of Contents In June 1999, we arranged certain commercial paper programs. The programs use revolving credit facilities as back up facilities and provide for up to $2.8 billion in commercial paper issuance (subject to the availability of back up facilities, which currently total $600 million) for ACE and for ACE INA. Long term Debt Our total long term debt of $1.8 billion is described in detail in Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2004, we issued $500 million of ACE INA 5.875 percent senior notes due June 15, 2014. The proceeds of the notes were used, to repay $75 million of Capital Re trust preferred securities, $400 million of ACE INA 8.2 percent notes due in 2004, and for general corporate purposes. The following instruments have specific collateral triggers. In 1998, ACE US Holdings issued $250 million of unsecured senior notes that mature in October 2008. In December 1999, ACE INA issued $300 million of unsecured subordinated notes that mature in December 2009 we repaid $100 million of this outstanding amount during 2002. We have a $450 million credit default swap in place that has the economic effect of reducing our cost of borrowing associated with these two issuances. The minimum collateral in connection with the credit default swap is $158 million. The actual collateral can be higher depending on the credit quality of securities pledged. Under these transactions, we would be required to provide collateral of $450 million if S&P downgraded our debt rating to BB+ or lower, or downgraded ACE Bermudas financial strength rating to BBB or lower. Although there can be no assurance, we believe it is unlikely that either of these two events will occur. In the event that we terminate either of the swaps prematurely, we would be liable for certain transaction costs. The counter party in each swap is a highly rated major financial institution and management does not anticipate non performance. Trust Preferred Securities During 1999 and 2000, we issued $800 million of trust preferred securities. The funds generated from these issues were used to partially finance the ACE INA acquisition. In 2002, $400 million of the trust preferred securities matured and were repaid. In 2004, we repaid an additional $75 million (Capital Re trust preferred securities). The securities outstanding consist of $400 million of company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred shares ($100 million and $300 million) issued by two business trusts wholly owned by us. Each of the two remaining series of trust preferred securities was issued by a special purpose entity (two trusts) that is wholly owned by us. The sole assets of the special purpose entities are debt instruments issued by one or more of our subsidiaries. The special purpose entities look to payments on the debt instruments to make payments on the preferred securities. We have guaranteed the payments on these debt securities. The trustees of the trusts include one or more of our officers and at least one independent trustee, such as a trust company. Our officers serving as trustees of the trusts do not receive any compensation or other remuneration for their services in such capacity. The full $412 million of outstanding trust preferred stock (calculated as $400 million as discussed above plus our equity share of the two trusts) is shown on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. Additional information with respect to the trust preferred securities is contained in Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimated Gross Loss Payments under Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts We are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts. As a P&C insurance and reinsurance company, such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation. In contrast to other contractual obligations, cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract. For example, we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts (i.e., when a loss event has not occurred) and if a payment is to be made, the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract. In the table above, we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and do not take reinsurance recoverables into account. These estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material. Given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of losses and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future losses and loss expense payments in the table above, differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates. 70 Table of Contents Credit Facilities As our Bermuda subsidiaries are not admitted insurers and reinsurers in the U.S., the terms of certain U.S. insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide LOCs to clients. In addition, ACE Global Markets is required to satisfy certain U.S. regulatory trust fund requirements which can be met by the issuance of LOCs. LOCs may also be used for general corporate purposes. The following table shows our credit facilities by credit line, usage and expiry date at December 31, 2004. (in millions of U.S. dollars) Credit Line1 Usage Expiry Date Unsecured Liquidity Facilities ACE Limited2 $ 600 $ 64 April 2007 Secured Operational LOC Facilities ACE Limited3 500 194 Sept. 2007 Other4 75 75 Various Unsecured Operational LOC Facilities ACE Limited5 850 770 Sept. 2007 ACE Limited6 100 97 Cancelled Unsecured Capital Facilities ACE Limited7 732 708 Dec. 2009 Total $ 2,857 $ 1,908 1. Certain facilities are guaranteed by operating subsidiaries and or ACE Limited 2. Commercial paper back up facility, may also be used for LOCs 3. On July 1, 2005, this facility was replaced by a letter of credit permitting the issuance of up to $500 million of LOCs on a secured basis and expiring on July 1, 2010. 4. These facilities are issued in the name of ACE European Group Limited, Lloyds Syndicate 2488 and Century Indemnity Insurance Company. 5. On July 1, 2005, this facility was replaced by a letter of credit permitting the issuance of up to $1 billion of LOCs on an unsecured basis and expiring on July 1, 2010. 6. In January 2005, this facility was cancelled and its letter of credit usage was transferred to other operational LOC facilities 7. Supports ACE Global Markets underwriting capacity for Lloyds Syndicate 2488 2005 capacity of &pound;400 million (approximately $750 million). During the second quarter of 2005, this facility was reduced from &pound;380 million to &pound;284 million. With the exception of the LOC facilities noted under Other, the facilities noted above require that we maintain certain covenants, all of which have been met at December 31, 2004. These covenants include: (i) maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth covenant of not less than $6.0 billion (subject to a reset provision on the last day of each fiscal year) plus 25 percent of cumulative net income since December 31, 2003 (subject to a reset provision on the last day of each fiscal year), plus 50 percent of net proceeds of any issuance of equity interests subsequent to December 31, 2003 (subject to a reset provision on the last day of each fiscal year); and (ii) maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1. Under this covenant, debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity, except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than 15 percent. In this circumstance, the amount greater than 15 percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2004, (a) the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in (i) above was $6.3 billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was $9.2 billion; and (b) our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 0.16 to 1. In addition to these covenants, the Funds at Lloyds capital facility requires that collateral be posted if the financial strength rating of ACE Limited falls to S&P BBB+ or lower. Our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. This could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize letters of credit under such facility. An event of default under one or more credit facilities with outstanding credit extensions of $25 million or more would result in an event of default under all of the facilities described above.  American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) was signed into law by the President of the United States. The Act provides for the election of a special one time tax deduction of 85 percent of certain foreign earnings that are 71 Table of Contents repatriated (as defined in the Act) under a Domestic Reinvestment Plan to its United States parent corporation in either the parents last tax year that began before the enactment date, or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the date of enactment. We expect to apply the provisions of the Act to certain of our applicable subsidiaries. In January and May 2005, the United States Treasury issued its guidance on selected provisions of the Act and on July 21, 2005, the Tax Technical Corrections Act of 2005 was introduced (H.R. 3376 and S.1447). Guidance issued to date provides clarification on several technical issues, with the remaining issues addressed in the proposed Technical Corrections Act. We repatriated foreign earnings of approximately $367 million, during the six months ended June 30, 2005, subject to Domestic Reinvestment Plans that would qualify under the Act based on the guidance issued to date. Of the $367 million repatriated foreign earnings to date, approximately $250 million will qualify for preferential tax treatment. The tax benefit associated with these repatriations was $27 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005, and was a result of the reduction of the net deferred tax liability associated with these repatriated earnings, based on guidance issued to date. The tax benefit recorded to date may increase by as much as approximately $7 million if the Tax Technical Corrections Act is passed. Additional earnings repatriations up to the limitation under the Act of $500 million may be completed through the remainder of 2005. Based on guidance issued to date, we are evaluating potential additional repatriations and are not in a position to complete our evaluation or determine the total associated tax impact as a result of the Act. However, based on our analysis to date, it is possible that we may ultimately repatriate up to an additional $250 million up to the limitation of qualifying dividends, with an associated tax benefit of up to $44 million. We expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by September 2005. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management Market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We are exposed to potential loss to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Further, through the writings of certain products such as credit derivatives (through our 34.7 percent ownership of Assured Guaranty), GMIBs and GMDBs, we are exposed to deterioration in the credit markets, decreases in interest rates and declines in the equity markets. Our investment portfolio consists of both fixed income and equity securities, denominated in both U.S. and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. As our fixed income and equity securities are classified as available for sale, changes in interest rates, equity prices or foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate affect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate affect on net income. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates and equity prices affect consolidated net income when, and if, a security is sold or impaired. From time to time, we also use investment derivative instruments such as futures, options, interest rate swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market. In addition, as part of our investing activity, we purchase TBAs. These instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and are sensitive to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity security prices. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are included in our net realized gains or losses and therefore have an immediate affect on both our net income and shareholders equity. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our notional exposure to investment derivative instruments was $3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to increased use of swaps, futures and options and the increase in our investment portfolio. We seek to mitigate market risk using a number of techniques, including maintaining and managing the assets and liabilities of our international operations consistent with the foreign currencies of the underlying insurance and reinsurance businesses, thereby limiting exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies. Also, from time to time, we enter into derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing certain investment portfolio exposures. 72 Table of Contents The following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at December 31, 2004. Our policies to address these risks in 2004 were unchanged from 2003. We do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods. Interest rate risk Our exposure to interest rate risk is primarily concentrated in our fixed income portfolio, our debt obligations and to a lesser extent, our GMIB reinsurance business. Changes in investment values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves and debt obligations. We monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our asset and liability positions. The following table shows the impact on the market value of our fixed income portfolio and debt obligations of an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve (an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario) at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 Fair value of fixed income portfolio $ 25,044 $ 21,266 Pre tax impact of 100 basis point increase in interest rates $ 800 $ 696 Percentage of total fixed income portfolio 3.2% 3.3% Changes in interest rates will have an immediate affect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate affect on net income. Although our debt, preferred stock, and trust preferred securities (collectively, referred to as debt obligations) are reported at amortized value and not adjusted for fair value changes, changes in interest rates could have a material impact on their fair value, albeit there is no immediate impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2004, the amortized value of our debt obligations was $2.8 billion and the fair value was $3.1 billion. An increase in interest rates of 100 basis points applied instantly across the yield curve would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our debt obligations of 6.7 percent at December 31, 2004. This equates to a pre tax decrease in the fair value of our debt obligations of $209 million at December 31, 2004. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of prepayments due to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables. Our net income is directly impacted by changes in the fair value of GMIBs. For example, net realized gains of $10 million were reported for GMIB reinsurance for the year ended December 31, 2004. The changes in the fair value of GMIBs are determined using internal valuation models. Such valuations require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty. The valuation of these products is subject to fluctuations arising from, among other factors, changes in interest rates, changes in the equity markets, and changes in the allocation of the investments underlying annuitants account value. These models and the related assumptions are continually reviewed by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely information, such as market conditions and demographics of in force annuities. Based on in force annuities covered by GMIB reinsurance treaties at December 31, 2004, we estimate that a downward parallel shift of the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $147 million. This estimated change in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Equity price risk Our portfolio of equity securities, which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value, has exposure to price risk. This risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices. In addition, we attain exposure to the equity markets through the use of derivative instruments, which also have exposure to price risk. Our U.S. equity portfolio is correlated with the S&P 500 index and changes in that index would approximate the impact on our portfolio. 73 Table of Contents Our international equity portfolio has exposure to a broad range of non U.S. equity markets. The following table provides more information on our exposure to equity price risk at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 (Restated) 2003 (Restated) Fair value of equity securities $ 1,266 $ 562 Fair value of equity derivative instruments 131 118 Total equity exposure $ 1,397 $ 680 Pre tax impact of 10 percent decline in market prices for equity exposures $ 140 $ 68 Changes in fair value of the derivative equity instruments are recorded as net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of our equity portfolio are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. As discussed above, our net income is directly impacted by changes in the fair value of GMIBs. Based on in force annuities covered by GMIB reinsurance treaties at December 31, 2004, we estimated that a 10 percent decline in the S&P index would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $55 million. This estimated change in fair value would be recorded as net realized losses in our net income. The gain or loss created by the estimated fair value adjustment will rise or fall each period based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims. Foreign currency exchange rate risk Many of our non U.S. companies maintain both assets and liabilities in local currencies. Therefore, foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies. Foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process. Locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements, and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations. The principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the British pound sterling, the euro and the Canadian dollar. The following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at December 31, 2004 and 2003. (millions of U.S. dollars) 2004 2003 Fair value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies $ 1,555 $ 825 Percentage of fair value of total net assets 15.8 % 9.3 % Pre tax impact of hypothetical 10% strengthening of U.S. dollar* $ 100 $ 65 * Versus the British pound sterling, the euro and the Canadian dollar
