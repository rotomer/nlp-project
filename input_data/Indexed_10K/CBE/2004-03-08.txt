ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Cooper is subject to various suits, legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a future additional material adverse effect on Coopers financial statements. In October 1998, Cooper sold its Automotive Products business to Federal Mogul Corporation ("Federal Mogul"). These discontinued businesses (including the Abex product line obtained from Pneumo Abex Corporation ("Pneumo") in 1994) were operated through subsidiary companies, and the stock of those 8 subsidiaries was sold to Federal Mogul pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 17, 1998 ("1998 Agreement"). In conjunction with the sale, Federal Mogul indemnified Cooper for certain liabilities of these subsidiary companies, including liabilities related to the Abex product line and any potential liability that Cooper may have to Pneumo pursuant to a 1994 Mutual Guaranty Agreement between Cooper and Pneumo. On October 1, 2001, Federal Mogul and several of its affiliates filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and indicated that Federal Mogul may not honor the indemnification obligations to Cooper. As of the date of this filing, Federal Mogul had not yet made a decision whether to reject the 1998 Agreement, which includes the indemnification to Cooper. If Federal Mogul rejects the 1998 Agreement, Cooper will be relieved of its future obligations under the 1998 Agreement, including specific indemnities relating to payment of taxes and certain obligations regarding insurance for its former Automotive Products businesses. To the extent Cooper is obligated to Pneumo for any asbestos related claims arising from the Abex product line ("Abex Claims"), Cooper has rights, confirmed by Pneumo, to significant insurance for such claims. Based on information provided by representatives of Federal Mogul and recent claims experience, from August 28, 1998 through December 31, 2003, a total of 114,976 Abex Claims were filed, of which 52,281 claims have been resolved leaving 62,695 Abex Claims pending at December 31, 2003, that are the responsibility of Federal Mogul. During the year ended December 31, 2003, 11,843 claims were filed and 20,290 claims were resolved. Since August 28, 1998, the average indemnity payment for resolved Abex Claims was $1,846 before insurance. A total of $50 million was spent on defense costs for the period August 28, 1998 through December 31, 2003. Historically, existing insurance coverage has provided 50% to 80% of the total defense and indemnity payments for Abex Claims. With the assistance of independent advisors, Bates White, LLC, in the fourth quarter of 2001 Cooper completed a thorough analysis of its potential exposure for asbestos liabilities in the event Federal Mogul rejects the 1998 Agreement. Based on Coopers analysis of its contingent liability exposure resulting from Federal Moguls bankruptcy, Cooper concluded that an additional fourth quarter 2001 discontinued operations provision of $30 million after tax, or $.32 per share, was appropriate to reflect the potential net impact of this issue. The analysis included a review of the twenty year history of Abex Claims; the average indemnity payments for resolved claims; the jurisdictions in which claims had been filed; Bates White, LLC data on the incidence of asbestos exposure and diseases in various industries; existing insurance coverage including the insurance recovered by Pneumo and Federal Mogul for pre bankruptcy claims and the contractual indemnities. Assumptions were made regarding future claim filings and indemnity payments, and, based on the advisors data, the expected population of persons exposed to asbestos in particular industries. All of this data was used to determine a reasonable expectation of future claims, indemnity payments and insurance coverage. Cooper is preserving its rights as a creditor for breach of Federal Moguls indemnification to Cooper and its rights against all Federal Mogul subsidiaries. Cooper intends to take all actions to seek a resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. Coopers fourth quarter 2001 analysis of the contingent liability exposure assumed that the liabilities would be settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. This analysis assumed that representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants (the "Representatives") would reach similar conclusions regarding the potential future liabilities and insurance recoveries as Cooper did based on the Bates White, LLC analysis. Throughout 2003, Cooper worked towards resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. This included negotiations with the Representatives regarding participation in Federal Moguls proposed 524(g) asbestos trust. Based on the status of the recent negotiations in 2004, Cooper concluded that it is probable that Federal Mogul will reject the 1998 Agreement. Cooper also concluded that the Representatives would require any negotiated settlement through the Federal Mogul bankruptcy to be at the high end of the Bates White, LLC liability analysis and with substantially lower insurance recovery assumptions and higher administrative costs. While Cooper believes that the insurance has significant additional value, extensive litigation with the insurance carriers may be required to receive recoveries and there is risk that court decisions could reduce the value of the recoveries. Additionally, the assumptions on liability payments could prove inaccurate over 9 time. If Cooper is unable to reach a settlement with the Representatives and the 1998 Agreement is rejected, Cooper would be required to reflect an accrual for the total estimated liability and a receivable for the probable insurance recoveries. Generally accepted accounting principles provide relatively conservative requirements for the recording of insurance recoveries and a substantial portion of the potential insurance recoveries would not be reflected as receivables until future events occur. During late February and early March 2004, Cooper reassessed the accrual required based on the current status of the negotiations with the Representatives and the liability and insurance receivable that would be required to be recorded if this matter is not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper concluded that resolution within the Federal Mogul proposed 524(g) asbestos trust would likely be within the range of the liabilities, net of insurance recoveries, that Cooper would accrue if this matter were not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Accordingly, Cooper recorded a $126.0 million after tax discontinued operations charge, net of a $70.9 income tax benefit, in the fourth quarter of 2003. Cooper is continuing negotiations with the Representatives. At this time, the exact manner in which this issue will be resolved is not known. At December 31, 2003, the accrual for potential liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale and the Federal Mogul bankruptcy was $252.5 million. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report, no matters were submitted to a vote of the shareholders. 10 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Cooper Class A common shares (symbol CBE) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Options for Cooper Class A common shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange. Cooper Class B common shares are not publicly traded. Cooper Industries, Inc. is the only holder of Class B common shares. The Class B common shares were issued to Cooper Industries, Inc. in connection with the reincorporation merger whereby Cooper Industries, Inc., formerly the publicly traded parent company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cooper Industries, Ltd. The holders of Class B common shares are not entitled to vote, except as to matters for which the Bermuda Companies Act specifically requires voting rights for otherwise nonvoting shares. Cooper Industries, Ltd. and Cooper Industries, Inc. have entered into a voting agreement whereby any Class A or Class B common shares held by Cooper Industries, Inc. will be voted (or abstained from voting) in the same proportion as the other holders of Class A common shares. Therefore, Class A and Class B common shares held by Cooper Industries, Inc. do not dilute the voting power of the Class A common shares held by the public. As of March 1, 2004 there were 25,974 record holders of Cooper Class A common shares and one holder of Cooper Class B common shares. The high and low quarterly sales price for the past two years of Cooper Class A common shares (and prior to May 22, 2002, Cooper Industries, Inc. Common Stock, par value $5.00 per share), as reported by Dow Jones & Company, Inc., are as follows: QUARTER 1 2 3 4 2003 High $39.25 $42.00 $51.65 $58.85 Low 33.86 35.65 40.34 48.03 2002 High $42.55 $47.10 $39.55 $38.50 Low 30.20 37.00 27.14 27.55 Annual cash dividends declared on Coopers Class A and Class B common shares (and prior to May 22, 2002, Cooper Industries, Inc. Common Stock, par value $5.00 per share) during 2003 and 2002 were $1.40 a share ($.35 a quarter). On February 11, 2004, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $.35 a share (or $1.40 on an annualized basis), which will be paid on April 1, 2004 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2004. Coopers subsidiary, Cooper Industries, Inc., waived the right to receive all dividends on Class A and Class B common shares held by it in 2002 and 2003 and in February 2004. 11 ITEM 6.

See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 12 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes certain forward looking statements. The forward looking statements reflect Coopers expectations, objectives and goals with respect to future events and financial performance, and are based on assumptions and estimates which Cooper believes are reasonable. Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the facilities closure and production rationalization plan and cost reduction programs (including implementation of an Enterprise Business System), resolution of income tax matters, potential liability exposure resulting from Federal Mogul Corporations ("Federal Mogul") bankruptcy filing and any statements regarding future revenues, costs and expenses, earnings, earnings per share, margins, cash flows and capital expenditures. Cooper wishes to caution readers not to put undue reliance on these statements and that actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Important factors which may affect the actual results include, but are not limited to, the resolution of Federal Moguls bankruptcy proceedings, political developments, market and economic conditions, changes in raw material and energy costs, industry competition, the net effects of Coopers cost reduction programs, the timing and net effects of facility closures and the magnitude of any disruptions from such closures, changes in mix of products sold, mergers and acquisitions and their integration into Cooper, the timing and amount of any stock repurchases by Cooper, changes in financial markets including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changing legislation and regulations including changes in tax law, tax treaties or tax regulations. The forward looking statements contained in this report are intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Cooper believes the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts. Cooper recognizes revenues when products are shipped and accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience. If actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, additional allowances may be required. The accrual for sales returns and other allowances was $33.8 million and $27.2 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Allowances for excess and obsolete inventory are provided based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances may be required. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $47.6 million at December 31, 2003 and $41.0 million at December 31, 2002. Cooper had a valuation allowance of $21.7 million at December 31, 2002 to reduce its deferred tax asset related to a capital loss carryforward on the 1998 sale of the Automotive Products segment. The capital loss carryforward was available to offset capital gains through 2003. The capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset balance was $21.7 million at December 31, 2002. Cooper limited the amount of tax benefits recognizable from this asset based on an evaluation of the amount of capital loss carryforward that was expected to be realized. Cooper implemented strategies to realize the capital loss carryforward asset and reclassified the reduction in the valuation allowance to other tax liabilities in 2003. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, discount rates and estimated future 13 employee earnings and demographics. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Differences between actuarial assumptions and estimates and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of a calculated minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service period of active employees. Declining interest rates resulted in a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure plan obligations from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.25% in 2003. The decrease in the discount rate caused an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation amount. During 2001 and 2002, the fair market value of the equity investments included in pension plan assets decreased significantly, primarily as a result of the overall downturn in the U.S. stock market. The accumulated benefit obligation of certain plans exceeded the fair market value of plan assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002. This unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, plus the existing prepaid asset resulted in a $22.9 million and $33.4 million net of tax minimum pension liability charge included in accumulated other nonowner changes in equity at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total net periodic pension benefits cost was $28.7 million in 2003, $16.7 million in 2002 and $11.6 million in 2001. The increase in net periodic pension cost in 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in the expected return on plan assets and an increase in recognized actuarial losses. Total net periodic pension benefits cost is currently expected to approximate $25.0 million in 2004. The net periodic pension benefit cost for 2004 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 6.25% and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5%. The expected decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily results from 2002 and 2003 pension plan contributions and increased returns on plan assets, as the U.S. stock market recovered in 2003. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The postretirement benefits other than pensions liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of postretirement benefits expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of a minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the participants. The decline in interest rates over the past three years resulted in a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure postretirement benefit obligations from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.25% in 2003. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost is expected to decrease slightly to $5.5 million in 2004 compared to $5.8 million in 2003, $5.2 million in 2002 and income of $1.3 million in 2001. The increase in net periodic postretirement benefit cost in 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of recognized actuarial gains. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites owned by Cooper and third party sites where Cooper was determined to be a potentially responsible party. Third party sites frequently involve multiple potentially responsible parties and Coopers potential liability is determined based on estimates of Coopers proportionate responsibility for the total cleanup. The amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates as well as an assessment of the financial capacity of the other potentially responsible parties. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, Coopers estimate of its environmental liabilities may change. The liability for environmental remediation was $38.9 million at December 31, 2003 and $42.2 million at December 31, 2002. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper revised the accrual that represents its best estimate of liabilities related to the sale of the Automotive Products business to Federal Mogul in 1998. During the three year period ending December 31, 2003, Cooper accounted for payments made to settle asbestos related cases by reducing the accrual. Subsequent proceeds from insurance claims for these settlements would increase the accrual. The liabilities include potential liabilities in the event Federal Mogul rejects the 1998 Purchase 14 and Sale Agreement for the sale of the Automotive Products business and certain indemnification obligations to Cooper. The analysis of Coopers contingent liability exposure for asbestos related claims involving Abex products was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2001 with assistance from independent advisors, Bates White, LLC, and assumed future resolution of the Abex related asbestos claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceeding. The analysis included a review of the twenty year history of Abex claims; the average indemnity payments for resolved claims; the jurisdictions in which claims had been filed; Bates White, LLC data on the incidence of asbestos exposure and diseases in various industries; existing insurance coverage including the insurance recovered by Pneumo Abex Corporation and Federal Mogul for pre bankruptcy claims and the contractual indemnities. Assumptions were made regarding future claim filings and indemnity payments, and, based on advisors data, the expected population of persons exposed to asbestos in particular industries. All of this data was used to determine a reasonable expectation of future claims, indemnity payments and insurance coverage. As discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, throughout 2003, Cooper worked towards resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. This included negotiations with representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants ("Representatives") regarding participation in Federal Moguls proposed 524(g) asbestos trust. Coopers fourth quarter 2001 analysis of the contingent liability exposure assumed that the liabilities would be settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. This analysis assumed that the Representatives would reach similar conclusions regarding the potential future liabilities and insurance recoveries as Cooper did based on the Bates White, LLC analysis. Based on the status of the negotiations during 2004, Cooper concluded that it is probable that Federal Mogul will reject the 1998 Agreement. Cooper also concluded that the Representatives would require any negotiated settlement through the Federal Mogul bankruptcy to be at the high end of the Bates White, LLC liability analysis and with substantially lower insurance recovery assumptions and higher administrative costs. While Cooper believes that the insurance has significant additional value, extensive litigation with the insurance carriers may be required to receive recoveries and there is risk that court decisions could reduce the value of the recoveries. Additionally, the assumptions on liability payments could prove inaccurate over time. If Cooper is unable to reach a settlement with the Representatives and the 1998 Agreement is rejected, Cooper would be required to reflect an accrual for the total estimated liability and a receivable for the probable insurance recoveries. Generally accepted accounting principles provide relatively conservative requirements for the recording of insurance recoveries and a substantial portion of the potential insurance recoveries would not be reflected as receivables until future events occur. During late February and early March 2004, Cooper reassessed the accrual required based on the current status of the negotiations with the Representatives and the liability and insurance receivable that would be required to be recorded if this matter is not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper concluded that resolution within the Federal Mogul proposed 524(g) asbestos trust would likely be within the range of the liabilities, net of insurance recoveries, that Cooper would accrue if this matter were not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Accordingly, Cooper recorded a $126.0 million after tax discontinued operations charge in the fourth quarter of 2003. Cooper is continuing negotiations with the Representatives. At this time, the manner in which this issue will be resolved is not known. At December 31, 2003, the accrual for potential liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale and the Federal Mogul bankruptcy was $252.5 million. 15 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REVENUES Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Electrical Products......................... $ 3,358.4 $ 3,324.9 $ 3,485.5 Tools & Hardware............................ 703.0 635.6 724.0 Total Revenues......................... $ 4,061.4 $ 3,960.5 $ 4,209.5 See the geographic information included in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of revenues by country. 2003 vs. 2002 Revenues Revenues increased 3% in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign currency translation increased total 2003 revenues by approximately 2%. Electrical Products revenues for 2003, which represent 83% of total revenues, increased 1% over 2002. Foreign currency translation increased Electrical Products revenues by approximately 2%. Modest sequential improvement in industrial and electronic markets, plus the benefits of Coopers new product development and market penetration programs resulted in revenue gains in the hazardous duty, circuit protection and wiring devices businesses. Coopers lighting fixtures business was up slightly, as an improvement in commercial and industrial markets was offset by the impact of inventory management initiatives within the retail channel. Coopers support systems business continued to be pressured by weak non residential and telecommunications markets. Controls over discretionary spending by utilities negatively impacted the power transmission and distribution equipment market. Coopers European lighting and security business, absent favorable currency translation, experienced slightly reduced sales compared to the prior year. Tools & Hardware segment revenues, which contributed 17% to total 2003 revenues, were 11% higher than 2002. Power tools experienced growth in European based industrial power tools and assembly equipment markets. Hand tools sales improved over the prior year primarily as a result of increased demand from the retail channel, driven by new product offerings. A weak U.S. Dollar increased total Tools & Hardware revenues during 2003 by approximately 5%. 2002 vs. 2001 Revenues Revenues decreased 6% in 2002 compared to 2001. Foreign currency translation had an insignificant impact on revenues during 2002 in both business segments. Weak industrial markets worldwide affected demand across all of Coopers businesses. Electrical Products segment revenues, which represent 84% of 2002 total revenues, were 5% below 2001. Continued weakness in the North American economy affected the markets served by the Electrical Products segment. A contraction in domestic industrial activity and commercial construction impacted demand and increased price pressures for Coopers lighting, hazardous duty and support systems products. The impact of these weak markets was partially offset by strong retail channel sales, particularly for Coopers residential lighting and wiring devices products. An uncertain economic environment for utility customers reduced sales of electrical distribution equipment. A modest recovery in the electronics markets led to an increase in sales of circuit protection products. The Tools & Hardware segment contributed 16% of total revenues in 2002. Revenues for 2002 were 12% below 2001. Worldwide demand was weak for both hand tools and power tools used in general industrial and electronics markets. Shipments of automotive assembly equipment were lower than the prior year as a result of reduced capital spending by automotive companies. 16 OPERATING RESULTS Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (in millions, except per share data) Electrical Products............................................ $ 418.7 $ 376.6 $ 413.0 Tools & Hardware............................................... 39.4 14.6 68.6 Total Segment Operating Earnings.......................... 458.1 391.2 481.6 General Corporate Expense...................................... 66.1 36.5 80.5 Operating Earnings............................................. 392.0 354.7 401.1 Interest Expense, net.......................................... 74.1 74.5 84.7 Interest Income on Tax Refund..................................

All costs directly attributable to operating businesses are included in segment operating earnings. Corporate overhead costs, including costs of traditional headquarters activities, such as treasury, are not allocated to the businesses. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cooper adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142") on January 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 17 2003 vs. 2002 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $458.1 million in 2003, compared to $391.2 million in 2002. Electrical Products segment 2003 operating earnings were $418.7 million compared to $376.6 million for 2002. Return on revenues was 12.5% in 2003, compared to 11.3% in 2002. Included in the Electrical Products segment earnings were restructuring charges in 2003 and 2002 totalling $16.4 million and $24.0 million, respectively. Excluding the restructuring charges in both years, the increase in Electrical Products segment earnings was primarily due to the improvement in margins as a result of cost reduction and productivity actions targeting manufacturing costs. The favorable impact of these actions was partially offset by increased insurance, pension and employee benefit expenses and investments in sales and marketing initiatives. Tools & Hardware segment operating earnings were $39.4 million for 2003, compared to $14.6 million for 2002. Return on revenues was 5.6% in 2003, compared to 2.3% in 2002. Included in Tools & Hardware segment earnings for 2003 was a net $0.4 million favorable adjustment reflecting the reversal of excess 2002 restructuring charges partially offset by 2003 restructuring charges. Tools & Hardware segment earnings for 2002 included restructuring charges of $12.7 million. Absent the impact of restructuring charges in both years, the increase in Tools & Hardware segment earnings largely reflects the increase in revenues and the impact of Coopers cost control and manufacturing rationalization efforts, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and higher insurance, pension and employee benefit expenses. 2002 vs. 2001 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings decreased to $391.2 million in 2002 from $481.6 million in 2001. Electrical Products segment operating earnings decreased to $376.6 million from $413.0 million in 2001. Return on revenues was 11.3% in 2002 compared to 11.8% in 2001. Electrical Products segment operating earnings for 2001 include goodwill amortization of $51.5 million. Included in the Electrical Products segment earnings were restructuring charges of $24.0 million in each year. Excluding these restructuring charges and goodwill amortization, the reduction in segment earnings from the prior year was due to lower revenues reflective of the overall weakness of industrial and non residential construction markets, competitive market conditions, lower absorption of production costs as a result of aggressive actions to reduce inventory levels and investments in strategic growth programs. The Tools & Hardware segment operating earnings were $14.6 million compared to $68.6 million in 2001. Return on revenues was 2.3% in 2002 compared to 9.5% in 2001. Tools & Hardware segment operating earnings for 2001 include goodwill amortization of $9.2 million. Included in Tools & Hardware segment earnings for 2002 were restructuring charges of $12.7 million. Excluding these restructuring charges and goodwill amortization, the lower operating earnings primarily reflect the impact of reduced revenues from the prior year and plant inefficiencies from operating at reduced levels of manufacturing to achieve planned inventory reductions. RESTRUCTURING During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper recorded net restructuring charges of $16.9 million, or $13.6 million after taxes ($.14 per diluted common share). This represented costs associated with restructuring projects undertaken in 2003 of $18.4 million, partially offset by a $1.5 million adjustment of estimates for restructuring projects initiated in 2002. The most significant action included in the charges was an announcement of the closing of Cooper Wiring Devices manufacturing operations in New York City. This action will include the withdrawal from a multiple employer pension plan. Cooper recorded a $12.5 million obligation as an estimate of Coopers portion of unfunded benefit obligations of the plan. The remaining $5.9 million charge primarily represents severance for announced employment reductions at several locations. The 2003 net impact of the charges was $16.4 million on the Electrical Products segment, $(0.4) million on the Tools & Hardware segment and 18 $0.9 million related to General Corporate. As of December 31, 2003, Cooper had paid $2.7 million for these actions, all of which was for severance costs. A total of 114 salaried and 150 hourly personnel are scheduled to be eliminated as a result of these actions, with 106 personnel having been terminated as of December 31, 2003. The remaining employees are being terminated in the first quarter of 2004. The majority of the remaining severance obligation will be paid in the first half of 2004. The multiple employer pension obligation is expected to be paid over 15 years, beginning in 2005. Cooper estimates the annual savings from the personnel reductions will be approximately $6 million, (net of the anticipated additional employees added in lower cost regions) with most of the savings beginning in the first quarter of 2004. The savings from the withdrawal from the multiple employer pension plan are approximately $1 million per year and are expected to begin in 2005. The majority of the eliminated costs previously were reflected as cost of sales. In 2001, Cooper accrued $35 million reflecting the contractual amount due to financial advisors associated with Coopers strategic alternatives review. Cooper paid $5 million to the advisors in the 2001 fourth quarter and $15.7 million during 2002, leaving a balance of $14.3 million payable upon the occurrence of certain events. During the second quarter of 2003, the terms of the agreements with the financial advisors expired with the contingent events that required payment not occurring. Accordingly, the accrual was reversed and reflected as a $14.3 million negative restructuring charge ($8.6 million, net of taxes) on the consolidated income statement. Restructuring activity for 2003 totaled $2.6 million consisting of the fourth quarter net restructuring charge of $16.9 million, less the $14.3 million negative restructuring charge. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Cooper committed to (1) the closure of ten manufacturing facilities, (2) further employment reductions to appropriately size Coopers workforce to market conditions, and (3) the write off of assets related to production rationalization activities. These actions were taken as a part of Cooper managements ongoing assessment of required production capacity in consideration of the current demand levels. In connection with these commitments, certain production capacity and related assets were sold, outsourced, discontinued or moved to a lower cost environment. Cooper recorded a provision for these announced actions of $39.1 million ($15.0 million of which was non cash), or $29.8 million after taxes ($.32 per diluted common share). Of this amount, $24.0 million ($11.0 million of which was non cash) was associated with the Electrical Products segment, $12.7 million ($3.4 million of which was non cash) was associated with the Tools & Hardware segment and the remainder was related to General Corporate. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper reduced estimates of the cost related to those actions by $1.5 million. Of the $24.1 million of charges resulting in cash expenditures, $2.7 million remained to be expended at December 31, 2003. The following table reflects activity related to the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring charge. Number of Accrued Facilities Closure and Employees Severance Rationalization ($ in millions) 2002 Restructuring Charge............. 1,206 $ 18.3 $ 20.8 Asset write offs...................... (15.0) Employees terminated.................. (184) Cash expenditures..................... (2.1) Balance at December 31, 2002.......... 1,022 16.2 5.8 Employees terminated.................. (982) Cash expenditures..................... (14.9) (2.9) Reversal of excess accruals........... (9) (0.9) (0.6) Balance at December 31, 2003.......... 31 $ 0.4 $ 2.3 19 A total of 435 salaried and 771 hourly positions were scheduled to be eliminated as a result of the planned closure and rationalization actions. Of those planned position eliminations, approximately 600 positions were replaced ultimately as a result of Coopers ongoing efforts to relocate production capacity to lower cost locations. Substantially all of the closure and rationalization activities were initiated by the end of 2003 and are scheduled to be substantially completed by the end of 2004. The expenditures related to the 2002 restructuring charge were funded from cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2003, Cooper anticipates incurring $1.0 million related to facility exit costs and disruption of operations under the 2002 facility closure and production rationalization plan that could not be accrued. These costs are principally related to production inefficiencies and equipment and personnel relocation and will be expensed as incurred. Cooper estimates that the earnings impact in 2003 from these actions was approximately $10 million in pretax savings, the majority of which benefited the second half of the year. These initial savings were realized from personnel reductions that principally impacted selling and administrative expenses and lower cost of sales. Cooper expects that incremental savings of $25.0 to $30.0 million will be realized in 2004, largely reflected as lower cost of sales. During the fourth quarter of 2001, Cooper committed to the consolidation or closure of certain Electrical Products segment facilities and recorded a provision for severance and other related costs of these announced actions of $7.1 million ($1.7 million of which was non cash). Plans to consolidate or close facilities arose as a result of Cooper management continuing to review and modify their assessment of required production and distribution facilities and capacity, in consideration of depressed demand levels. In addition, Cooper concluded during 2001 that various Electrical Products segment assets comprising $8.5 million of net book value were fully impaired as a result of decisions to discontinue or outsource the production provided by those assets in light of demand for the related products. Also during the 2001 fourth quarter, Cooper management performed a strategic review of the operations of the Wiring Devices business. This review focused on the results to date of the combination of the March 2000 acquisition of Eagle Electric with Coopers existing electrical wiring devices operations. Management concluded that certain products within the combined Wiring Devices business were essentially duplicative; that other product offerings were forecasted to be unprofitable; that all product and product packaging should be rebranded to a single brand; and that certain customer changeover costs incurred would provide no future benefit to the Wiring Devices business. Cooper recorded a non cash charge of $8.4 million to provide for these assimilation and changeover costs. The 2001 fourth quarter restructuring charge for the Electrical Products segment totaled $24.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2001, Cooper reviewed strategies surrounding certain information technology related investments. These investments included capitalized costs for software applications, related hardware and equity investments in technology ventures that were primarily related to Coopers efforts regarding the development of electronic sales, engineering and purchasing capabilities. Cooper concluded that a $14.1 million General Corporate restructuring charge should be recorded to provide for the full impairment of certain modules of software, hardware and other technology investments that would not become a functional component of Coopers overall information technology infrastructure. On August 1, 2001, Danaher Corporation ("Danaher") announced it had made an unsolicited proposal to Cooper for a merger through a stock and cash transaction subject to conducting due diligence procedures. On August 8, 2001, Coopers Board of Directors unanimously rejected Danahers proposal and authorized management to explore all strategic alternatives that would maximize shareholder value including mergers, sales, strategic alliances, acquisitions or other similar strategic alternatives. During the 2001 fourth quarter, Cooper recorded a General Corporate restructuring charge of $35.0 million for the fees and expenses of financial advisors and $1.0 million for legal and other external costs associated with performing the strategic alternatives review. On February 13, 2002, Cooper announced that it completed its strategic alternatives review process. After careful review of all the available alternatives with management and its financial advisors, Coopers Board of Directors concluded that it was in the best interests of Coopers shareholders to move forward with its plan to reincorporate in Bermuda. The 2001 fourth quarter general corporate restructuring charge totaled $50.1 million. 20 The restructuring charges for 2001 total $74.1 million, or $44.5 million after taxes ($.47 per diluted share). Of the total $74.1 million, $32.7 million represented non cash charges. During the fourth quarter of 1998, Cooper initiated and announced a voluntary and involuntary severance program and committed to consolidate several facilities. Cooper accrued a total of $26.4 million in severance and $16.1 million in other charges including facility exit costs during the fourth quarter of 1998. During the first quarter of 1999, Cooper completed the voluntary severance program and accrued an additional $5.8 million primarily representing the voluntary severance program premium over the severance provided under Coopers established policies. Cooper also accrued $1.5 million related to severance and other costs for facility closures announced during the first quarter of 1999. At December 31, 2000, $5.1 million of the severance accrual and $3.0 million of the facility consolidation accrual remained to be expended. The following table reflects activity related to the fourth quarter 1998, first quarter 1999 and the fourth quarter 2001 severance, facility consolidation and closure and financial advisors and other cost accruals. Facilities Financial Number of Accrued Consolidation Advisors and Employees Severance and Closure Other ($ in millions) Balance at December 31, 2000................ 607 $ 5.1 $ 3.0 $ Employees terminated........................

(14.3) Balance at December 31, 2003................ $ $ $ Cash provided by operating activities was the source for funding the expenditures. During the second quarter of 2003, the terms of the agreements with the financial advisors expired with the contingent events that required payment not occurring. Accordingly, the accrual was reversed and reflected as a $14.3 million negative restructuring charge ($8.6 million, net of taxes) on the consolidated income statement. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges. General Corporate Expense General Corporate expense was $66.1 million in 2003, compared to $36.5 million in 2002. Included in General Corporate expense in 2003 was a $0.9 million restructuring charge and a $14.3 million reversal of a previously accrued restructuring charge. General Corporate expense in 2002 included a $2.4 million restructuring charge. Excluding these charges in both years, General Corporate expense increased $45.4 million in 2003 compared to 2002. During 2002, General Corporate expense was reduced by income of $12.0 million under an agreement with Belden, Inc. ("Belden"). In 1993, Cooper completed an initial public offering of the stock of Belden, formerly a division of Cooper. Under the agreement, Belden and Cooper made an election that increased the tax basis of certain Belden assets. Belden is required to pay Cooper ninety percent of the amount by which Belden has actually reduced tax payments that would otherwise have been payable if the increase in the tax basis of assets had not occurred, as realized on a quarterly basis over substantially fifteen years. If Belden does not have sufficient future taxable income, it is possible that Belden will not be able to utilize the tax deductions arising from the increases in the tax basis of the assets resulting in a tax loss carryforward. Belden can carry any loss forward twenty years to 21 offset future taxable income. Cooper concluded that, for 2003, no income should be recognized under the agreement. Also, in 2003 Cooper made a discretionary $12.0 million contribution to the Cooper Industries Foundation, which will be used to fulfill commitments to match future employee contributions to non profit organizations and corporate contributions. No such discretionary contribution was made in 2002. The remaining General Corporate expense increase resulted primarily from increased employee benefit related expenses, pension expense and stock based compensation expense. General Corporate expenses decreased to $36.5 million in 2002 from $80.5 million in 2001 due to a reduction in restructuring charges to $2.4 million in 2002 from $50.1 million in 2001. Excluding these restructuring charges in both years, General Corporate expenses increased $3.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Increases in expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits were significant contributors to the increase in 2002. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $0.4 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Higher average interest rates on lower average debt balances resulted in an increase in interest expense that was offset by an increase in interest income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances. Average debt balances were $1.34 billion and $1.40 billion and average interest rates were 5.82% and 5.37% for 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in average interest rates primarily resulted from Coopers replacement in 2002 of substantially all variable rate commercial paper borrowings with long term fixed rate debt. During August 2003, Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert $300 million of 5.25% long term fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91% (with semi annual reset). The notional principal amount and maturity dates of the interest rate swaps match the underlying long term debt. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Cooper recognized a $2.4 million reduction of interest expense, net related to the interest rate swaps. Interest expense, net decreased $10.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of lower average debt balances and average interest rates. Average debt balances were $1.40 billion and $1.56 billion and average interest rates were 5.37% and 5.46% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest Income on Tax Refund During October 2003, Cooper received a refund of $75.9 million for certain claims relating to tax years prior to 1994. The refund included interest of $28.6 million. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for 2003 was 20.8% compared to 23.7% for 2002. The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for 2001 was 17.4%. The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations decreased in 2003 when compared to 2002, primarily as a result of full year effect of the reorganization as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Items affecting the comparability of the 2001 effective tax rate include goodwill amortization, restructuring charges and a $50 million tax benefit due to the reversal of reserves as a result of favorable Appellate level third party court decisions related to certain income tax return issues. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Charge Related to Discontinued Operations A $30 million charge, net of a $20 million income tax benefit, was recorded in 2001 related to potential asbestos obligations regarding the Automotive Products segment which was sold in 1998. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper concluded that an additional $126.0 million charge, net of a $70.9 million income tax benefit, was required in order to adjust the existing accrual to an amount that will be within the likely range of outcomes. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Diluted Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.92 in 2003, $2.28 in 2002 and $2.75 in 2001. 22 PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Cost of Sales: Electrical Products............................................. 69.9% 71.2% 70.2% Tools & Hardware................................................ 74.9% 75.0% 71.1% Selling and Administrative: Electrical Products............................................. 17.2% 16.7% 15.8% Tools & Hardware................................................ 19.5% 20.7% 18.2% 2003 vs. 2002 Percentage of Revenues Electrical Products segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, for 2003 decreased 1.3 points compared to 2002. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage was primarily a result of the continued focus on adjusting Coopers cost structure and productivity improvements. Tools & Hardware segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 0.1 points in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage reflects the benefits of cost reduction programs, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of lower margin assembly equipment shipments and costs incurred as the cost reduction programs were implemented. Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2003 were 17.2% compared to 16.7% for 2002. The increase in the selling and administrative expenses percentage is attributable to higher employee benefits related costs, higher insurance costs and increased sales and marketing costs resulting from initiatives to expand market share, partially offset by benefits from the 2002 cost reduction programs. Tools & Hardware segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 19.5% compared to 20.7% for 2002. The decrease in the selling and administrative expenses percentage reflects increased leveraging of costs partially offset by a modest increase in expenses, particularly related to employee benefits. 2002 vs. 2001 Percentage of Revenues Electrical Products segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, increased 1.0 points in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in the cost of sales percentage was due to pricing pressures and lower absorption of manufacturing costs as a result of efforts to reduce inventories. Tools & Hardware segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, increased 3.9 points for 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in the cost of sales percentage was due to lower absorption of production costs and inefficiencies associated with adjusting manufacturing levels to achieve planned inventory reductions. Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2002 were 16.7% compared to 15.8% for 2001. Total Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses were up slightly, reflecting increased investments in strategic growth programs, while revenues declined, driving the overall percentage increase. Tools & Hardware segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2002 increased 2.5 points over 2001. The increase in selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was directly attributable to the reduction in revenues as total expenses were comparable to 2001. Cooper realizes certain costs and proceeds that are not directly attributable to the operating segments. These items are reflected as General Corporate expenses. See the "General Corporate Expense" section above. 23 EARNINGS OUTLOOK The following sets forth Coopers general business outlook for 2004 based on current expectations. Cooper expects modest growth in revenues for Electrical Products in 2004 through new product introductions and market penetration. In the Tools & Hardware segment, Cooper expects revenue growth through new product introductions and market penetration to approximately offset the anticipated decline in the high levels of assembly equipment sales experienced in 2003. Operating earnings are expected to grow more rapidly than revenues as a result of cost reduction programs and leveraging of fixed costs. Diluted continuing earnings per share is expected to range from approximately $3.15 to $3.30 for 2004. The above statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The above statements are based on a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The primary economic assumptions include, without limitation: (1) slow growth in the domestic and international economies; (2) no significant change in raw material or energy costs; (3) realization of benefits of cost reduction programs (including implementing an Enterprise Business System) with no major disruptions from those programs currently underway; and (4) no significant adverse changes in the relationship of the U.S. dollar to the currencies of countries in which Cooper does business. The estimates also assume, without limitation, no significant change in competitive conditions and such other risk factors as are discussed from time to time in Coopers periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. PRICING AND VOLUME In each of Coopers segments, the nature of many of the products sold is such that an accurate determination of the changes in unit volume of sales is neither practical nor, in some cases, meaningful. Each segment produces a family of products, within which there exist considerable variations in size, configuration and other characteristics. It is Coopers judgment that unit volume in the Electrical Products segment was relatively unchanged and increased in the Tools & Hardware segment in 2003. During the three year period ending December 31, 2003, Cooper was unable to increase prices to fully offset cost increases in selected product offerings in both segments. Cooper has been able to control costs through strategic sourcing efforts, manufacturing improvements and other actions during this period so that the inability to increase prices has not significantly affected profitability in the segments. EFFECT OF INFLATION During each year, inflation has had a relatively minor effect on Coopers results of operations. In recent years, the rate of inflation in Coopers primary markets has been low overall. Cooper actively manages material costs and has achieved cost reductions in each of the last three years, which has mitigated increases in employee compensation and benefits. Due to depressed market conditions over the past three years, inflation of sales prices has been limited to specific products with overall pricing declining in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. 24 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL For purposes of this discussion, operating working capital is defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable. Coopers operating working capital decreased $13 million to $962 million in 2003 compared to $975 million in 2002. The decrease in operating working capital for 2003 was due to a $29 million reduction in inventories and a $17 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a $32 million increase in accounts receivable. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annual revenues divided by average operating working capital) for 2003 was 4.2 turns, increasing from 3.9 turns in 2002, due to continued focus on improving the efficient use of working capital, particularly lowering inventory levels. A portion of the reduction in inventories was due to a $7 million increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. Coopers operating working capital decreased $72 million to $975 million in 2002 from $1,047 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily related to a $90 million reduction in inventories and a $70 million reduction in accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable. Contributing to the reduction in inventories was a $6 million increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories reflecting Coopers assessment of ultimate disposition in consideration of market conditions. Operating working capital turnover decreased to 3.9 turns in 2002 from 4.0 turns in 2001. The decrease from 2001 reflects the impact of lower shipments. Coopers operating working capital decreased $19 million to $1,047 million in 2001 from $1,066 million in 2000. Operating working capital turnover declined to 4.0 turns in 2001 from 4.5 turns in 2000. The impact of recent acquisitions increased operating working capital turnover in 2001 by .2 turns. The decrease from 2000 primarily reflects the lower than expected revenues experienced in 2001. CASH FLOWS Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 totaled $445 million. These funds, along with $63 million of cash received from employee stock plan activity, were used to fund capital expenditures of $80 million, dividends of $130 million and net debt repayments of $170 million and resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $162 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 totaled $480 million. These funds, along with a net $95 million of additional debt, partially offset by capital expenditures of $74 million, dividends of $130 million and share purchases of $94 million, resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $291 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2001 totaled $422 million. These funds, along with $41 million in cash received from employee stock plan activity, were used to fund capital expenditures of $115 million, dividends of $131 million, share repurchases of $42 million, and a net reduction of debt of $206 million. In connection with accounting for acquisitions, Cooper records, to the extent appropriate, accruals for the costs of closing duplicate facilities, severing redundant personnel and integrating the acquired businesses into existing Cooper operations. At December 31, 2003, Cooper had accruals totaling $18.1 million related to these activities. Cash flows from operating activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, is reduced by the amounts expended on the various accruals established in connection with each acquisition. Cooper spent $11.0 million, $7.2 million and $11.0 million on these integration activities in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 25 Cooper currently anticipates a continuance of its long term ability to annually generate approximately $200 million in cash flow available for acquisitions, debt repayment and common stock repurchases. As discussed in Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Cooper is continuing negotiations with the representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants regarding settlement of Coopers contingent liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale to Federal Mogul. It is likely that if a settlement is reached, the settlement would involve a cash contribution. Cooper anticipates that any settlement cash contribution amounts would be funded from operating cash flows. DEBT Cooper typically relies on the commercial paper market as its principal source of short term financing. As of December 31, 2001, Coopers outstanding commercial paper balance was $342 million. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Cooper had no commercial paper outstanding and cash and cash equivalents of $463.7 million and $302.0 million, respectively. Coopers practice is to back up its outstanding commercial paper with a combination of cash and committed bank credit facilities. As of December 31, 2003, the balance of these committed bank credit facilities was $450 million, which matures on November 17, 2004. Outstanding commercial paper balances, to the extent not backed up by cash, reduce the amount of available borrowings under the committed bank credit facilities. The credit facility agreements do not contain a material adverse change clause. The principal financial covenants in the agreements limit Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio to 60% and require Cooper to maintain a minimum earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest ratio of 3 to 1. Cooper is in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit facility agreements. Coopers access to the commercial paper market could be adversely affected by a change in the credit ratings assigned to its commercial paper. Should Coopers access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in its credit ratings, Cooper would rely on a combination of available cash and its committed bank credit facilities to provide short term funding. The committed bank credit facilities do not contain any provision which makes their availability to Cooper dependent on Coopers credit ratings. During June 2002, Coopers subsidiary, Cooper Industries, Inc. ("Cooper Ohio"), issued $300 million senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2007 with a 5.25% interest rate. Proceeds from the notes were used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances. During September 2002, Cooper Ohio filed a Form S 4 Registration Statement to exchange the original notes for notes with substantially identical terms, except that the exchange notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the transfer restrictions and registration rights applicable to the original notes do not apply to the exchange notes. The original and exchange notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Cooper. The exchange offer was completed on November 4, 2002 with all holders exchanging their notes. Cooper Ohio did not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer. During August 2003, Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert $300 million of 5.25% long term fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91% (with semi annual reset). The swaps mature concurrent with the long term debt and have been designated as fair value hedges. During 1999, Cooper Ohio completed a shelf registration to issue up to $500 million of debt securities. On October 28, 2002, Cooper Ohio issued $275 million senior unsecured notes due November 1, 2009, with a 5.5% interest rate. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay short term debt and other maturing indebtedness in 2002 and current maturities of long term debt in 2003. The notes are fully and 26 unconditionally guaranteed by Cooper. After this issuance, $225 million of the shelf registration remains available. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Cooper executes stand by letters of credit, performance bonds and other guarantees in the normal course of business that ensure Coopers performance or payments to third parties. The aggregate notional value of these instruments was $99.9 million at December 31, 2003. Sixty nine percent of these instruments have an expiration date within one year. In the past, no significant claims have been made against these financial instruments. Management believes the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expects no material cash outlays to occur in connection with these instruments. The following table summarizes Coopers contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due Four to After Less than One to Five Five Contractual Obligations: Total One Year Three Years Years Years (in millions) Long Term Debt $ 1,337.1 $ 0.4 $ 645.8 $ 405.9 $ 285.0 Short Term Debt 6.2 6.2 Noncancellable Operating Leases 106.7 23.9 39.8 26.4 16.6 Purchase Obligations 178.4 173.6 4.8 Other Long Term Liabilities(1) 278.5 18.4 36.8 36.2 187.1 $ 1,906.9 $ 222.5 $ 727.2 $ 468.5 $ 488.7 (1) Includes unfunded other postretirement benefit obligations, unfunded foreign defined benefit pension plan liabilities, other postemployment benefit liabilities and environmental liabilities. CAPITALIZATION During the first quarter of 2000, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to five million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2003, there were approximately 2.3 million shares available for repurchase under this authorization. Cooper has targeted a 35% to 45% debt to total capitalization ratio and intends to utilize cash flows to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio within this range. Excess cash flows are utilized to purchase shares of Coopers Common stock or fund acquisitions. At December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio was 38.8%, 41.8% and 39.1%, respectively. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND COMMITMENTS Capital expenditures on projects to reduce product costs, improve product quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and operating flexibility, or expand production capacity were $80 million in 2003, $74 million in 2002 and $115 million in 2001. Capital expenditures decreased during 2002 and 2001 compared to the prior year, as Cooper completed several significant projects and focused on maximizing cash generation from its operations. Accordingly, Coopers businesses concentrated on completing open projects and investing only in operationally necessary new projects. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $100 to $110 million in 2004. Projected expenditures for 2004 will focus on development of new products, the implementation of new business systems and cost reduction programs. 27 INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates affect Coopers earnings and cash flows. As a result of having sales, purchases and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies used by Coopers businesses, Cooper is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on its cash flows and earnings. Cooper enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant foreign currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions. Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year. The table below provides information about Coopers derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments at December 31, 2003 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, information on foreign denominated debt obligations that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates is presented. For debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates. The information is presented in U.S. Dollar equivalents. The actual cash flows are denominated in U.S. Dollars, Euros and British Pound Sterling as indicated in parentheses. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. The average pay rate on interest rate swaps is based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of December 31, 2003. 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total ($ in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate (U.S. Dollar) $ 0.4 $ 229.9 $ 11.4 $ 300.4 $ 100.3 $ 277.0 $ 919.4 Average interest rate 5.8% 5.8% 5.5% 5.6% 5.6% 5.5% 5.8% Fixed rate (Euro) $ $ 374.6 $ $ $ $ $ 374.6 Average interest rate 6.3% 6.3% 6.3% Variable rate (GBP) $ $ 29.9 $ $ $ $ $ 29.9 Average interest rate 3.6% 3.6% 3.6% Variable rate (U.S. Dollar) $ $ $ $ $ $ 8.0 $ 8.0 Average interest rate 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% Interest rate swaps: Fixed to variable: Notional amount(1) $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ $ $ 300.0 Average pay rate 3.34% 4.81% 5.95% 6.46% 4.95% Average receive rate 5.25% 5.25% 5.25% 5.25% 5.25% (1) Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert its fixed rate $300 million senior unsecured debt due in July 2007 to variable rate debt. 28 The table below provides information about Coopers foreign currency forward exchange contracts to purchase currencies in excess of $5 million at December 31, 2003.

During 2002, Cooper sold at a premium U.S. Treasury securities due August 15, 2003 with a face amount of $750 million. Cooper obtained these securities pursuant to a repurchase agreement containing provisions that limited Coopers interest rate exposure under this agreement to a maximum amount of $7.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Cooper settled the interest rate exposure with a cash payment of $7.0 million which was funded with cash provided by operating activities. During 2001, Cooper sold at a premium U.S. Treasury securities due November 2002 with a face amount of $1.0 billion. Cooper obtained these securities pursuant to a repurchase agreement containing provisions that limited Coopers interest rate exposure under this agreement to a maximum amount of $7.0 million. During the second quarter of 2002, Cooper settled the interest rate exposure with a cash payment of $6.0 million, which was funded with cash provided by operating activities. The repurchase agreements were settled immediately prior to the maturity of the securities. Settlement of these transactions did not require any financing by Cooper and the transactions did not create an asset or liability, other than as described above. Also during 2001, Cooper purchased at a discount Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Notes due February 2003 and immediately transferred these notes pursuant to a securities loan agreement. Subsequently, Cooper eliminated any interest rate exposure under the securities loan agreement and received a cash payment of approximately $1.9 million upon maturity of the notes. The securities loan agreement was settled immediately prior to the maturity of the notes. Settlement of this transaction will not require any financing by Cooper and this transaction did not create a liability. The face amount of the notes was $480 million. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the fair value of Coopers financial instruments.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by this Item is included under "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes certain forward looking statements. The forward looking statements reflect Coopers expectations, objectives and goals with respect to future events and financial performance, and are based on assumptions and estimates which Cooper believes are reasonable. Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the facilities closure and production rationalization plan and cost reduction programs (including implementation of an Enterprise Business System), resolution of income tax matters, potential liability exposure resulting from Federal Mogul Corporations ("Federal Mogul") bankruptcy filing and any statements regarding future revenues, costs and expenses, earnings, earnings per share, margins, cash flows and capital expenditures. Cooper wishes to caution readers not to put undue reliance on these statements and that actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Important factors which may affect the actual results include, but are not limited to, the resolution of Federal Moguls bankruptcy proceedings, political developments, market and economic conditions, changes in raw material and energy costs, industry competition, the net effects of Coopers cost reduction programs, the timing and net effects of facility closures and the magnitude of any disruptions from such closures, changes in mix of products sold, mergers and acquisitions and their integration into Cooper, the timing and amount of any stock repurchases by Cooper, changes in financial markets including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changing legislation and regulations including changes in tax law, tax treaties or tax regulations. The forward looking statements contained in this report are intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Cooper believes the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts. Cooper recognizes revenues when products are shipped and accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience. If actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, additional allowances may be required. The accrual for sales returns and other allowances was $33.8 million and $27.2 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Allowances for excess and obsolete inventory are provided based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances may be required. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $47.6 million at December 31, 2003 and $41.0 million at December 31, 2002. Cooper had a valuation allowance of $21.7 million at December 31, 2002 to reduce its deferred tax asset related to a capital loss carryforward on the 1998 sale of the Automotive Products segment. The capital loss carryforward was available to offset capital gains through 2003. The capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset balance was $21.7 million at December 31, 2002. Cooper limited the amount of tax benefits recognizable from this asset based on an evaluation of the amount of capital loss carryforward that was expected to be realized. Cooper implemented strategies to realize the capital loss carryforward asset and reclassified the reduction in the valuation allowance to other tax liabilities in 2003. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, discount rates and estimated future 13 employee earnings and demographics. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Differences between actuarial assumptions and estimates and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of a calculated minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service period of active employees. Declining interest rates resulted in a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure plan obligations from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.25% in 2003. The decrease in the discount rate caused an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation amount. During 2001 and 2002, the fair market value of the equity investments included in pension plan assets decreased significantly, primarily as a result of the overall downturn in the U.S. stock market. The accumulated benefit obligation of certain plans exceeded the fair market value of plan assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002. This unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, plus the existing prepaid asset resulted in a $22.9 million and $33.4 million net of tax minimum pension liability charge included in accumulated other nonowner changes in equity at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total net periodic pension benefits cost was $28.7 million in 2003, $16.7 million in 2002 and $11.6 million in 2001. The increase in net periodic pension cost in 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in the expected return on plan assets and an increase in recognized actuarial losses. Total net periodic pension benefits cost is currently expected to approximate $25.0 million in 2004. The net periodic pension benefit cost for 2004 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 6.25% and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5%. The expected decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily results from 2002 and 2003 pension plan contributions and increased returns on plan assets, as the U.S. stock market recovered in 2003. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The postretirement benefits other than pensions liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of postretirement benefits expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of a minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the participants. The decline in interest rates over the past three years resulted in a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure postretirement benefit obligations from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.25% in 2003. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost is expected to decrease slightly to $5.5 million in 2004 compared to $5.8 million in 2003, $5.2 million in 2002 and income of $1.3 million in 2001. The increase in net periodic postretirement benefit cost in 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of recognized actuarial gains. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites owned by Cooper and third party sites where Cooper was determined to be a potentially responsible party. Third party sites frequently involve multiple potentially responsible parties and Coopers potential liability is determined based on estimates of Coopers proportionate responsibility for the total cleanup. The amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates as well as an assessment of the financial capacity of the other potentially responsible parties. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, Coopers estimate of its environmental liabilities may change. The liability for environmental remediation was $38.9 million at December 31, 2003 and $42.2 million at December 31, 2002. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper revised the accrual that represents its best estimate of liabilities related to the sale of the Automotive Products business to Federal Mogul in 1998. During the three year period ending December 31, 2003, Cooper accounted for payments made to settle asbestos related cases by reducing the accrual. Subsequent proceeds from insurance claims for these settlements would increase the accrual. The liabilities include potential liabilities in the event Federal Mogul rejects the 1998 Purchase 14 and Sale Agreement for the sale of the Automotive Products business and certain indemnification obligations to Cooper. The analysis of Coopers contingent liability exposure for asbestos related claims involving Abex products was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2001 with assistance from independent advisors, Bates White, LLC, and assumed future resolution of the Abex related asbestos claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceeding. The analysis included a review of the twenty year history of Abex claims; the average indemnity payments for resolved claims; the jurisdictions in which claims had been filed; Bates White, LLC data on the incidence of asbestos exposure and diseases in various industries; existing insurance coverage including the insurance recovered by Pneumo Abex Corporation and Federal Mogul for pre bankruptcy claims and the contractual indemnities. Assumptions were made regarding future claim filings and indemnity payments, and, based on advisors data, the expected population of persons exposed to asbestos in particular industries. All of this data was used to determine a reasonable expectation of future claims, indemnity payments and insurance coverage. As discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, throughout 2003, Cooper worked towards resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. This included negotiations with representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants ("Representatives") regarding participation in Federal Moguls proposed 524(g) asbestos trust. Coopers fourth quarter 2001 analysis of the contingent liability exposure assumed that the liabilities would be settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. This analysis assumed that the Representatives would reach similar conclusions regarding the potential future liabilities and insurance recoveries as Cooper did based on the Bates White, LLC analysis. Based on the status of the negotiations during 2004, Cooper concluded that it is probable that Federal Mogul will reject the 1998 Agreement. Cooper also concluded that the Representatives would require any negotiated settlement through the Federal Mogul bankruptcy to be at the high end of the Bates White, LLC liability analysis and with substantially lower insurance recovery assumptions and higher administrative costs. While Cooper believes that the insurance has significant additional value, extensive litigation with the insurance carriers may be required to receive recoveries and there is risk that court decisions could reduce the value of the recoveries. Additionally, the assumptions on liability payments could prove inaccurate over time. If Cooper is unable to reach a settlement with the Representatives and the 1998 Agreement is rejected, Cooper would be required to reflect an accrual for the total estimated liability and a receivable for the probable insurance recoveries. Generally accepted accounting principles provide relatively conservative requirements for the recording of insurance recoveries and a substantial portion of the potential insurance recoveries would not be reflected as receivables until future events occur. During late February and early March 2004, Cooper reassessed the accrual required based on the current status of the negotiations with the Representatives and the liability and insurance receivable that would be required to be recorded if this matter is not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper concluded that resolution within the Federal Mogul proposed 524(g) asbestos trust would likely be within the range of the liabilities, net of insurance recoveries, that Cooper would accrue if this matter were not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Accordingly, Cooper recorded a $126.0 million after tax discontinued operations charge in the fourth quarter of 2003. Cooper is continuing negotiations with the Representatives. At this time, the manner in which this issue will be resolved is not known. At December 31, 2003, the accrual for potential liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale and the Federal Mogul bankruptcy was $252.5 million. 15 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REVENUES Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Electrical Products......................... $ 3,358.4 $ 3,324.9 $ 3,485.5 Tools & Hardware............................ 703.0 635.6 724.0 Total Revenues......................... $ 4,061.4 $ 3,960.5 $ 4,209.5 See the geographic information included in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of revenues by country. 2003 vs. 2002 Revenues Revenues increased 3% in 2003 compared to 2002. Foreign currency translation increased total 2003 revenues by approximately 2%. Electrical Products revenues for 2003, which represent 83% of total revenues, increased 1% over 2002. Foreign currency translation increased Electrical Products revenues by approximately 2%. Modest sequential improvement in industrial and electronic markets, plus the benefits of Coopers new product development and market penetration programs resulted in revenue gains in the hazardous duty, circuit protection and wiring devices businesses. Coopers lighting fixtures business was up slightly, as an improvement in commercial and industrial markets was offset by the impact of inventory management initiatives within the retail channel. Coopers support systems business continued to be pressured by weak non residential and telecommunications markets. Controls over discretionary spending by utilities negatively impacted the power transmission and distribution equipment market. Coopers European lighting and security business, absent favorable currency translation, experienced slightly reduced sales compared to the prior year. Tools & Hardware segment revenues, which contributed 17% to total 2003 revenues, were 11% higher than 2002. Power tools experienced growth in European based industrial power tools and assembly equipment markets. Hand tools sales improved over the prior year primarily as a result of increased demand from the retail channel, driven by new product offerings. A weak U.S. Dollar increased total Tools & Hardware revenues during 2003 by approximately 5%. 2002 vs. 2001 Revenues Revenues decreased 6% in 2002 compared to 2001. Foreign currency translation had an insignificant impact on revenues during 2002 in both business segments. Weak industrial markets worldwide affected demand across all of Coopers businesses. Electrical Products segment revenues, which represent 84% of 2002 total revenues, were 5% below 2001. Continued weakness in the North American economy affected the markets served by the Electrical Products segment. A contraction in domestic industrial activity and commercial construction impacted demand and increased price pressures for Coopers lighting, hazardous duty and support systems products. The impact of these weak markets was partially offset by strong retail channel sales, particularly for Coopers residential lighting and wiring devices products. An uncertain economic environment for utility customers reduced sales of electrical distribution equipment. A modest recovery in the electronics markets led to an increase in sales of circuit protection products. The Tools & Hardware segment contributed 16% of total revenues in 2002. Revenues for 2002 were 12% below 2001. Worldwide demand was weak for both hand tools and power tools used in general industrial and electronics markets. Shipments of automotive assembly equipment were lower than the prior year as a result of reduced capital spending by automotive companies. 16 OPERATING RESULTS Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (in millions, except per share data) Electrical Products............................................ $ 418.7 $ 376.6 $ 413.0 Tools & Hardware............................................... 39.4 14.6 68.6 Total Segment Operating Earnings.......................... 458.1 391.2 481.6 General Corporate Expense...................................... 66.1 36.5 80.5 Operating Earnings............................................. 392.0 354.7 401.1 Interest Expense, net.......................................... 74.1 74.5 84.7 Interest Income on Tax Refund..................................

All costs directly attributable to operating businesses are included in segment operating earnings. Corporate overhead costs, including costs of traditional headquarters activities, such as treasury, are not allocated to the businesses. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cooper adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142") on January 1, 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 17 2003 vs. 2002 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $458.1 million in 2003, compared to $391.2 million in 2002. Electrical Products segment 2003 operating earnings were $418.7 million compared to $376.6 million for 2002. Return on revenues was 12.5% in 2003, compared to 11.3% in 2002. Included in the Electrical Products segment earnings were restructuring charges in 2003 and 2002 totalling $16.4 million and $24.0 million, respectively. Excluding the restructuring charges in both years, the increase in Electrical Products segment earnings was primarily due to the improvement in margins as a result of cost reduction and productivity actions targeting manufacturing costs. The favorable impact of these actions was partially offset by increased insurance, pension and employee benefit expenses and investments in sales and marketing initiatives. Tools & Hardware segment operating earnings were $39.4 million for 2003, compared to $14.6 million for 2002. Return on revenues was 5.6% in 2003, compared to 2.3% in 2002. Included in Tools & Hardware segment earnings for 2003 was a net $0.4 million favorable adjustment reflecting the reversal of excess 2002 restructuring charges partially offset by 2003 restructuring charges. Tools & Hardware segment earnings for 2002 included restructuring charges of $12.7 million. Absent the impact of restructuring charges in both years, the increase in Tools & Hardware segment earnings largely reflects the increase in revenues and the impact of Coopers cost control and manufacturing rationalization efforts, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and higher insurance, pension and employee benefit expenses. 2002 vs. 2001 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings decreased to $391.2 million in 2002 from $481.6 million in 2001. Electrical Products segment operating earnings decreased to $376.6 million from $413.0 million in 2001. Return on revenues was 11.3% in 2002 compared to 11.8% in 2001. Electrical Products segment operating earnings for 2001 include goodwill amortization of $51.5 million. Included in the Electrical Products segment earnings were restructuring charges of $24.0 million in each year. Excluding these restructuring charges and goodwill amortization, the reduction in segment earnings from the prior year was due to lower revenues reflective of the overall weakness of industrial and non residential construction markets, competitive market conditions, lower absorption of production costs as a result of aggressive actions to reduce inventory levels and investments in strategic growth programs. The Tools & Hardware segment operating earnings were $14.6 million compared to $68.6 million in 2001. Return on revenues was 2.3% in 2002 compared to 9.5% in 2001. Tools & Hardware segment operating earnings for 2001 include goodwill amortization of $9.2 million. Included in Tools & Hardware segment earnings for 2002 were restructuring charges of $12.7 million. Excluding these restructuring charges and goodwill amortization, the lower operating earnings primarily reflect the impact of reduced revenues from the prior year and plant inefficiencies from operating at reduced levels of manufacturing to achieve planned inventory reductions. RESTRUCTURING During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper recorded net restructuring charges of $16.9 million, or $13.6 million after taxes ($.14 per diluted common share). This represented costs associated with restructuring projects undertaken in 2003 of $18.4 million, partially offset by a $1.5 million adjustment of estimates for restructuring projects initiated in 2002. The most significant action included in the charges was an announcement of the closing of Cooper Wiring Devices manufacturing operations in New York City. This action will include the withdrawal from a multiple employer pension plan. Cooper recorded a $12.5 million obligation as an estimate of Coopers portion of unfunded benefit obligations of the plan. The remaining $5.9 million charge primarily represents severance for announced employment reductions at several locations. The 2003 net impact of the charges was $16.4 million on the Electrical Products segment, $(0.4) million on the Tools & Hardware segment and 18 $0.9 million related to General Corporate. As of December 31, 2003, Cooper had paid $2.7 million for these actions, all of which was for severance costs. A total of 114 salaried and 150 hourly personnel are scheduled to be eliminated as a result of these actions, with 106 personnel having been terminated as of December 31, 2003. The remaining employees are being terminated in the first quarter of 2004. The majority of the remaining severance obligation will be paid in the first half of 2004. The multiple employer pension obligation is expected to be paid over 15 years, beginning in 2005. Cooper estimates the annual savings from the personnel reductions will be approximately $6 million, (net of the anticipated additional employees added in lower cost regions) with most of the savings beginning in the first quarter of 2004. The savings from the withdrawal from the multiple employer pension plan are approximately $1 million per year and are expected to begin in 2005. The majority of the eliminated costs previously were reflected as cost of sales. In 2001, Cooper accrued $35 million reflecting the contractual amount due to financial advisors associated with Coopers strategic alternatives review. Cooper paid $5 million to the advisors in the 2001 fourth quarter and $15.7 million during 2002, leaving a balance of $14.3 million payable upon the occurrence of certain events. During the second quarter of 2003, the terms of the agreements with the financial advisors expired with the contingent events that required payment not occurring. Accordingly, the accrual was reversed and reflected as a $14.3 million negative restructuring charge ($8.6 million, net of taxes) on the consolidated income statement. Restructuring activity for 2003 totaled $2.6 million consisting of the fourth quarter net restructuring charge of $16.9 million, less the $14.3 million negative restructuring charge. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Cooper committed to (1) the closure of ten manufacturing facilities, (2) further employment reductions to appropriately size Coopers workforce to market conditions, and (3) the write off of assets related to production rationalization activities. These actions were taken as a part of Cooper managements ongoing assessment of required production capacity in consideration of the current demand levels. In connection with these commitments, certain production capacity and related assets were sold, outsourced, discontinued or moved to a lower cost environment. Cooper recorded a provision for these announced actions of $39.1 million ($15.0 million of which was non cash), or $29.8 million after taxes ($.32 per diluted common share). Of this amount, $24.0 million ($11.0 million of which was non cash) was associated with the Electrical Products segment, $12.7 million ($3.4 million of which was non cash) was associated with the Tools & Hardware segment and the remainder was related to General Corporate. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper reduced estimates of the cost related to those actions by $1.5 million. Of the $24.1 million of charges resulting in cash expenditures, $2.7 million remained to be expended at December 31, 2003. The following table reflects activity related to the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring charge. Number of Accrued Facilities Closure and Employees Severance Rationalization ($ in millions) 2002 Restructuring Charge............. 1,206 $ 18.3 $ 20.8 Asset write offs...................... (15.0) Employees terminated.................. (184) Cash expenditures..................... (2.1) Balance at December 31, 2002.......... 1,022 16.2 5.8 Employees terminated.................. (982) Cash expenditures..................... (14.9) (2.9) Reversal of excess accruals........... (9) (0.9) (0.6) Balance at December 31, 2003.......... 31 $ 0.4 $ 2.3 19 A total of 435 salaried and 771 hourly positions were scheduled to be eliminated as a result of the planned closure and rationalization actions. Of those planned position eliminations, approximately 600 positions were replaced ultimately as a result of Coopers ongoing efforts to relocate production capacity to lower cost locations. Substantially all of the closure and rationalization activities were initiated by the end of 2003 and are scheduled to be substantially completed by the end of 2004. The expenditures related to the 2002 restructuring charge were funded from cash provided by operating activities. As of December 31, 2003, Cooper anticipates incurring $1.0 million related to facility exit costs and disruption of operations under the 2002 facility closure and production rationalization plan that could not be accrued. These costs are principally related to production inefficiencies and equipment and personnel relocation and will be expensed as incurred. Cooper estimates that the earnings impact in 2003 from these actions was approximately $10 million in pretax savings, the majority of which benefited the second half of the year. These initial savings were realized from personnel reductions that principally impacted selling and administrative expenses and lower cost of sales. Cooper expects that incremental savings of $25.0 to $30.0 million will be realized in 2004, largely reflected as lower cost of sales. During the fourth quarter of 2001, Cooper committed to the consolidation or closure of certain Electrical Products segment facilities and recorded a provision for severance and other related costs of these announced actions of $7.1 million ($1.7 million of which was non cash). Plans to consolidate or close facilities arose as a result of Cooper management continuing to review and modify their assessment of required production and distribution facilities and capacity, in consideration of depressed demand levels. In addition, Cooper concluded during 2001 that various Electrical Products segment assets comprising $8.5 million of net book value were fully impaired as a result of decisions to discontinue or outsource the production provided by those assets in light of demand for the related products. Also during the 2001 fourth quarter, Cooper management performed a strategic review of the operations of the Wiring Devices business. This review focused on the results to date of the combination of the March 2000 acquisition of Eagle Electric with Coopers existing electrical wiring devices operations. Management concluded that certain products within the combined Wiring Devices business were essentially duplicative; that other product offerings were forecasted to be unprofitable; that all product and product packaging should be rebranded to a single brand; and that certain customer changeover costs incurred would provide no future benefit to the Wiring Devices business. Cooper recorded a non cash charge of $8.4 million to provide for these assimilation and changeover costs. The 2001 fourth quarter restructuring charge for the Electrical Products segment totaled $24.0 million. During the fourth quarter of 2001, Cooper reviewed strategies surrounding certain information technology related investments. These investments included capitalized costs for software applications, related hardware and equity investments in technology ventures that were primarily related to Coopers efforts regarding the development of electronic sales, engineering and purchasing capabilities. Cooper concluded that a $14.1 million General Corporate restructuring charge should be recorded to provide for the full impairment of certain modules of software, hardware and other technology investments that would not become a functional component of Coopers overall information technology infrastructure. On August 1, 2001, Danaher Corporation ("Danaher") announced it had made an unsolicited proposal to Cooper for a merger through a stock and cash transaction subject to conducting due diligence procedures. On August 8, 2001, Coopers Board of Directors unanimously rejected Danahers proposal and authorized management to explore all strategic alternatives that would maximize shareholder value including mergers, sales, strategic alliances, acquisitions or other similar strategic alternatives. During the 2001 fourth quarter, Cooper recorded a General Corporate restructuring charge of $35.0 million for the fees and expenses of financial advisors and $1.0 million for legal and other external costs associated with performing the strategic alternatives review. On February 13, 2002, Cooper announced that it completed its strategic alternatives review process. After careful review of all the available alternatives with management and its financial advisors, Coopers Board of Directors concluded that it was in the best interests of Coopers shareholders to move forward with its plan to reincorporate in Bermuda. The 2001 fourth quarter general corporate restructuring charge totaled $50.1 million. 20 The restructuring charges for 2001 total $74.1 million, or $44.5 million after taxes ($.47 per diluted share). Of the total $74.1 million, $32.7 million represented non cash charges. During the fourth quarter of 1998, Cooper initiated and announced a voluntary and involuntary severance program and committed to consolidate several facilities. Cooper accrued a total of $26.4 million in severance and $16.1 million in other charges including facility exit costs during the fourth quarter of 1998. During the first quarter of 1999, Cooper completed the voluntary severance program and accrued an additional $5.8 million primarily representing the voluntary severance program premium over the severance provided under Coopers established policies. Cooper also accrued $1.5 million related to severance and other costs for facility closures announced during the first quarter of 1999. At December 31, 2000, $5.1 million of the severance accrual and $3.0 million of the facility consolidation accrual remained to be expended. The following table reflects activity related to the fourth quarter 1998, first quarter 1999 and the fourth quarter 2001 severance, facility consolidation and closure and financial advisors and other cost accruals. Facilities Financial Number of Accrued Consolidation Advisors and Employees Severance and Closure Other ($ in millions) Balance at December 31, 2000................ 607 $ 5.1 $ 3.0 $ Employees terminated........................

(14.3) Balance at December 31, 2003................ $ $ $ Cash provided by operating activities was the source for funding the expenditures. During the second quarter of 2003, the terms of the agreements with the financial advisors expired with the contingent events that required payment not occurring. Accordingly, the accrual was reversed and reflected as a $14.3 million negative restructuring charge ($8.6 million, net of taxes) on the consolidated income statement. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges. General Corporate Expense General Corporate expense was $66.1 million in 2003, compared to $36.5 million in 2002. Included in General Corporate expense in 2003 was a $0.9 million restructuring charge and a $14.3 million reversal of a previously accrued restructuring charge. General Corporate expense in 2002 included a $2.4 million restructuring charge. Excluding these charges in both years, General Corporate expense increased $45.4 million in 2003 compared to 2002. During 2002, General Corporate expense was reduced by income of $12.0 million under an agreement with Belden, Inc. ("Belden"). In 1993, Cooper completed an initial public offering of the stock of Belden, formerly a division of Cooper. Under the agreement, Belden and Cooper made an election that increased the tax basis of certain Belden assets. Belden is required to pay Cooper ninety percent of the amount by which Belden has actually reduced tax payments that would otherwise have been payable if the increase in the tax basis of assets had not occurred, as realized on a quarterly basis over substantially fifteen years. If Belden does not have sufficient future taxable income, it is possible that Belden will not be able to utilize the tax deductions arising from the increases in the tax basis of the assets resulting in a tax loss carryforward. Belden can carry any loss forward twenty years to 21 offset future taxable income. Cooper concluded that, for 2003, no income should be recognized under the agreement. Also, in 2003 Cooper made a discretionary $12.0 million contribution to the Cooper Industries Foundation, which will be used to fulfill commitments to match future employee contributions to non profit organizations and corporate contributions. No such discretionary contribution was made in 2002. The remaining General Corporate expense increase resulted primarily from increased employee benefit related expenses, pension expense and stock based compensation expense. General Corporate expenses decreased to $36.5 million in 2002 from $80.5 million in 2001 due to a reduction in restructuring charges to $2.4 million in 2002 from $50.1 million in 2001. Excluding these restructuring charges in both years, General Corporate expenses increased $3.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Increases in expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits were significant contributors to the increase in 2002. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $0.4 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Higher average interest rates on lower average debt balances resulted in an increase in interest expense that was offset by an increase in interest income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances. Average debt balances were $1.34 billion and $1.40 billion and average interest rates were 5.82% and 5.37% for 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in average interest rates primarily resulted from Coopers replacement in 2002 of substantially all variable rate commercial paper borrowings with long term fixed rate debt. During August 2003, Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert $300 million of 5.25% long term fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91% (with semi annual reset). The notional principal amount and maturity dates of the interest rate swaps match the underlying long term debt. During the year ended December 31, 2003, Cooper recognized a $2.4 million reduction of interest expense, net related to the interest rate swaps. Interest expense, net decreased $10.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily as a result of lower average debt balances and average interest rates. Average debt balances were $1.40 billion and $1.56 billion and average interest rates were 5.37% and 5.46% for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest Income on Tax Refund During October 2003, Cooper received a refund of $75.9 million for certain claims relating to tax years prior to 1994. The refund included interest of $28.6 million. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for 2003 was 20.8% compared to 23.7% for 2002. The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for 2001 was 17.4%. The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations decreased in 2003 when compared to 2002, primarily as a result of full year effect of the reorganization as discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Items affecting the comparability of the 2001 effective tax rate include goodwill amortization, restructuring charges and a $50 million tax benefit due to the reversal of reserves as a result of favorable Appellate level third party court decisions related to certain income tax return issues. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Charge Related to Discontinued Operations A $30 million charge, net of a $20 million income tax benefit, was recorded in 2001 related to potential asbestos obligations regarding the Automotive Products segment which was sold in 1998. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper concluded that an additional $126.0 million charge, net of a $70.9 million income tax benefit, was required in order to adjust the existing accrual to an amount that will be within the likely range of outcomes. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Diluted Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.92 in 2003, $2.28 in 2002 and $2.75 in 2001. 22 PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Cost of Sales: Electrical Products............................................. 69.9% 71.2% 70.2% Tools & Hardware................................................ 74.9% 75.0% 71.1% Selling and Administrative: Electrical Products............................................. 17.2% 16.7% 15.8% Tools & Hardware................................................ 19.5% 20.7% 18.2% 2003 vs. 2002 Percentage of Revenues Electrical Products segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, for 2003 decreased 1.3 points compared to 2002. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage was primarily a result of the continued focus on adjusting Coopers cost structure and productivity improvements. Tools & Hardware segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 0.1 points in 2003 compared to 2002. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage reflects the benefits of cost reduction programs, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of lower margin assembly equipment shipments and costs incurred as the cost reduction programs were implemented. Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2003 were 17.2% compared to 16.7% for 2002. The increase in the selling and administrative expenses percentage is attributable to higher employee benefits related costs, higher insurance costs and increased sales and marketing costs resulting from initiatives to expand market share, partially offset by benefits from the 2002 cost reduction programs. Tools & Hardware segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 19.5% compared to 20.7% for 2002. The decrease in the selling and administrative expenses percentage reflects increased leveraging of costs partially offset by a modest increase in expenses, particularly related to employee benefits. 2002 vs. 2001 Percentage of Revenues Electrical Products segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, increased 1.0 points in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in the cost of sales percentage was due to pricing pressures and lower absorption of manufacturing costs as a result of efforts to reduce inventories. Tools & Hardware segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, increased 3.9 points for 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in the cost of sales percentage was due to lower absorption of production costs and inefficiencies associated with adjusting manufacturing levels to achieve planned inventory reductions. Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2002 were 16.7% compared to 15.8% for 2001. Total Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses were up slightly, reflecting increased investments in strategic growth programs, while revenues declined, driving the overall percentage increase. Tools & Hardware segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2002 increased 2.5 points over 2001. The increase in selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was directly attributable to the reduction in revenues as total expenses were comparable to 2001. Cooper realizes certain costs and proceeds that are not directly attributable to the operating segments. These items are reflected as General Corporate expenses. See the "General Corporate Expense" section above. 23 EARNINGS OUTLOOK The following sets forth Coopers general business outlook for 2004 based on current expectations. Cooper expects modest growth in revenues for Electrical Products in 2004 through new product introductions and market penetration. In the Tools & Hardware segment, Cooper expects revenue growth through new product introductions and market penetration to approximately offset the anticipated decline in the high levels of assembly equipment sales experienced in 2003. Operating earnings are expected to grow more rapidly than revenues as a result of cost reduction programs and leveraging of fixed costs. Diluted continuing earnings per share is expected to range from approximately $3.15 to $3.30 for 2004. The above statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The above statements are based on a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The primary economic assumptions include, without limitation: (1) slow growth in the domestic and international economies; (2) no significant change in raw material or energy costs; (3) realization of benefits of cost reduction programs (including implementing an Enterprise Business System) with no major disruptions from those programs currently underway; and (4) no significant adverse changes in the relationship of the U.S. dollar to the currencies of countries in which Cooper does business. The estimates also assume, without limitation, no significant change in competitive conditions and such other risk factors as are discussed from time to time in Coopers periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. PRICING AND VOLUME In each of Coopers segments, the nature of many of the products sold is such that an accurate determination of the changes in unit volume of sales is neither practical nor, in some cases, meaningful. Each segment produces a family of products, within which there exist considerable variations in size, configuration and other characteristics. It is Coopers judgment that unit volume in the Electrical Products segment was relatively unchanged and increased in the Tools & Hardware segment in 2003. During the three year period ending December 31, 2003, Cooper was unable to increase prices to fully offset cost increases in selected product offerings in both segments. Cooper has been able to control costs through strategic sourcing efforts, manufacturing improvements and other actions during this period so that the inability to increase prices has not significantly affected profitability in the segments. EFFECT OF INFLATION During each year, inflation has had a relatively minor effect on Coopers results of operations. In recent years, the rate of inflation in Coopers primary markets has been low overall. Cooper actively manages material costs and has achieved cost reductions in each of the last three years, which has mitigated increases in employee compensation and benefits. Due to depressed market conditions over the past three years, inflation of sales prices has been limited to specific products with overall pricing declining in each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. 24 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL For purposes of this discussion, operating working capital is defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable. Coopers operating working capital decreased $13 million to $962 million in 2003 compared to $975 million in 2002. The decrease in operating working capital for 2003 was due to a $29 million reduction in inventories and a $17 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a $32 million increase in accounts receivable. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annual revenues divided by average operating working capital) for 2003 was 4.2 turns, increasing from 3.9 turns in 2002, due to continued focus on improving the efficient use of working capital, particularly lowering inventory levels. A portion of the reduction in inventories was due to a $7 million increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. Coopers operating working capital decreased $72 million to $975 million in 2002 from $1,047 million in 2001. This decrease was primarily related to a $90 million reduction in inventories and a $70 million reduction in accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable. Contributing to the reduction in inventories was a $6 million increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories reflecting Coopers assessment of ultimate disposition in consideration of market conditions. Operating working capital turnover decreased to 3.9 turns in 2002 from 4.0 turns in 2001. The decrease from 2001 reflects the impact of lower shipments. Coopers operating working capital decreased $19 million to $1,047 million in 2001 from $1,066 million in 2000. Operating working capital turnover declined to 4.0 turns in 2001 from 4.5 turns in 2000. The impact of recent acquisitions increased operating working capital turnover in 2001 by .2 turns. The decrease from 2000 primarily reflects the lower than expected revenues experienced in 2001. CASH FLOWS Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 totaled $445 million. These funds, along with $63 million of cash received from employee stock plan activity, were used to fund capital expenditures of $80 million, dividends of $130 million and net debt repayments of $170 million and resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $162 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 totaled $480 million. These funds, along with a net $95 million of additional debt, partially offset by capital expenditures of $74 million, dividends of $130 million and share purchases of $94 million, resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $291 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2001 totaled $422 million. These funds, along with $41 million in cash received from employee stock plan activity, were used to fund capital expenditures of $115 million, dividends of $131 million, share repurchases of $42 million, and a net reduction of debt of $206 million. In connection with accounting for acquisitions, Cooper records, to the extent appropriate, accruals for the costs of closing duplicate facilities, severing redundant personnel and integrating the acquired businesses into existing Cooper operations. At December 31, 2003, Cooper had accruals totaling $18.1 million related to these activities. Cash flows from operating activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, is reduced by the amounts expended on the various accruals established in connection with each acquisition. Cooper spent $11.0 million, $7.2 million and $11.0 million on these integration activities in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 25 Cooper currently anticipates a continuance of its long term ability to annually generate approximately $200 million in cash flow available for acquisitions, debt repayment and common stock repurchases. As discussed in Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Cooper is continuing negotiations with the representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants regarding settlement of Coopers contingent liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale to Federal Mogul. It is likely that if a settlement is reached, the settlement would involve a cash contribution. Cooper anticipates that any settlement cash contribution amounts would be funded from operating cash flows. DEBT Cooper typically relies on the commercial paper market as its principal source of short term financing. As of December 31, 2001, Coopers outstanding commercial paper balance was $342 million. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Cooper had no commercial paper outstanding and cash and cash equivalents of $463.7 million and $302.0 million, respectively. Coopers practice is to back up its outstanding commercial paper with a combination of cash and committed bank credit facilities. As of December 31, 2003, the balance of these committed bank credit facilities was $450 million, which matures on November 17, 2004. Outstanding commercial paper balances, to the extent not backed up by cash, reduce the amount of available borrowings under the committed bank credit facilities. The credit facility agreements do not contain a material adverse change clause. The principal financial covenants in the agreements limit Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio to 60% and require Cooper to maintain a minimum earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest ratio of 3 to 1. Cooper is in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit facility agreements. Coopers access to the commercial paper market could be adversely affected by a change in the credit ratings assigned to its commercial paper. Should Coopers access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in its credit ratings, Cooper would rely on a combination of available cash and its committed bank credit facilities to provide short term funding. The committed bank credit facilities do not contain any provision which makes their availability to Cooper dependent on Coopers credit ratings. During June 2002, Coopers subsidiary, Cooper Industries, Inc. ("Cooper Ohio"), issued $300 million senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2007 with a 5.25% interest rate. Proceeds from the notes were used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances. During September 2002, Cooper Ohio filed a Form S 4 Registration Statement to exchange the original notes for notes with substantially identical terms, except that the exchange notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the transfer restrictions and registration rights applicable to the original notes do not apply to the exchange notes. The original and exchange notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Cooper. The exchange offer was completed on November 4, 2002 with all holders exchanging their notes. Cooper Ohio did not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer. During August 2003, Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert $300 million of 5.25% long term fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91% (with semi annual reset). The swaps mature concurrent with the long term debt and have been designated as fair value hedges. During 1999, Cooper Ohio completed a shelf registration to issue up to $500 million of debt securities. On October 28, 2002, Cooper Ohio issued $275 million senior unsecured notes due November 1, 2009, with a 5.5% interest rate. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay short term debt and other maturing indebtedness in 2002 and current maturities of long term debt in 2003. The notes are fully and 26 unconditionally guaranteed by Cooper. After this issuance, $225 million of the shelf registration remains available. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Cooper executes stand by letters of credit, performance bonds and other guarantees in the normal course of business that ensure Coopers performance or payments to third parties. The aggregate notional value of these instruments was $99.9 million at December 31, 2003. Sixty nine percent of these instruments have an expiration date within one year. In the past, no significant claims have been made against these financial instruments. Management believes the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expects no material cash outlays to occur in connection with these instruments. The following table summarizes Coopers contractual obligations at December 31, 2003 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due Four to After Less than One to Five Five Contractual Obligations: Total One Year Three Years Years Years (in millions) Long Term Debt $ 1,337.1 $ 0.4 $ 645.8 $ 405.9 $ 285.0 Short Term Debt 6.2 6.2 Noncancellable Operating Leases 106.7 23.9 39.8 26.4 16.6 Purchase Obligations 178.4 173.6 4.8 Other Long Term Liabilities(1) 278.5 18.4 36.8 36.2 187.1 $ 1,906.9 $ 222.5 $ 727.2 $ 468.5 $ 488.7 (1) Includes unfunded other postretirement benefit obligations, unfunded foreign defined benefit pension plan liabilities, other postemployment benefit liabilities and environmental liabilities. CAPITALIZATION During the first quarter of 2000, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to five million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2003, there were approximately 2.3 million shares available for repurchase under this authorization. Cooper has targeted a 35% to 45% debt to total capitalization ratio and intends to utilize cash flows to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio within this range. Excess cash flows are utilized to purchase shares of Coopers Common stock or fund acquisitions. At December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio was 38.8%, 41.8% and 39.1%, respectively. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND COMMITMENTS Capital expenditures on projects to reduce product costs, improve product quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and operating flexibility, or expand production capacity were $80 million in 2003, $74 million in 2002 and $115 million in 2001. Capital expenditures decreased during 2002 and 2001 compared to the prior year, as Cooper completed several significant projects and focused on maximizing cash generation from its operations. Accordingly, Coopers businesses concentrated on completing open projects and investing only in operationally necessary new projects. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $100 to $110 million in 2004. Projected expenditures for 2004 will focus on development of new products, the implementation of new business systems and cost reduction programs. 27 INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates affect Coopers earnings and cash flows. As a result of having sales, purchases and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies used by Coopers businesses, Cooper is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on its cash flows and earnings. Cooper enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant foreign currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions. Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year. The table below provides information about Coopers derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments at December 31, 2003 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, information on foreign denominated debt obligations that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates is presented. For debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates. The information is presented in U.S. Dollar equivalents. The actual cash flows are denominated in U.S. Dollars, Euros and British Pound Sterling as indicated in parentheses. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract. The average pay rate on interest rate swaps is based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of December 31, 2003. 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total ($ in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate (U.S. Dollar) $ 0.4 $ 229.9 $ 11.4 $ 300.4 $ 100.3 $ 277.0 $ 919.4 Average interest rate 5.8% 5.8% 5.5% 5.6% 5.6% 5.5% 5.8% Fixed rate (Euro) $ $ 374.6 $ $ $ $ $ 374.6 Average interest rate 6.3% 6.3% 6.3% Variable rate (GBP) $ $ 29.9 $ $ $ $ $ 29.9 Average interest rate 3.6% 3.6% 3.6% Variable rate (U.S. Dollar) $ $ $ $ $ $ 8.0 $ 8.0 Average interest rate 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% 1.2% Interest rate swaps: Fixed to variable: Notional amount(1) $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ 300.0 $ $ $ 300.0 Average pay rate 3.34% 4.81% 5.95% 6.46% 4.95% Average receive rate 5.25% 5.25% 5.25% 5.25% 5.25% (1) Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert its fixed rate $300 million senior unsecured debt due in July 2007 to variable rate debt. 28 The table below provides information about Coopers foreign currency forward exchange contracts to purchase currencies in excess of $5 million at December 31, 2003.

During 2002, Cooper sold at a premium U.S. Treasury securities due August 15, 2003 with a face amount of $750 million. Cooper obtained these securities pursuant to a repurchase agreement containing provisions that limited Coopers interest rate exposure under this agreement to a maximum amount of $7.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2002, Cooper settled the interest rate exposure with a cash payment of $7.0 million which was funded with cash provided by operating activities. During 2001, Cooper sold at a premium U.S. Treasury securities due November 2002 with a face amount of $1.0 billion. Cooper obtained these securities pursuant to a repurchase agreement containing provisions that limited Coopers interest rate exposure under this agreement to a maximum amount of $7.0 million. During the second quarter of 2002, Cooper settled the interest rate exposure with a cash payment of $6.0 million, which was funded with cash provided by operating activities. The repurchase agreements were settled immediately prior to the maturity of the securities. Settlement of these transactions did not require any financing by Cooper and the transactions did not create an asset or liability, other than as described above. Also during 2001, Cooper purchased at a discount Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Notes due February 2003 and immediately transferred these notes pursuant to a securities loan agreement. Subsequently, Cooper eliminated any interest rate exposure under the securities loan agreement and received a cash payment of approximately $1.9 million upon maturity of the notes. The securities loan agreement was settled immediately prior to the maturity of the notes. Settlement of this transaction will not require any financing by Cooper and this transaction did not create a liability. The face amount of the notes was $480 million.
