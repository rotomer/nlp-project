RISK FACTORS Our financial condition and performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors described below. We may amend or supplement the risk factors from time to time by other reports that we file with the SEC in the future. Our Businesses Are Subject to Competitive Pressures. Our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and we compete on the basis of price, quality, service and or brand name across the industries and markets served. Some of our competitors for certain products have greater sales, assets and financial resources than we do. Competitive pressures could affect prices we charge our customers or demand for our products, which could adversely affect our operating results. Demand for Our Products Is Sensitive to the Economic Conditions in the Markets We Serve. Demand for electrical products follows general economic conditions and is generally sensitive to activity in the commercial and residential construction markets, industrial production levels, electronic component production and spending by utilities for replacements, expansions and efficiency improvements. Demand for non powered hand tools, assembly systems and industrial power tools is driven by employment levels, industrial activity and consumer spending. In addition, demand for industrial power tools is influenced by automotive and aerospace production. Reduced demand due to economic and market conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. Price Increases or Significant Shortages of Raw Materials and Components Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Costs and the Competitive Position of Our Products. Our major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, aluminum, electronic components and plastics and, to a lesser degree brass, tin, lead, fiberglass, wood and insulating materials including transformer oil. We have multiple sources of supply for each of our major requirements, although there are limited sources of supply for electrical core steel and transformer oil that Cooper uses in electrical power transmission and distribution products. Significant shortages could disrupt the supply of raw materials or price increases could affect prices we charge our customers, our product costs, and the competitive position of our products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Operations and Supply Sources Located Outside the United States, Particularly Emerging Markets, Are Subject to Increased Risks. Our operating activities outside the United States contribute significantly to our revenues and earnings. Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global market place requires that we place more production in countries other than the United States, including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost efficient structure. In addition, we source a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third party suppliers or joint venture operations in low cost countries. Our operations outside the United States could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns. Operations outside the United States are also subject to certain regulatory and economic uncertainties including trade barriers and restrictions on the exchange and fluctuations of currency. We believe that our operations in emerging markets such as China, India and Malaysia are subject to greater risks related to these political and economic uncertainties as compared to most countries where Cooper has operations. 7 Table of Contents Our Key Strategic Initiatives Affect Our Ability to Grow Revenues, Control Costs and Improve Productivity. Our operating model is built on a platform of key strategic initiatives that are designed to grow revenues, control costs and improve productivity. Our ability to execute and realize the expected benefits from our strategic initiatives affects our revenues and operating costs. Also, our operations could be disrupted by manufacturing rationalizations and system conversions relating to the implementation of the Enterprise Business System. We Engage in Acquisitions and May Encounter Difficulties in Integrating These Businesses. We are a company that, from time to time, seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions. The success of these transactions depends on our ability to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in these transactions. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that we anticipated from an acquisition. We Have Liability Exposure for Asbestos Related Claims. We have owned businesses that manufactured and sold products that contained asbestos. We, therefore, have potential liability arising from individuals claiming illness from exposure to asbestos in those products. Insurance policies satisfy portions of claim settlements and related legal costs. We are also negotiating to participate in resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings of a previously owned business that has significant obligations for claims related to asbestos. If we are unable to reach a settlement to participate in the resolution of the bankruptcy, we will adjust the estimates of our recorded liabilities and insurance recoveries related to the matter. Those adjustments may be significant. We Could Incur a Material Amount of Taxes if There Are Unfavorable Changes in the Tax Laws or Their Interpretation. On May 22, 2002 we reorganized Cooper and became a publicly traded Bermuda company. Among other benefits, the reorganization improved our worldwide effective tax rate and increased our cash flow. Changes in the tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations may occur, with prospective or retroactive effect, which could have material adverse tax consequences for us. Inability to Maintain Access to Capital Markets May Adversely Affect Our Business and Financial Results. Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short term borrowings. If we are unable to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse affect on our business and financial results. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS Not applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES On December 31, 2005, the plants and other facilities used by Cooper throughout the world contained an aggregate of approximately 18,044,000 square feet of space, of which approximately 80 percent was owned and 20 percent was leased. The charts on the next page show the number of employees, square footage of facilities owned and leased and location of manufacturing facilities for each industry segment.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Cooper is subject to various suits, legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate disposition should not have a future additional material adverse effect on Coopers financial statements. In October 1998, Cooper sold its Automotive Products business to Federal Mogul Corporation (Federal Mogul). These discontinued businesses (including the Abex product line obtained from Pneumo Abex Corporation (Pneumo) in 1994) were operated through subsidiary companies, and the stock of those subsidiaries was sold to Federal Mogul pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 17, 1998 (1998 Agreement). In conjunction with the sale, Federal Mogul indemnified Cooper for certain liabilities of these subsidiary companies, including liabilities related to the Abex product line and any potential liability that Cooper may have to Pneumo pursuant to a 1994 Mutual Guaranty Agreement between Cooper and Pneumo. On October 1, 2001, Federal Mogul and several of its affiliates filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and indicated that Federal Mogul may not honor the indemnification obligations to Cooper. As of the date of this filing, Federal Mogul had not rejected the 1998 Agreement, which includes the indemnification to Cooper. If Federal Mogul rejects the 1998 Agreement, Cooper will be relieved of its future obligations under the 1998 Agreement, including specific indemnities relating to payment of taxes and certain obligations regarding insurance for its former Automotive Products businesses. To the extent Cooper is obligated to Pneumo for any asbestos related claims arising from the Abex product line (Abex Claims), Cooper has rights, confirmed by Pneumo, to significant insurance for such claims. Based on information provided by representatives of Federal Mogul and recent claims experience, from August 28, 1998 through December 31, 2005, a total of 137,723 Abex Claims were filed, of which 99,288 claims have been resolved leaving 38,435 Abex Claims pending at December 31, 2005, that are the responsibility of Federal Mogul. During the year ended December 31, 2005, 4,562 claims were filed and 12,827 claims were resolved. Since August 28, 1998, the average indemnity payment for resolved Abex Claims was $2,055 before insurance. A total of $82.8 million was spent on defense costs for the period August 28, 1998 through December 31, 2005. Historically, existing insurance coverage has provided 50% to 80% of the total defense and indemnity payments for Abex Claims. With the assistance of independent advisors, Bates White, LLC, in the fourth quarter of 2001 Cooper completed a thorough analysis of its potential exposure for asbestos liabilities in the event Federal Mogul rejects the 1998 Agreement. Based on Coopers analysis of its contingent liability exposure resulting from Federal Moguls bankruptcy, Cooper concluded that an additional fourth quarter 2001 discontinued operations provision of $30 million after tax, or $.32 per share, was appropriate to reflect the potential net impact of this issue. Throughout 2003, Cooper worked towards resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. This included negotiations with the representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants (the Representatives) regarding participation in Federal Moguls proposed 524(g) asbestos trust. Based on the status of the negotiations in 2004, Cooper concluded that it was probable that Federal Mogul will reject the 1998 Agreement. Cooper also concluded that the Representatives would require any negotiated settlement through the Federal Mogul bankruptcy to be at the high end of the Bates White, LLC liability analysis and with substantially lower insurance recovery assumptions and higher administrative costs. During late February and early March 2004, Cooper reassessed the accrual required based on the then current status of the negotiations with the Representatives and the liability and insurance receivable that would be required to be recorded if this matter is not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper concluded that resolution within the Federal Mogul proposed 524(g) asbestos trust would likely be within the range of the liabilities, net of insurance recoveries, that Cooper would accrue if this matter were not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Accordingly, Cooper recorded a $126.0 million after tax discontinued operations charge, net of a $70.9 income tax benefit, in the fourth quarter of 2003. 10 Table of Contents In December 2005, Cooper announced that the Company and other parties involved in the resolution of the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceeding had reached an agreement regarding Coopers participation in Federal Moguls proposed 524 (g) asbestos trust. By participating in this trust, Cooper would resolve its liability for asbestos claims arising from Coopers former Abex Friction Products business. The proposed settlement agreement was subject to court approval, approval of 75 percent of the current Abex asbestos claimants and certain other approvals. The settlement would resolve more than 38,000 pending Abex claims. Future claims would be resolved through the bankruptcy trust, and Cooper would be protected against future claims by an injunction to be issued by the district court upon plan confirmation. Key terms and aspects of the proposed settlement agreement included Cooper agreeing to pay $130 million in cash into the trust, with $115 million payable upon Federal Moguls emergence from bankruptcy. The remainder would be due on January 15, 2007, or upon emergence from bankruptcy, if later. Cooper would receive a total of $37.5 million during the funding period from other parties associated with the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper would further provide the trust 1.4 million shares of the Companys stock upon Federal Moguls emergence from bankruptcy. The agreement provided that the trust may, during the first year after issuance, sell these shares to Cooper at market prices and, thereafter, in open market transactions. The proposed settlement agreement also provided for further payments by Cooper subject to the amount and timing of insurance proceeds. Cooper agreed to make 25 annual payments of up to $20 million each, reduced by certain insurance proceeds received by the trust. In years that the insurance proceeds exceed $17 million, Cooper would be required to contribute $3 million with the excess insurance proceeds carried over to the next year. The trust would retain 10 percent of the insurance proceeds for indemnity claims paid by the trust until Coopers obligation is satisfied and would retain 15 percent thereafter. The agreement also provided for Cooper to receive the insurance proceeds related to indemnity and defense costs paid prior to the date a stay of current claims is entered by the bankruptcy court. Cooper would also be required to forego certain claims and objections in the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, the parties involved had agreed to petition the court for a stay on all current claims outstanding. Although the payments related to the settlement could extend to 25 years and the collection of insurance proceeds could extend beyond 25 years, the liability and insurance would be undiscounted on Coopers balance sheet as the amount of the actual annual payments is not reasonably predictable. A critical term of the proposed settlement was the issuance of a preliminary injunction staying all pending Abex asbestos claims. At a hearing on January 20, 2006, other parties to the bankruptcy proceedings were unable to satisfy the courts requirements to grant the required preliminary injunction. As a result, the proposed settlement agreement will require renegotiation of certain terms. Cooper remains in active negotiations with the Representatives to resolve its liability exposure for Abex Claims within the Federal Mogul proposed 524(g) trust. The final determination of whether Cooper will participate in the Federal Mogul 524(g) trust is unknown. However, Cooper management has concluded that, at the date of the filing of its Form 10 K, the most likely outcome in the range of potential outcomes is a revised settlement approximating the December 2005 proposed settlement. Accordingly, Cooper recorded a $227.2 million after tax discontinued operations charge, net of a $127.8 million income tax benefit, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The fourth quarter 2005 charge to discontinued operations included payments to a 524(g) trust over 25 years that were undiscounted, and the insurance recoveries only included recoveries where insurance in place agreements, settlements or policy recoveries were probable. If the negotiations with the Representatives in early 2004 had resulted in an agreement, Cooper would have paid all the consideration when Federal Mogul emerged from bankruptcy and the 524(g) trust was formed and would have relinquished all rights to insurance. The lack of discounting and the limited recognition of insurance recoveries in the fourth quarter 2005 charge to discontinued operations are a significant component of the increase in the accrual for discontinued operations. While it is not possible to quantify, the accrual for 11 Table of Contents discontinued operations also includes a premium for resolving the inherent uncertainty associated with resolving Abex claims through the tort system. If Cooper is unable to reach a settlement to participate in the Federal Mogul 524(g) trust, the accrual for discontinued operations potentially may have to be reduced to the estimated liability and related insurance recoveries through the tort system. There are numerous assumptions that are required to project the liability in the tort system and Cooper has not completed the analysis and determined the liability that would be recorded under this scenario. Cooper, through Pneumo Abex LLC, has access to Abex insurance policies with remaining limits on policies with solvent insurers in excess of $800 million. Cooper has included insurance recoveries of approximately $215 million pre tax in the charge to discontinued operations discussed above. Cooper believes that it is likely that additional insurance recoveries will be recorded in the future as new insurance in place agreements are consummated and settlements with insurance carriers are completed. However, extensive litigation with the insurance carriers may be required to receive those additional recoveries. If a settlement within the 524(g) trust is in fact achieved on a basis consistent with the terms discussed above, Cooper will periodically assess the current overall adequacy of the accrual for discontinued operations, including updates to the assumptions regarding estimates of insurance recoveries, levels of defense and indemnity payments and other assumptions related to the matter. As this additional information becomes available, Cooper will record a charge or credit to the accrual for discontinued operations, which may be significant. From a cash flow perspective, Cooper management continues to believe that a settlement on terms being discussed would allow Cooper to continue to grow through acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. There is significant uncertainty as to whether any settlement agreement will be finalized. In addition, any settlement remains subject to bankruptcy court approval, approval by the current claimants and other matters. At this time, the exact manner in which this issue will be resolved is not known. The accrual for potential liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale and the Federal Mogul bankruptcy was $526.3 million at December 31, 2005 and $225.1 million at December 31, 2004. Cooper has preserved its rights as a creditor for breach of Federal Moguls indemnification to Cooper and its rights against all Federal Mogul subsidiaries. Cooper intends to take all actions to seek a resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings in the event Cooper does not participate in the 524(g) trust. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report, no matters were submitted to a vote of the shareholders. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Cooper Class A common shares (symbol CBE) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Options for Cooper Class A common shares are listed on the American Stock Exchange. Cooper Class B common shares are not publicly traded. The Class B common shares were issued to Cooper Industries, Inc. in connection with the reincorporation merger in May 2002 whereby Cooper Industries, Inc., formerly the publicly traded parent company, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Cooper Industries, Ltd. Effective January 1, 2005, the Class B common shares were transferred to Cooper US, Inc., which is a wholly owned Cooper subsidiary. Cooper US, Inc. is the only holder of Class B common shares. The holders of Class B common shares are not entitled to vote, except as to matters for which the Bermuda Companies Act specifically requires voting rights for otherwise nonvoting shares. Cooper Industries, Ltd. and Cooper subsidiaries holding Class A or Class B common shares have entered into a voting agreement whereby any Class A or Class B common shares held by such Cooper subsidiaries will be voted (or abstained from voting) 12 Table of Contents in the same proportion as the other holders of Class A common shares. Therefore, Class A and Class B common shares held by Cooper subsidiaries do not dilute the voting power of the Class A common shares held by the public. As of January 31, 2006 there were 22,942 record holders of Cooper Class A common shares and one holder of Cooper Class B common shares. The high and low quarterly sales prices for the past two years of Cooper Class A common shares as reported by Dow Jones Company, Inc., are as follows: Quarter 1 2 3 4 2005 High $ 72.65 $ 72.28 $ 69.77 $ 75.75 Low 64.12 62.10 62.08 66.05 2004 High $ 58.68 $ 59.41 $ 59.74 $ 68.44 Low 51.34 52.09 53.90 59.12 Annual cash dividends declared on Coopers Class A and Class B common shares during 2004 were $1.40 a share ($.35 a quarter). On February 9, 2005, the Board of Directors declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $.37 a share (or $1.48 on an annualized basis), beginning with the dividend paid on April 1, 2005. This represents a 5.7 percent increase over the prior dividend rate. Based on Coopers capital structure in 2005, all of the dividend distributions paid by it in 2005 are treated as a return of capital to its shareholders. For dividends payable in 2006, Cooper currently anticipates that based on its capital structure all or a substantial portion of its dividend distributions will be treated as a return of capital to its shareholders. Coopers subsidiaries waived the right to receive all dividends on Class A and Class B common shares that were payable in 2004. For the dividends payable in 2005, Coopers subsidiaries that held Class A and Class B shares received dividends on such shares. The following table reflects activity related to equity securities purchased by Coopers wholly owned subsidiaries during the three months ended December 31, 2005: Purchases of Equity Securities Total Number of Shares Maximum Number of Total Number of Purchased as Part of Shares that May Yet Be Shares Average Price Publicly Announced Plans Purchased Under the Period Purchased Paid per Share or Programs Plans or Programs (1) As of 9/30/05 4,651,650 10/01/05 10/31/05 210,000 $ 67.97 210,000 4,441,650 11/01/05 11/30/05 210,000 $ 71.96 210,000 4,231,650 12/01/05 12/31/05 210,000 $ 73.33 210,000 4,021,650 Total 630,000 $ 71.09 630,000 (1) On February 9, 2000, Cooper publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million shares of Cooper Class A common stock. On November 2, 2004, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to five million additional shares of the Coopers Class A common stock. Cooper has also announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of shares issued from time to time under its equity compensation plans, matched savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan in order to offset the dilution that results from issuing shares under these plans. Further information required by this Item is set forth under the caption Equity Compensation Plan Information in Coopers Proxy Statement to be filed pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with Coopers 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the Proxy Statement) and is incorporated herein by reference. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 6.

The forward looking statements reflect Coopers expectations, objectives and goals with respect to future events and financial performance, and are based on assumptions and estimates which Cooper believes are reasonable. Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, any statements regarding future revenues, costs and expenses, earnings, earnings per share, margins, cash flows, dividends and capital expenditures. Cooper wishes to caution readers not to put undue reliance on these statements and that actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Important factors which may affect the actual results include, but are not limited to, the resolution of Federal Moguls bankruptcy proceedings, political developments, market and economic conditions, changes in raw material, transportation and energy costs, industry competition, the ability to execute and realize the expected benefits from strategic initiatives including revenue growth plans and cost control and productivity improvement programs, the magnitude of any disruptions from manufacturing rationalizations and the implementation of the Enterprise Business System, changes in mix of products sold, mergers and acquisitions and their integration into Cooper, the timing and amount of any stock repurchases by Cooper, changes in financial markets including currency exchange rate fluctuations and changing legislation and regulations including changes in tax law, tax treaties or tax regulations. The forward looking statements contained in this report are intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Critical Accounting Policies The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Cooper believes the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts. Cooper recognizes revenues when products are shipped and accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience. If actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, additional allowances may be required. The accrual for sales returns and other allowances was $62.5 million and $45.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Allowances for excess and obsolete inventory are provided based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances may be required. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $58.7 million at December 31, 2005 and $58.9 million at December 31, 2004. Pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, discount rates and estimated future employee earnings and demographics. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Differences between actuarial assumptions and estimates and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of a calculated minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service period of active employees. The accumulated benefit obligation of certain plans exceeded the fair market value of plan assets at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. This unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, plus the existing prepaid 15 Table of Contents asset resulted in a $11.0 million, $8.0 million and $22.9 million net of tax minimum pension liability charge included in accumulated other nonowner changes in equity at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total net periodic pension benefits cost was $18.9 million in 2005, $18.9 million in 2004 and $28.7 million in 2003. The decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2004 is a result of an increase in the return on plan assets due to the recovery of the U.S. stock market. Total net periodic pension benefits cost is currently expected to approximate $28.0 million in 2006. The net periodic pension benefit cost for 2006 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 5.60% and an expected return on plan assets of 8.25%. The increase in expected net periodic pension benefits cost is primarily a result of a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure plan costs from 5.75% in 2005 to 5.60% in 2006, as well as plan asset performance. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The postretirement benefits other than pensions liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of postretirement benefits expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of a minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the participants. The decline in interest rates over the past three years resulted in a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure postretirement benefit obligations from 6.25% in 2003 to 5.60% in 2005. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost is expected to decrease to $0.8 million in 2006, primarily as a result of plan amendments related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, compared to $3.6 million in 2005, $5.5 million in 2004 and $5.8 million in 2003. See Notes 1 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites owned by Cooper and third party sites where Cooper was determined to be a potentially responsible party. Third party sites frequently involve multiple potentially responsible parties and Coopers potential liability is determined based on estimates of Coopers proportionate responsibility for the total cleanup. The amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates as well as an assessment of the financial capacity of the other potentially responsible parties. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, Coopers estimate of its environmental liabilities may change. The liability for environmental remediation was $32.7 million at December 31, 2005 and $36.5 million at December 31, 2004. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Cooper revised the accrual that represents its best estimate of liabilities related to the sale of the Automotive Products business to Federal Mogul in 1998. During the three year period ending December 31, 2005, Cooper accounted for payments made to settle asbestos related cases by reducing the accrual and insurance recoveries collected during the periods as increases to the accrual. Subsequent proceeds from insurance claims for settlements would increase the accrual. The liabilities include potential liabilities in the event Federal Mogul rejects the 1998 Purchase and Sale Agreement for the sale of the Automotive Products business and certain indemnification obligations to Cooper. The analysis of Coopers contingent liability exposure for asbestos related claims involving Abex products was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2001 with assistance from independent advisors, Bates White, LLC, and assumed future resolution of the Abex related asbestos claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, throughout 2003, Cooper worked towards resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. This included negotiations with representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants (Representatives) regarding participation in Federal Moguls proposed 524(g) asbestos trust. 16 Table of Contents Based on the status of the negotiations in 2004, Cooper concluded that it was probable that Federal Mogul will reject the 1998 Agreement. Cooper also concluded that the Representatives would require any negotiated settlement through the Federal Mogul bankruptcy to be at the high end of the Bates White, LLC liability analysis and with substantially lower insurance recovery assumptions and higher administrative costs. During late February and early March 2004, Cooper reassessed the accrual required based on the then current status of the negotiations with the Representatives and the liability and insurance receivable that would be required to be recorded if this matter is not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper concluded that resolution within the Federal Mogul proposed 524(g) asbestos trust would likely be within the range of the liabilities, net of insurance recoveries, that Cooper would accrue if this matter were not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Accordingly, Cooper recorded a $126.0 million after tax discontinued operations charge in the fourth quarter of 2003. In December 2005, Cooper announced that the Company and other parties involved in the resolution of the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceeding had reached an agreement regarding Coopers participation in Federal Moguls proposed 524 (g) asbestos trust. By participating in this trust, Cooper would resolve its liability for asbestos claims arising from Coopers former Abex Friction Products business. The proposed settlement agreement was subject to court approval, approval of 75 percent of the current Abex asbestos claimants and certain other approvals. The settlement would resolve more than 38,000 pending Abex claims. Future claims would be resolved through the bankruptcy trust, and Cooper would be protected against future claims by an injunction to be issued by the district court upon plan confirmation. Key terms and aspects of the proposed settlement agreement included Cooper agreeing to pay $130 million in cash into the trust, with $115 million payable upon Federal Moguls emergence from bankruptcy. The remainder would be due on January 15, 2007, or upon emergence from bankruptcy, if later. Cooper would receive a total of $37.5 million during the funding period from other parties associated with the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper would further provide the trust 1.4 million shares of the Companys stock upon Federal Moguls emergence from bankruptcy. The agreement provided that the trust may, during the first year after issuance, sell these shares to Cooper at market prices and, thereafter, in open market transactions. The proposed settlement agreement also provided for further payments by Cooper subject to the amount and timing of insurance proceeds. Cooper agreed to make 25 annual payments of up to $20 million each, reduced by certain insurance proceeds received by the trust. In years that the insurance proceeds exceed $17 million, Cooper would be required to contribute $3 million with the excess insurance proceeds carried over to the next year. The trust would retain 10 percent of the insurance proceeds for indemnity claims paid by the trust until Coopers obligation is satisfied and would retain 15 percent thereafter. The agreement also provided for Cooper to receive the insurance proceeds related to indemnity and defense costs paid prior to the date a stay of current claims is entered by the bankruptcy court. Cooper would also be required to forego certain claims and objections in the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, the parties involved had agreed to petition the court for a stay on all current claims outstanding. Although the payments related to the settlement could extend to 25 years and the collection of insurance proceeds could extend beyond 25 years, the liability and insurance would be undiscounted on Coopers balance sheet as the amount of the actual annual payments is not reasonably predictable. A critical term of the proposed settlement was the issuance of a preliminary injunction staying all pending Abex asbestos claims. At a hearing on January 20, 2006, other parties to the bankruptcy proceedings were unable to satisfy the courts requirements to grant the required preliminary injunction. As a result, the proposed settlement agreement will require renegotiation of certain terms. Cooper remains in active negotiations with the Representatives to resolve its liability exposure for Abex Claims within the Federal Mogul proposed 524(g) trust. The final determination of whether Cooper will participate in the Federal Mogul 524(g) trust is unknown. However, Cooper management has concluded that, at the date of the filing 17 Table of Contents of its Form 10 K, the most likely outcome in the range of potential outcomes is a revised settlement approximating the December 2005 proposed settlement. Accordingly, Cooper recorded a $227.2 million after tax discontinued operations charge, net of a $127.8 million income tax benefit, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The fourth quarter 2005 charge to discontinued operations included payments to a 524(g) trust over 25 years that were undiscounted, and the insurance recoveries only included recoveries where insurance in place agreements, settlements or policy recoveries were probable. If the negotiations with the Representatives in early 2004 had resulted in an agreement, Cooper would have paid all the consideration when Federal Mogul emerged from bankruptcy and the 524(g) trust was formed and would have relinquished all rights to insurance. The lack of discounting and the limited recognition of insurance recoveries in the fourth quarter 2005 charge to discontinued operations are a significant component of the increase in the accrual for discontinued operations. While it is not possible to quantify, the accrual for discontinued operations also includes a premium for resolving the inherent uncertainty associated with resolving Abex claims though the tort system. If Cooper is unable to reach a settlement to participate in the Federal Mogul 524(g) trust, the accrual for discontinued operations potentially may have to be reduced to the estimated liability and related insurance recoveries through the tort system. There are numerous assumptions that are required to project the liability in the tort system and Cooper has not completed the analysis and determined the liability that would be recorded under this scenario. Cooper, through Pneumo Abex LLC, has access to Abex insurance policies with remaining limits on policies with solvent insurers in excess of $800 million. Cooper has included insurance recoveries of approximately $215 million pre tax in the charge to discontinued operations discussed above. Cooper believes that it is likely that additional insurance recoveries will be recorded in the future as new insurance in place agreements are consummated and settlements with insurance carriers are completed. However, extensive litigation with the insurance carriers may be required to receive those additional recoveries. If a settlement within the 524(g) trust is in fact achieved on a basis consistent with the terms discussed above, Cooper will periodically assess the current overall adequacy of the accrual for discontinued operations, including updates to the assumptions regarding estimates of insurance recoveries, levels of defense and indemnity payments and other assumptions related to the matter. As this additional information becomes available, Cooper will record a charge or credit to the accrual for discontinued operations, which may be significant. There is significant uncertainty as to whether any settlement agreement will be finalized. In addition, any settlement remains subject to bankruptcy court approval, approval by the current claimants and other matters. At this time, the exact manner in which this issue will be resolved is not known. The accrual for potential liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale and the Federal Mogul bankruptcy was $526.3 million at December 31, 2005 and $225.1 million at December 31, 2004. Cooper has preserved its rights as a creditor for breach of Federal Moguls indemnification to Cooper and its rights against all Federal Mogul subsidiaries. Cooper intends to take all actions to seek a resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings in the event Cooper does not participate in the 524(g) trust. 18 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Electrical Products $ 3,997.5 $ 3,722.2 $ 3,358.4 Tools 732.9 740.7 703.0 Total Revenues $ 4,730.4 $ 4,462.9 $ 4,061.4 See the geographic information included in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of revenues by country. 2005 vs. 2004 Revenues Revenues for 2005 increased 6% compared to 2004. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by approximately 1%. Electrical Products segment revenues for 2005, which represented 85% of total revenues increased approximately 7% compared to 2004. Currency translation contributed approximately 1% to the revenue increase. All of Coopers Electrical Products businesses experienced revenue growth over the prior year. Favorable industrial, utility and energy markets as well as steady commercial construction drove organic sales growth. Key initiatives to expand global presence and deliver new products were successful in penetrating new markets. Price increases in response to inflationary cost pressures also supported growth across the business lines. Tools segment revenues, which represented 15% of total revenues, decreased approximately 1% compared to 2004. Currency translation increased revenues by approximately 1% in 2005. Solid industrial demand drove growth in hand tools, but continued weaknesses in the automotive markets resulted in declines in power tools and automated assembly systems revenues. Retail demand increased over the previous year for hand tools, while slowing in the fourth quarter from customer inventory realignments. 2004 vs. 2003 Revenues Revenues for 2004 increased 10% compared to 2003. The impact of currency translation increased revenues approximately 2%. Electrical Products segment revenues for 2004, which represented 83% of total revenues, increased 11% compared to the prior year. Currency translation increased Electrical Products revenue by approximately 2%. Growth resulted from strong demand from utility, industrial and commercial customers as well as new product introductions and strategic market penetration programs. Realization of price increases aimed to offset higher material costs also contributed to growth. Growth was strongest in the power transmission and distribution, lighting and circuit protection businesses, but was present in each of the business units. Tools segment revenues, which contributed 17% to total 2004 revenues, increased 5% from 2003. Currency translation increased Tools revenues by approximately 3%. Increased hand tools and power tools sales were partially offset by declines in shipments of large assembly equipment systems. Demand for hand tools and power tools was largely driven by new product demand to the retail and industrial distribution markets and strong demand from industrial and retail customers. Lower assembly equipment systems revenues resulted from decreased automotive market demand for assembly line equipment systems following a strong shipment year in 2003. 19 Table of Contents Operating Results Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions, except per share data) Electrical Products $ 585.0 $ 511.2 $ 418.7 Tools 66.7 62.7 39.4 Total Segment Operating Earnings 651.7 573.9 458.1 General Corporate Expense 91.9 77.3 66.1 Operating Earnings 559.8 496.6 392.0 Interest Expense, net 64.8 68.1 74.1 Interest Income on Tax Refund (28.6 ) Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 495.0 428.5 346.5 Income Tax Expense 103.9 88.7 72.2 Income from Continuing Operations 391.1 339.8 274.3 Charge Related to Discontinued Operations 227.2 126.0 Net Income $ 163.9 $ 339.8 $ 148.3 Diluted Earnings Per Share Income from Continuing Operations $ 4.12 $ 3.58 $ 2.92 Charge from Discontinued Operations 2.39 1.34 Net Income $ 1.73 $ 3.58 $ 1.58 Cooper measures the performance of its businesses exclusive of financing expenses. All costs directly attributable to operating businesses are included in segment operating earnings. Corporate overhead costs, including costs of traditional headquarters activities, such as treasury, are not allocated to the businesses. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2005 vs. 2004 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $651.7 million in 2005 compared to $573.9 million in 2004. Electrical Products segment 2005 operating earnings increased 14% to $585.0 million from $511.2 million for 2004. Return on revenues was 14.6% for 2005, compared to 13.7% in 2004. The increase in operating earnings was due to higher revenues in key industrial, construction and utility markets and ongoing productivity improvement initiatives. Price increases sufficient to offset commodity and energy inflation also contributed to earnings. Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher selling and administrative costs in support of global expansion. Tools segment 2005 operating earnings increased 6% to $66.7 million compared to $62.7 million in 2004. Return on revenues was 9.1% in 2005 and 8.5% in 2004. The increase in operating earnings resulted from ongoing productivity improvement initiatives and benefits from previously completed restructuring projects, which offset an overall revenue decline from broad based weakness in capital spending by global automotive companies and weaker demand for power tools. Favorable price realization, which offset inflation in material and energy costs and reduced selling and administrative costs, also contributed to earnings. 20 Table of Contents 2004 vs. 2003 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $573.9 million in 2004 compared to $458.1 million in 2003. Electrical Products segment 2004 operating earnings were $511.2 million compared to $418.7 million for 2003. Return on revenues was 13.7% in 2004, compared to 12.5% in 2003. Electrical Products segment earnings for 2003 included restructuring charges of $16.4 million. Excluding these restructuring charges in 2003, the increase in Electrical Products segment earnings was due primarily to higher revenues and a lower cost structure as a result of restructuring and productivity improvement actions. Increases were partially offset by the impact of inflation on materials, energy and components. Tools segment 2004 operating earnings were $62.7 million compared to $39.4 million for 2003. Return on revenues was 8.5% in 2004 and 5.6% in 2003. The increase primarily reflects benefits of restructuring actions, productivity improvement efforts and the impact of favorable product mix from reduced shipments of lower margin assembly equipment systems, partially offset by higher material costs. Restructuring During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper recorded net restructuring charges of $16.9 million, or $13.6 million after taxes ($.14 per diluted common share). This represented costs associated with restructuring projects undertaken in 2003 of $18.4 million, partially offset by a $1.5 million adjustment of estimates for restructuring projects initiated in 2002. The most significant action included in the charges was an announcement of the closing of Cooper Wiring Devices manufacturing operations in New York City. This action included plans for the withdrawal from a multiple employer pension plan. Cooper recorded a $12.5 million obligation as an estimate of Coopers portion of unfunded benefit obligations of the plan. In 2005, Cooper finalized activities related to withdrawal from the multi employer pension plan and recorded an additional $4.0 million pre tax charge. The remaining $5.9 million charge in 2003 primarily represents severance for announced employment reductions at several locations. The 2003 net impact of the charges was $16.4 million on the Electrical Products segment, $(0.4) million on the Tools segment and $0.9 million related to General Corporate. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, Cooper had paid $5.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively, for these actions, all of which was for severance costs. A total of 114 salaried and 150 hourly personnel were eliminated as a result of these actions. The multiple employer pension obligation is expected to be paid over 20 years, beginning in 2006. Cooper estimates the annual savings from the personnel reductions was approximately $6 million, (net of the anticipated additional employees added in lower cost regions) with most of the savings beginning in the first quarter of 2004. The majority of the eliminated costs previously were reflected as cost of sales. On August 1, 2001, Danaher Corporation (Danaher) announced it had made an unsolicited proposal to Cooper for a merger through a stock and cash transaction subject to conducting due diligence procedures. On August 8, 2001, Coopers Board of Directors unanimously rejected Danahers proposal and authorized management to explore all strategic alternatives that would maximize shareholder value including mergers, sales, strategic alliances, acquisitions or other similar strategic alternatives. During the 2001 fourth quarter, Cooper recorded a General Corporate restructuring charge of $35.0 million for the fees and expenses of financial advisors. On February 13, 2002, Cooper announced that it completed its strategic alternatives review process. Cooper paid $5.0 million to the advisors in the 2001 fourth quarter and $15.7 million during 2002, leaving a balance of $14.3 million payable upon the occurrence of certain events. During the second quarter of 2003, the terms of the agreements with the financial advisors expired with the contingent events that required payment not occurring. Accordingly, the accrual was reversed in 2003 and reflected as a $14.3 million negative restructuring charge ($8.6 million, net of taxes) on the consolidated income statement. Restructuring activity for 2003 totaled $2.6 million consisting of the fourth quarter net restructuring charge of $16.9 million, less the $14.3 million negative restructuring charge. 21 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2002, Cooper committed to (1) the closure of ten manufacturing facilities, (2) further employment reductions to appropriately size Coopers workforce to market conditions, and (3) the write off of assets related to production rationalization activities. These actions were taken as a part of Cooper managements ongoing assessment of required production capacity in consideration of the current demand levels. In connection with these commitments, certain production capacity and related assets were sold, outsourced, discontinued or moved to a lower cost environment. Cooper recorded a provision for these announced actions of $39.1 million ($15.0 million of which was non cash), or $29.8 million after taxes ($.32 per diluted common share). Of this amount, $24.0 million ($11.0 million of which was non cash) was associated with the Electrical Products segment, $12.7 million ($3.4 million of which was non cash) was associated with the Tools segment and the remainder was related to General Corporate. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper reduced estimates of the cost related to those actions by $1.5 million. The following table reflects accrual balances and activity related to the fourth quarter 2002, severance and facilities closure and rationalization accruals. Number of Accrued Facilities Closure Employees Severance and Rationalization ($ in millions) Balance at December 31, 2002 1,022 $ 16.2 $ 5.8 Employees terminated (982 ) Cash expenditures (14.9 ) (2.9 ) Reversal of excess accruals (9 ) (0.9 ) (0.6 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 31 0.4 2.3 Employees terminated (31 ) Cash expenditures (0.4 ) (1.7 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 0.6 Reversal of excess accruals (0.6 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ $ A total of 435 salaried and 771 hourly positions were eliminated as a result of the closure and rationalization actions. Of those planned position eliminations, approximately 600 positions were replaced ultimately as a result of Coopers ongoing efforts to relocate production capacity to lower cost locations. The expenditures related to the 2002 restructuring charge were funded from cash provided by operating activities. Cooper estimates that the earnings impact in 2003 from these actions was approximately $10 million in pretax savings, the majority of which benefited the second half of the year. These initial savings were realized from personnel reductions that principally impacted selling and administrative expenses and lower cost of sales. Cooper estimates that incremental savings of $25.0 to $30.0 million were realized in 2004, largely reflected as lower cost of sales. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges. General Corporate Expense General Corporate expense increased $14.6 million to $91.9 million during 2005 compared to $77.3 million during the same period of 2004. The increase was primarily associated with costs incurred to reorganize certain corporate activities, higher stock based compensation costs from 2005 grants and accelerated vesting of stock based compensation and other costs related to the retirement of a senior executive. Increased audit and Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance expenses also contributed to the increase. General Corporate expense was $77.3 million in 2004, compared to $66.1 million in 2003. Included in General Corporate expense in 2003 was a $0.9 million restructuring charge offset by a $14.3 million reversal of a previously accrued restructuring charge. Also included in 2003 General Corporate expense was a $12.0 million discretionary contribution to the Cooper Industries Foundation. Excluding the net 22 Table of Contents restructuring amount and the contribution from 2003, General Corporate expense increased $9.8 million over 2003. The increase in General Corporate expense was primarily due to higher incentive and stock based compensation expenses and the audit and other costs associated with compliance with the regulations enacted in the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net for 2005 decreased $3.3 million from 2004 primarily as a result of lower average debt balances and additional interest earned on higher average cash balances, partially offset by higher average interest rates. Average debt balances were $1.26 billion and $1.34 billion, and average interest rates were 5.87% and 5.63% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense, net decreased $6.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Slightly lower average interest rates on debt and an increase in interest income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances resulted in the decrease from prior year. Average debt balances in each year were $1.34 billion and average interest rates were 5.63% and 5.82% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in average interest rates primarily resulted from the benefit of interest rate swaps entered into during August 2003 that effectively converted $300 million of 5.25% fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91%. During August 2003, Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert $300 million of 5.25% long term fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91% (with semi annual reset). The notional principal amount and maturity dates of the interest rate swaps match the underlying long term debt. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Cooper recognized reductions of interest expense, net of $0.1 million, $5.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to the interest rate swaps. Interest Income on Tax Refund During October 2003, Cooper received a refund of $75.9 million for certain claims relating to tax years prior to 1994. The refund included interest of $28.6 million. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 21.0% for 2005 and 20.7% for 2004. The increase is primarily related to increased taxable earnings in 2005 without a corresponding increase in tax benefits. The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for 2004 was 20.7% compared to 20.8% for 2003. Charge Related to Discontinued Operations In the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2003, Cooper concluded that additional charges of $227.2 million, net of a $127.8 million income tax benefit, and $126.0 million, net of a $70.9 million income tax benefit, respectively, related to potential asbestos obligations regarding the Automotive Products segment which was sold in 1998 were required in order to adjust the existing accrual to amounts within the likely range of outcomes. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Diluted Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.12 in 2005, $3.58 in 2004, and $2.92 in 2003. 23 Table of Contents Percentage of Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Cost of Sales: Electrical Products 68.1 % 69.3 % 69.9 % Tools 70.8 % 72.6 % 74.9 % Selling and Administrative: Electrical Products 17.2 % 17.0 % 17.2 % Tools 20.1 % 18.9 % 19.5 % 2005 vs. 2004 Percentage of Revenues Electrical Products segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 68.1% for 2005 compared to 69.3% for 2004. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage was primarily a result of successful pricing actions, cost reductions through focused execution of company wide productivity initiatives and leveraging of manufacturing costs from higher production volumes. Tools segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 70.8% for 2005 compared to 72.6% for 2004. The decrease in cost of sales percentage reflects successful pricing actions, productivity improvements and decreased sales of lower margin assembly systems. Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2005 were 17.2% compared to 17.0% for 2004. The increase in selling and administrative expenses percentage is primarily due to investment in strategic growth initiatives and increased stock based compensation costs. Tools segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2005 were 20.1% compared to 18.9% for 2004. The increase in the selling and administrative expenses percentage is primarily due to increased incentive based compensation expenses and investment in globalization initiatives. 2004 vs. 2003 Percentage of Revenues Electrical Products segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 0.6 points compared to 2003. The decrease in cost of sales percentage was primarily a result of reductions in the cost structure stemming from restructuring and productivity improvement actions and increased leverage of fixed costs on higher volumes partially offset by higher material, energy and component costs not fully realized in product price increases. Tools segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 2.3 points compared to 2003. This decrease in cost of sales percentage reflects improved mix of product sales as a result of lower assembly equipment systems shipments, and cost reduction actions. Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 17.0% for 2004 compared to 17.2% for 2003. This decrease in selling and administrative expenses percentage is attributable to increased leverage from higher volumes, partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs related to improved earnings. Tools segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 18.9% in 2004 compared to 19.5% in 2003. This decrease in selling and administrative expenses percentage resulted from higher revenues, partially offset by increased incentive compensation expenses. Cooper realizes certain costs and proceeds that are not directly attributable to the operating segments. These items are reflected as General Corporate expenses. See the General Corporate Expense section above. Earnings Outlook The following sets forth Coopers general business outlook for 2006 based on current expectations. 24 Table of Contents Cooper expects mid single digit growth in revenues for Electrical Products in 2006 from continuing growth in utility and industrial market demand, successful market penetration from key growth initiatives and price increases in response to commodity and energy cost inflation partially offset by slower residential construction markets. In the Tools segment, Cooper expects low single digit revenue growth through continued expansion of industrial markets, focused market penetration initiatives and price increases as a result of raw material and energy cost increases. Operating earnings are expected to grow more rapidly than revenues as a result of benefits from previous cost reduction programs, realizing further productivity improvements and leveraging of fixed costs. Diluted continuing earnings per share is expected to increase 12% to 15% compared to 2005. The above statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The above statements are based on a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The primary economic assumptions include, without limitation: (1) continued growth in the United States and other economies; (2) no significant change in raw material or energy costs that are not realized through price increases; (3) realization of benefits of cost reduction programs (including implementing an Enterprise Business System) with no major disruptions from those programs currently underway; and (4) no significant adverse changes in the relationship of the U.S. dollar to the currencies of countries in which Cooper does business. The estimates also assume, without limitation, no significant change in competitive conditions and such other risk factors as are discussed from time to time in Coopers periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pricing and Volume In each of Coopers segments, the nature of many of the products sold is such that an accurate determination of the changes in unit volume of sales is neither practical nor, in some cases, meaningful. Each segment produces a family of products, within which there exist considerable variations in size, configuration and other characteristics. It is Coopers judgment that unit volume in the Electrical Products segment increased in 2005 and the unit volume decreased in the Tools segment in 2005. During the three year period ending December 31, 2005, Cooper has experienced an overall increase in customer pricing, primarily in response to increased material, energy and components costs. Cooper has aggressively acted to control and reduce costs during the three year period through strategic sourcing, manufacturing improvement and rationalization efforts in order to improve profitability in the segments. Effect of Inflation Over the three year period, inflation has had a relatively minor impact on Coopers results of operations. However, during 2005 and 2004, there were significant increases in certain key commodities and components, which resulted in price increases in certain businesses lagging the increased costs. Coopers on going initiatives to improve productivity and rationalize its operational base has mitigated increases in employee compensation and benefits, as well as general inflation on operating costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Working Capital For purposes of this discussion, operating working capital is defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable. Coopers operating working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable) decreased $40 million to $953 million in 2005 compared to $993 million in 2004. The decrease in operating 25 Table of Contents working capital for 2005 was due to a $77 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a $21 million increase in receivables and a $16 million increase in inventories. Receivables and inventories increased with higher sales volume and ongoing efforts to improve customer service. Payables increased on higher volumes and improved payables management through expanded leverage of enterprise business system capabilities. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annualized revenues divided by average quarterly operating working capital) for 2005 of 4.9 turns increased from 4.6 turns in 2004 and was due to revenue growth and a decline in operating working capital. Coopers operating working capital increased $31 million to $993 million in 2004 compared to $962 million in 2003. The increase in operating working capital for 2004 was due to a $82 million increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a $29 million decrease in inventories and a $22 million increase in accounts payable. Excluding acquisitions and currency translation, operating working capital was essentially flat on a 10% revenue increase. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annual revenues divided by average operating working capital) for 2004 was 4.6 turns, increasing from 4.2 turns in 2003, due to continued focus on improving the use of working capital, particularly lowering inventory levels, while increasing sales. A portion of the reduction in inventories was due to an $11 million increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. Coopers operating working capital decreased $13 million to $962 million in 2003 compared to $975 million in 2002. The decrease in operating working capital for 2003 was due to a $29 million reduction in inventories and a $17 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a $32 million increase in accounts receivable. Operating working capital turnover for 2003 was 4.2 turns, increasing from 3.9 turns in 2002, due to continued focus on improving the efficient use of working capital, particularly lowering inventory levels. A portion of the reduction in inventories was due to a $7 million increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $574 million for 2005. These funds, plus $200 million of cash and cash equivalents and $73 million of cash received from employee stock activity were primarily used to fund capital expenditures of $97 million, dividends of $138 million, net debt repayments of $384 million and share purchases of $211 million during 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 totaled $474 million. These funds, along with $78 million of cash received from employee stock plan activity and a $90 million net increase in debt, were used to fund capital expenditures of $103 million, dividends of $131 million, share repurchases of $203 million and acquisitions of $49 million, resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $189 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 totaled $445 million. These funds, along with $63 million of cash received from employee stock plan activity, were used to fund capital expenditures of $80 million, dividends of $130 million and net debt repayments of $170 million, resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $162 million. In connection with accounting for acquisitions, Cooper records, to the extent appropriate, accruals for the costs of closing duplicate facilities, severing redundant personnel and integrating the acquired businesses into existing Cooper operations. At December 31, 2005, Cooper had accruals totaling $6.3 million related to these activities. Cash flows from operating activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, is reduced by the amounts expended on the various accruals established in connection with each acquisition. Cooper spent $4.7 million, $7.1 million and $11.0 million on these integration activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Cooper currently anticipates a continuance of its long term ability to annually generate in excess of $200 million in cash flow available for acquisitions, debt repayment and common stock repurchases. 26 Table of Contents As discussed in Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Cooper is continuing discussions with the representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants regarding settlement of Coopers contingent liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale to Federal Mogul. Cooper anticipates that if settlement under the terms discussed at Note 16 are in fact consummated, that all cash payment components of the final settlement would be funded from operating cash flows. Debt At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Cooper had cash and cash equivalents of $452.8 million and $652.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Cooper had short term debt of $7.6 million and $97.6 million, respectively. None of this short term debt consisted of commercial paper. Coopers practice is to back up its short term debt with a combination of cash and committed credit facilities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Cooper had a $500 million committed credit facility which matures in November 2009. Short term debt, to the extent not backed up by cash, reduces the amount of additional liquidity provided by the committed credit facility. The credit facility agreement is not subject to termination based on a decrease in Coopers debt ratings or a material adverse change clause. The principal financial covenants in the agreement limit Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio to 60% and require Cooper to maintain a minimum earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest ratio of 3 to 1. Cooper is in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit facility agreement. Coopers access to the commercial paper market could be adversely affected by a change in the credit ratings assigned to its commercial paper. Should Coopers access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in its credit ratings, Cooper would rely on a combination of available cash and its committed credit facility to provide short term funding. The committed credit facility does not contain any provision which makes its availability to Cooper dependent on Coopers credit ratings. On November 8, 2005, Cooper US, Inc., a subsidiary of Cooper, issued $325 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes that mature on November 15, 2012. Payment of the notes are guaranteed by Cooper and certain of its subsidiaries. Proceeds of the notes were swapped with cross currency interest rate swaps to 272.6 million, effectively converting the seven year U.S. notes to seven year Euro notes with an annual interest rate of 3.55%. The proceeds of 272.6 million partially funded repayment of the 6.25% Euro bonds that matured in October 2005. During June 2002, Cooper issued $300 million senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2007 with a 5.25% interest rate. During August 2003, Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert $300 million of 5.25% long term fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91% (with semi annual reset). The swaps mature concurrent with the long term debt and have been designated as fair value hedges. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Cooper executes stand by letters of credit, performance bonds and other guarantees in the normal course of business that ensure Coopers performance or payments to third parties. The aggregate notional value of these instruments was $104.3 million and $106.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Eighty one percent of these instruments have an expiration date within one year. In the past, no significant claims have been made against these financial instruments. Management believes the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expects no material cash outlays to occur in connection with these instruments. 27 Table of Contents The following table summarizes Coopers contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due Four to After Less than One to Five Five Total One Year Three Years Years Years (in millions) Contractual Obligations: Long Term Debt $ 1,014.3 $ 11.4 $ 393.9 $ 277.3 $ 331.7 Short Term Debt 7.6 7.6 Noncancellable Operating Leases 85.0 22.0 34.3 15.0 13.7 Purchase Obligations 277.8 276.9 0.8 0.1 Other Long Term Liabilities(1) 253.7 15.8 32.1 29.0 176.8 $ 1,638.4 $ 333.7 $ 461.1 $ 321.4 $ 522.2 (1) Includes unfunded other postretirement benefit obligations, unfunded non U.S. defined benefit pension plan liabilities, other postemployment benefit liabilities and environmental liabilities. Capitalization During the first quarter of 2000, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to five million shares of common stock. On November 2, 2004, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to five million additional shares of common stock. Cooper has also announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of shares issued from time to time under its equity compensation plans, matched savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan in order to offset the dilution that results from issuing shares under these plans. Cooper targets a 35% to 45% debt to total capitalization ratio. Excess cash flows are utilized to purchase shares of Coopers Common stock or fund acquisitions. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio was 31.7%, 39.0% and 38.8%, respectively. On February 9, 2005, Coopers Board of Directors increased the annual dividend rate of Coopers common stock by eight cents per share to $1.48, or 37 cents per quarter. Capital Expenditures and Commitments Capital expenditures on projects to reduce product costs, improve product quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and operating flexibility, or expand production capacity were $97 million in 2005, $103 million in 2004 and $80 million in 2003. The 2004 increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the purchase of a previously leased manufacturing facility in Mexico, relocation of Cooper Wiring Devices operations headquarters from New York City to permanent facilities in Peachtree City, Georgia, and continued implementation of new business systems. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $90 to $110 million in 2006. Projected expenditures for 2006 will focus on development of new products, continued implementation of new business systems and cost reduction programs. Interest Rate and Currency Risk Changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect Coopers earnings and cash flows. As a result of having sales, purchases and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies used by Coopers businesses, Cooper is exposed to the effect of exchange rate changes on its cash flows and earnings. Cooper enters into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions. Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year. 28 Table of Contents The table below provides information about Coopers derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments at December 31, 2005 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract.

During 2001, Cooper purchased at a discount Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Notes due February 2003 and immediately transferred these notes pursuant to a securities loan agreement. Subsequently, Cooper eliminated any interest rate exposure under the securities loan agreement and received a cash payment of approximately $1.9 million upon maturity of the notes. The securities loan agreement was settled immediately prior to the maturity of the notes. Settlement of this transaction will not require any financing by Cooper and this transaction did not create a liability. The face amount of the notes was $480 million. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the fair value of Coopers financial instruments.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by this Item is included under Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Annual Report on Form 10 K, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, includes certain forward looking statements. The forward looking statements reflect Coopers expectations, objectives and goals with respect to future events and financial performance, and are based on assumptions and estimates which Cooper believes are reasonable. Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, any statements regarding future revenues, costs and expenses, earnings, earnings per share, margins, cash flows, dividends and capital expenditures. Cooper wishes to caution readers not to put undue reliance on these statements and that actual results could differ materially from anticipated results. Important factors which may affect the actual results include, but are not limited to, the resolution of Federal Moguls bankruptcy proceedings, political developments, market and economic conditions, changes in raw material, transportation and energy costs, industry competition, the ability to execute and realize the expected benefits from strategic initiatives including revenue growth plans and cost control and productivity improvement programs, the magnitude of any disruptions from manufacturing rationalizations and the implementation of the Enterprise Business System, changes in mix of products sold, mergers and acquisitions and their integration into Cooper, the timing and amount of any stock repurchases by Cooper, changes in financial markets including currency exchange rate fluctuations and changing legislation and regulations including changes in tax law, tax treaties or tax regulations. The forward looking statements contained in this report are intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Critical Accounting Policies The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain information that is pertinent to managements discussion and analysis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Cooper believes the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts. Cooper recognizes revenues when products are shipped and accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience. If actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, additional allowances may be required. The accrual for sales returns and other allowances was $62.5 million and $45.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Allowances for excess and obsolete inventory are provided based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances may be required. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $58.7 million at December 31, 2005 and $58.9 million at December 31, 2004. Pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, discount rates and estimated future employee earnings and demographics. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Differences between actuarial assumptions and estimates and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of a calculated minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service period of active employees. The accumulated benefit obligation of certain plans exceeded the fair market value of plan assets at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. This unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, plus the existing prepaid 15 Table of Contents asset resulted in a $11.0 million, $8.0 million and $22.9 million net of tax minimum pension liability charge included in accumulated other nonowner changes in equity at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total net periodic pension benefits cost was $18.9 million in 2005, $18.9 million in 2004 and $28.7 million in 2003. The decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2004 is a result of an increase in the return on plan assets due to the recovery of the U.S. stock market. Total net periodic pension benefits cost is currently expected to approximate $28.0 million in 2006. The net periodic pension benefit cost for 2006 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 5.60% and an expected return on plan assets of 8.25%. The increase in expected net periodic pension benefits cost is primarily a result of a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure plan costs from 5.75% in 2005 to 5.60% in 2006, as well as plan asset performance. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The postretirement benefits other than pensions liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of postretirement benefits expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of a minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the participants. The decline in interest rates over the past three years resulted in a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure postretirement benefit obligations from 6.25% in 2003 to 5.60% in 2005. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost is expected to decrease to $0.8 million in 2006, primarily as a result of plan amendments related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, compared to $3.6 million in 2005, $5.5 million in 2004 and $5.8 million in 2003. See Notes 1 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites owned by Cooper and third party sites where Cooper was determined to be a potentially responsible party. Third party sites frequently involve multiple potentially responsible parties and Coopers potential liability is determined based on estimates of Coopers proportionate responsibility for the total cleanup. The amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates as well as an assessment of the financial capacity of the other potentially responsible parties. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, Coopers estimate of its environmental liabilities may change. The liability for environmental remediation was $32.7 million at December 31, 2005 and $36.5 million at December 31, 2004. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Cooper revised the accrual that represents its best estimate of liabilities related to the sale of the Automotive Products business to Federal Mogul in 1998. During the three year period ending December 31, 2005, Cooper accounted for payments made to settle asbestos related cases by reducing the accrual and insurance recoveries collected during the periods as increases to the accrual. Subsequent proceeds from insurance claims for settlements would increase the accrual. The liabilities include potential liabilities in the event Federal Mogul rejects the 1998 Purchase and Sale Agreement for the sale of the Automotive Products business and certain indemnification obligations to Cooper. The analysis of Coopers contingent liability exposure for asbestos related claims involving Abex products was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2001 with assistance from independent advisors, Bates White, LLC, and assumed future resolution of the Abex related asbestos claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, throughout 2003, Cooper worked towards resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. This included negotiations with representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants (Representatives) regarding participation in Federal Moguls proposed 524(g) asbestos trust. 16 Table of Contents Based on the status of the negotiations in 2004, Cooper concluded that it was probable that Federal Mogul will reject the 1998 Agreement. Cooper also concluded that the Representatives would require any negotiated settlement through the Federal Mogul bankruptcy to be at the high end of the Bates White, LLC liability analysis and with substantially lower insurance recovery assumptions and higher administrative costs. During late February and early March 2004, Cooper reassessed the accrual required based on the then current status of the negotiations with the Representatives and the liability and insurance receivable that would be required to be recorded if this matter is not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper concluded that resolution within the Federal Mogul proposed 524(g) asbestos trust would likely be within the range of the liabilities, net of insurance recoveries, that Cooper would accrue if this matter were not settled within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Accordingly, Cooper recorded a $126.0 million after tax discontinued operations charge in the fourth quarter of 2003. In December 2005, Cooper announced that the Company and other parties involved in the resolution of the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceeding had reached an agreement regarding Coopers participation in Federal Moguls proposed 524 (g) asbestos trust. By participating in this trust, Cooper would resolve its liability for asbestos claims arising from Coopers former Abex Friction Products business. The proposed settlement agreement was subject to court approval, approval of 75 percent of the current Abex asbestos claimants and certain other approvals. The settlement would resolve more than 38,000 pending Abex claims. Future claims would be resolved through the bankruptcy trust, and Cooper would be protected against future claims by an injunction to be issued by the district court upon plan confirmation. Key terms and aspects of the proposed settlement agreement included Cooper agreeing to pay $130 million in cash into the trust, with $115 million payable upon Federal Moguls emergence from bankruptcy. The remainder would be due on January 15, 2007, or upon emergence from bankruptcy, if later. Cooper would receive a total of $37.5 million during the funding period from other parties associated with the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper would further provide the trust 1.4 million shares of the Companys stock upon Federal Moguls emergence from bankruptcy. The agreement provided that the trust may, during the first year after issuance, sell these shares to Cooper at market prices and, thereafter, in open market transactions. The proposed settlement agreement also provided for further payments by Cooper subject to the amount and timing of insurance proceeds. Cooper agreed to make 25 annual payments of up to $20 million each, reduced by certain insurance proceeds received by the trust. In years that the insurance proceeds exceed $17 million, Cooper would be required to contribute $3 million with the excess insurance proceeds carried over to the next year. The trust would retain 10 percent of the insurance proceeds for indemnity claims paid by the trust until Coopers obligation is satisfied and would retain 15 percent thereafter. The agreement also provided for Cooper to receive the insurance proceeds related to indemnity and defense costs paid prior to the date a stay of current claims is entered by the bankruptcy court. Cooper would also be required to forego certain claims and objections in the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, the parties involved had agreed to petition the court for a stay on all current claims outstanding. Although the payments related to the settlement could extend to 25 years and the collection of insurance proceeds could extend beyond 25 years, the liability and insurance would be undiscounted on Coopers balance sheet as the amount of the actual annual payments is not reasonably predictable. A critical term of the proposed settlement was the issuance of a preliminary injunction staying all pending Abex asbestos claims. At a hearing on January 20, 2006, other parties to the bankruptcy proceedings were unable to satisfy the courts requirements to grant the required preliminary injunction. As a result, the proposed settlement agreement will require renegotiation of certain terms. Cooper remains in active negotiations with the Representatives to resolve its liability exposure for Abex Claims within the Federal Mogul proposed 524(g) trust. The final determination of whether Cooper will participate in the Federal Mogul 524(g) trust is unknown. However, Cooper management has concluded that, at the date of the filing 17 Table of Contents of its Form 10 K, the most likely outcome in the range of potential outcomes is a revised settlement approximating the December 2005 proposed settlement. Accordingly, Cooper recorded a $227.2 million after tax discontinued operations charge, net of a $127.8 million income tax benefit, in the fourth quarter of 2005. The fourth quarter 2005 charge to discontinued operations included payments to a 524(g) trust over 25 years that were undiscounted, and the insurance recoveries only included recoveries where insurance in place agreements, settlements or policy recoveries were probable. If the negotiations with the Representatives in early 2004 had resulted in an agreement, Cooper would have paid all the consideration when Federal Mogul emerged from bankruptcy and the 524(g) trust was formed and would have relinquished all rights to insurance. The lack of discounting and the limited recognition of insurance recoveries in the fourth quarter 2005 charge to discontinued operations are a significant component of the increase in the accrual for discontinued operations. While it is not possible to quantify, the accrual for discontinued operations also includes a premium for resolving the inherent uncertainty associated with resolving Abex claims though the tort system. If Cooper is unable to reach a settlement to participate in the Federal Mogul 524(g) trust, the accrual for discontinued operations potentially may have to be reduced to the estimated liability and related insurance recoveries through the tort system. There are numerous assumptions that are required to project the liability in the tort system and Cooper has not completed the analysis and determined the liability that would be recorded under this scenario. Cooper, through Pneumo Abex LLC, has access to Abex insurance policies with remaining limits on policies with solvent insurers in excess of $800 million. Cooper has included insurance recoveries of approximately $215 million pre tax in the charge to discontinued operations discussed above. Cooper believes that it is likely that additional insurance recoveries will be recorded in the future as new insurance in place agreements are consummated and settlements with insurance carriers are completed. However, extensive litigation with the insurance carriers may be required to receive those additional recoveries. If a settlement within the 524(g) trust is in fact achieved on a basis consistent with the terms discussed above, Cooper will periodically assess the current overall adequacy of the accrual for discontinued operations, including updates to the assumptions regarding estimates of insurance recoveries, levels of defense and indemnity payments and other assumptions related to the matter. As this additional information becomes available, Cooper will record a charge or credit to the accrual for discontinued operations, which may be significant. There is significant uncertainty as to whether any settlement agreement will be finalized. In addition, any settlement remains subject to bankruptcy court approval, approval by the current claimants and other matters. At this time, the exact manner in which this issue will be resolved is not known. The accrual for potential liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale and the Federal Mogul bankruptcy was $526.3 million at December 31, 2005 and $225.1 million at December 31, 2004. Cooper has preserved its rights as a creditor for breach of Federal Moguls indemnification to Cooper and its rights against all Federal Mogul subsidiaries. Cooper intends to take all actions to seek a resolution of the indemnification issues and future handling of the Abex related claims within the Federal Mogul bankruptcy proceedings in the event Cooper does not participate in the 524(g) trust. 18 Table of Contents Results of Operations Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Electrical Products $ 3,997.5 $ 3,722.2 $ 3,358.4 Tools 732.9 740.7 703.0 Total Revenues $ 4,730.4 $ 4,462.9 $ 4,061.4 See the geographic information included in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of revenues by country. 2005 vs. 2004 Revenues Revenues for 2005 increased 6% compared to 2004. The impact of currency translation increased revenues by approximately 1%. Electrical Products segment revenues for 2005, which represented 85% of total revenues increased approximately 7% compared to 2004. Currency translation contributed approximately 1% to the revenue increase. All of Coopers Electrical Products businesses experienced revenue growth over the prior year. Favorable industrial, utility and energy markets as well as steady commercial construction drove organic sales growth. Key initiatives to expand global presence and deliver new products were successful in penetrating new markets. Price increases in response to inflationary cost pressures also supported growth across the business lines. Tools segment revenues, which represented 15% of total revenues, decreased approximately 1% compared to 2004. Currency translation increased revenues by approximately 1% in 2005. Solid industrial demand drove growth in hand tools, but continued weaknesses in the automotive markets resulted in declines in power tools and automated assembly systems revenues. Retail demand increased over the previous year for hand tools, while slowing in the fourth quarter from customer inventory realignments. 2004 vs. 2003 Revenues Revenues for 2004 increased 10% compared to 2003. The impact of currency translation increased revenues approximately 2%. Electrical Products segment revenues for 2004, which represented 83% of total revenues, increased 11% compared to the prior year. Currency translation increased Electrical Products revenue by approximately 2%. Growth resulted from strong demand from utility, industrial and commercial customers as well as new product introductions and strategic market penetration programs. Realization of price increases aimed to offset higher material costs also contributed to growth. Growth was strongest in the power transmission and distribution, lighting and circuit protection businesses, but was present in each of the business units. Tools segment revenues, which contributed 17% to total 2004 revenues, increased 5% from 2003. Currency translation increased Tools revenues by approximately 3%. Increased hand tools and power tools sales were partially offset by declines in shipments of large assembly equipment systems. Demand for hand tools and power tools was largely driven by new product demand to the retail and industrial distribution markets and strong demand from industrial and retail customers. Lower assembly equipment systems revenues resulted from decreased automotive market demand for assembly line equipment systems following a strong shipment year in 2003. 19 Table of Contents Operating Results Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions, except per share data) Electrical Products $ 585.0 $ 511.2 $ 418.7 Tools 66.7 62.7 39.4 Total Segment Operating Earnings 651.7 573.9 458.1 General Corporate Expense 91.9 77.3 66.1 Operating Earnings 559.8 496.6 392.0 Interest Expense, net 64.8 68.1 74.1 Interest Income on Tax Refund (28.6 ) Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes 495.0 428.5 346.5 Income Tax Expense 103.9 88.7 72.2 Income from Continuing Operations 391.1 339.8 274.3 Charge Related to Discontinued Operations 227.2 126.0 Net Income $ 163.9 $ 339.8 $ 148.3 Diluted Earnings Per Share Income from Continuing Operations $ 4.12 $ 3.58 $ 2.92 Charge from Discontinued Operations 2.39 1.34 Net Income $ 1.73 $ 3.58 $ 1.58 Cooper measures the performance of its businesses exclusive of financing expenses. All costs directly attributable to operating businesses are included in segment operating earnings. Corporate overhead costs, including costs of traditional headquarters activities, such as treasury, are not allocated to the businesses. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2005 vs. 2004 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $651.7 million in 2005 compared to $573.9 million in 2004. Electrical Products segment 2005 operating earnings increased 14% to $585.0 million from $511.2 million for 2004. Return on revenues was 14.6% for 2005, compared to 13.7% in 2004. The increase in operating earnings was due to higher revenues in key industrial, construction and utility markets and ongoing productivity improvement initiatives. Price increases sufficient to offset commodity and energy inflation also contributed to earnings. Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher selling and administrative costs in support of global expansion. Tools segment 2005 operating earnings increased 6% to $66.7 million compared to $62.7 million in 2004. Return on revenues was 9.1% in 2005 and 8.5% in 2004. The increase in operating earnings resulted from ongoing productivity improvement initiatives and benefits from previously completed restructuring projects, which offset an overall revenue decline from broad based weakness in capital spending by global automotive companies and weaker demand for power tools. Favorable price realization, which offset inflation in material and energy costs and reduced selling and administrative costs, also contributed to earnings. 20 Table of Contents 2004 vs. 2003 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $573.9 million in 2004 compared to $458.1 million in 2003. Electrical Products segment 2004 operating earnings were $511.2 million compared to $418.7 million for 2003. Return on revenues was 13.7% in 2004, compared to 12.5% in 2003. Electrical Products segment earnings for 2003 included restructuring charges of $16.4 million. Excluding these restructuring charges in 2003, the increase in Electrical Products segment earnings was due primarily to higher revenues and a lower cost structure as a result of restructuring and productivity improvement actions. Increases were partially offset by the impact of inflation on materials, energy and components. Tools segment 2004 operating earnings were $62.7 million compared to $39.4 million for 2003. Return on revenues was 8.5% in 2004 and 5.6% in 2003. The increase primarily reflects benefits of restructuring actions, productivity improvement efforts and the impact of favorable product mix from reduced shipments of lower margin assembly equipment systems, partially offset by higher material costs. Restructuring During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper recorded net restructuring charges of $16.9 million, or $13.6 million after taxes ($.14 per diluted common share). This represented costs associated with restructuring projects undertaken in 2003 of $18.4 million, partially offset by a $1.5 million adjustment of estimates for restructuring projects initiated in 2002. The most significant action included in the charges was an announcement of the closing of Cooper Wiring Devices manufacturing operations in New York City. This action included plans for the withdrawal from a multiple employer pension plan. Cooper recorded a $12.5 million obligation as an estimate of Coopers portion of unfunded benefit obligations of the plan. In 2005, Cooper finalized activities related to withdrawal from the multi employer pension plan and recorded an additional $4.0 million pre tax charge. The remaining $5.9 million charge in 2003 primarily represents severance for announced employment reductions at several locations. The 2003 net impact of the charges was $16.4 million on the Electrical Products segment, $(0.4) million on the Tools segment and $0.9 million related to General Corporate. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, Cooper had paid $5.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively, for these actions, all of which was for severance costs. A total of 114 salaried and 150 hourly personnel were eliminated as a result of these actions. The multiple employer pension obligation is expected to be paid over 20 years, beginning in 2006. Cooper estimates the annual savings from the personnel reductions was approximately $6 million, (net of the anticipated additional employees added in lower cost regions) with most of the savings beginning in the first quarter of 2004. The majority of the eliminated costs previously were reflected as cost of sales. On August 1, 2001, Danaher Corporation (Danaher) announced it had made an unsolicited proposal to Cooper for a merger through a stock and cash transaction subject to conducting due diligence procedures. On August 8, 2001, Coopers Board of Directors unanimously rejected Danahers proposal and authorized management to explore all strategic alternatives that would maximize shareholder value including mergers, sales, strategic alliances, acquisitions or other similar strategic alternatives. During the 2001 fourth quarter, Cooper recorded a General Corporate restructuring charge of $35.0 million for the fees and expenses of financial advisors. On February 13, 2002, Cooper announced that it completed its strategic alternatives review process. Cooper paid $5.0 million to the advisors in the 2001 fourth quarter and $15.7 million during 2002, leaving a balance of $14.3 million payable upon the occurrence of certain events. During the second quarter of 2003, the terms of the agreements with the financial advisors expired with the contingent events that required payment not occurring. Accordingly, the accrual was reversed in 2003 and reflected as a $14.3 million negative restructuring charge ($8.6 million, net of taxes) on the consolidated income statement. Restructuring activity for 2003 totaled $2.6 million consisting of the fourth quarter net restructuring charge of $16.9 million, less the $14.3 million negative restructuring charge. 21 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2002, Cooper committed to (1) the closure of ten manufacturing facilities, (2) further employment reductions to appropriately size Coopers workforce to market conditions, and (3) the write off of assets related to production rationalization activities. These actions were taken as a part of Cooper managements ongoing assessment of required production capacity in consideration of the current demand levels. In connection with these commitments, certain production capacity and related assets were sold, outsourced, discontinued or moved to a lower cost environment. Cooper recorded a provision for these announced actions of $39.1 million ($15.0 million of which was non cash), or $29.8 million after taxes ($.32 per diluted common share). Of this amount, $24.0 million ($11.0 million of which was non cash) was associated with the Electrical Products segment, $12.7 million ($3.4 million of which was non cash) was associated with the Tools segment and the remainder was related to General Corporate. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Cooper reduced estimates of the cost related to those actions by $1.5 million. The following table reflects accrual balances and activity related to the fourth quarter 2002, severance and facilities closure and rationalization accruals. Number of Accrued Facilities Closure Employees Severance and Rationalization ($ in millions) Balance at December 31, 2002 1,022 $ 16.2 $ 5.8 Employees terminated (982 ) Cash expenditures (14.9 ) (2.9 ) Reversal of excess accruals (9 ) (0.9 ) (0.6 ) Balance at December 31, 2003 31 0.4 2.3 Employees terminated (31 ) Cash expenditures (0.4 ) (1.7 ) Balance at December 31, 2004 0.6 Reversal of excess accruals (0.6 ) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ $ A total of 435 salaried and 771 hourly positions were eliminated as a result of the closure and rationalization actions. Of those planned position eliminations, approximately 600 positions were replaced ultimately as a result of Coopers ongoing efforts to relocate production capacity to lower cost locations. The expenditures related to the 2002 restructuring charge were funded from cash provided by operating activities. Cooper estimates that the earnings impact in 2003 from these actions was approximately $10 million in pretax savings, the majority of which benefited the second half of the year. These initial savings were realized from personnel reductions that principally impacted selling and administrative expenses and lower cost of sales. Cooper estimates that incremental savings of $25.0 to $30.0 million were realized in 2004, largely reflected as lower cost of sales. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges. General Corporate Expense General Corporate expense increased $14.6 million to $91.9 million during 2005 compared to $77.3 million during the same period of 2004. The increase was primarily associated with costs incurred to reorganize certain corporate activities, higher stock based compensation costs from 2005 grants and accelerated vesting of stock based compensation and other costs related to the retirement of a senior executive. Increased audit and Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance expenses also contributed to the increase. General Corporate expense was $77.3 million in 2004, compared to $66.1 million in 2003. Included in General Corporate expense in 2003 was a $0.9 million restructuring charge offset by a $14.3 million reversal of a previously accrued restructuring charge. Also included in 2003 General Corporate expense was a $12.0 million discretionary contribution to the Cooper Industries Foundation. Excluding the net 22 Table of Contents restructuring amount and the contribution from 2003, General Corporate expense increased $9.8 million over 2003. The increase in General Corporate expense was primarily due to higher incentive and stock based compensation expenses and the audit and other costs associated with compliance with the regulations enacted in the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net for 2005 decreased $3.3 million from 2004 primarily as a result of lower average debt balances and additional interest earned on higher average cash balances, partially offset by higher average interest rates. Average debt balances were $1.26 billion and $1.34 billion, and average interest rates were 5.87% and 5.63% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense, net decreased $6.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Slightly lower average interest rates on debt and an increase in interest income earned on higher cash and cash equivalent balances resulted in the decrease from prior year. Average debt balances in each year were $1.34 billion and average interest rates were 5.63% and 5.82% for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in average interest rates primarily resulted from the benefit of interest rate swaps entered into during August 2003 that effectively converted $300 million of 5.25% fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91%. During August 2003, Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert $300 million of 5.25% long term fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91% (with semi annual reset). The notional principal amount and maturity dates of the interest rate swaps match the underlying long term debt. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Cooper recognized reductions of interest expense, net of $0.1 million, $5.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to the interest rate swaps. Interest Income on Tax Refund During October 2003, Cooper received a refund of $75.9 million for certain claims relating to tax years prior to 1994. The refund included interest of $28.6 million. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 21.0% for 2005 and 20.7% for 2004. The increase is primarily related to increased taxable earnings in 2005 without a corresponding increase in tax benefits. The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for 2004 was 20.7% compared to 20.8% for 2003. Charge Related to Discontinued Operations In the fourth quarters of 2005 and 2003, Cooper concluded that additional charges of $227.2 million, net of a $127.8 million income tax benefit, and $126.0 million, net of a $70.9 million income tax benefit, respectively, related to potential asbestos obligations regarding the Automotive Products segment which was sold in 1998 were required in order to adjust the existing accrual to amounts within the likely range of outcomes. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Diluted Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.12 in 2005, $3.58 in 2004, and $2.92 in 2003. 23 Table of Contents Percentage of Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Cost of Sales: Electrical Products 68.1 % 69.3 % 69.9 % Tools 70.8 % 72.6 % 74.9 % Selling and Administrative: Electrical Products 17.2 % 17.0 % 17.2 % Tools 20.1 % 18.9 % 19.5 % 2005 vs. 2004 Percentage of Revenues Electrical Products segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 68.1% for 2005 compared to 69.3% for 2004. The decrease in the cost of sales percentage was primarily a result of successful pricing actions, cost reductions through focused execution of company wide productivity initiatives and leveraging of manufacturing costs from higher production volumes. Tools segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 70.8% for 2005 compared to 72.6% for 2004. The decrease in cost of sales percentage reflects successful pricing actions, productivity improvements and decreased sales of lower margin assembly systems. Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2005 were 17.2% compared to 17.0% for 2004. The increase in selling and administrative expenses percentage is primarily due to investment in strategic growth initiatives and increased stock based compensation costs. Tools segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2005 were 20.1% compared to 18.9% for 2004. The increase in the selling and administrative expenses percentage is primarily due to increased incentive based compensation expenses and investment in globalization initiatives. 2004 vs. 2003 Percentage of Revenues Electrical Products segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 0.6 points compared to 2003. The decrease in cost of sales percentage was primarily a result of reductions in the cost structure stemming from restructuring and productivity improvement actions and increased leverage of fixed costs on higher volumes partially offset by higher material, energy and component costs not fully realized in product price increases. Tools segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 2.3 points compared to 2003. This decrease in cost of sales percentage reflects improved mix of product sales as a result of lower assembly equipment systems shipments, and cost reduction actions. Electrical Products segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 17.0% for 2004 compared to 17.2% for 2003. This decrease in selling and administrative expenses percentage is attributable to increased leverage from higher volumes, partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs related to improved earnings. Tools segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 18.9% in 2004 compared to 19.5% in 2003. This decrease in selling and administrative expenses percentage resulted from higher revenues, partially offset by increased incentive compensation expenses. Cooper realizes certain costs and proceeds that are not directly attributable to the operating segments. These items are reflected as General Corporate expenses. See the General Corporate Expense section above. Earnings Outlook The following sets forth Coopers general business outlook for 2006 based on current expectations. 24 Table of Contents Cooper expects mid single digit growth in revenues for Electrical Products in 2006 from continuing growth in utility and industrial market demand, successful market penetration from key growth initiatives and price increases in response to commodity and energy cost inflation partially offset by slower residential construction markets. In the Tools segment, Cooper expects low single digit revenue growth through continued expansion of industrial markets, focused market penetration initiatives and price increases as a result of raw material and energy cost increases. Operating earnings are expected to grow more rapidly than revenues as a result of benefits from previous cost reduction programs, realizing further productivity improvements and leveraging of fixed costs. Diluted continuing earnings per share is expected to increase 12% to 15% compared to 2005. The above statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The above statements are based on a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. The primary economic assumptions include, without limitation: (1) continued growth in the United States and other economies; (2) no significant change in raw material or energy costs that are not realized through price increases; (3) realization of benefits of cost reduction programs (including implementing an Enterprise Business System) with no major disruptions from those programs currently underway; and (4) no significant adverse changes in the relationship of the U.S. dollar to the currencies of countries in which Cooper does business. The estimates also assume, without limitation, no significant change in competitive conditions and such other risk factors as are discussed from time to time in Coopers periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pricing and Volume In each of Coopers segments, the nature of many of the products sold is such that an accurate determination of the changes in unit volume of sales is neither practical nor, in some cases, meaningful. Each segment produces a family of products, within which there exist considerable variations in size, configuration and other characteristics. It is Coopers judgment that unit volume in the Electrical Products segment increased in 2005 and the unit volume decreased in the Tools segment in 2005. During the three year period ending December 31, 2005, Cooper has experienced an overall increase in customer pricing, primarily in response to increased material, energy and components costs. Cooper has aggressively acted to control and reduce costs during the three year period through strategic sourcing, manufacturing improvement and rationalization efforts in order to improve profitability in the segments. Effect of Inflation Over the three year period, inflation has had a relatively minor impact on Coopers results of operations. However, during 2005 and 2004, there were significant increases in certain key commodities and components, which resulted in price increases in certain businesses lagging the increased costs. Coopers on going initiatives to improve productivity and rationalize its operational base has mitigated increases in employee compensation and benefits, as well as general inflation on operating costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Working Capital For purposes of this discussion, operating working capital is defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable. Coopers operating working capital (defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable) decreased $40 million to $953 million in 2005 compared to $993 million in 2004. The decrease in operating 25 Table of Contents working capital for 2005 was due to a $77 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a $21 million increase in receivables and a $16 million increase in inventories. Receivables and inventories increased with higher sales volume and ongoing efforts to improve customer service. Payables increased on higher volumes and improved payables management through expanded leverage of enterprise business system capabilities. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annualized revenues divided by average quarterly operating working capital) for 2005 of 4.9 turns increased from 4.6 turns in 2004 and was due to revenue growth and a decline in operating working capital. Coopers operating working capital increased $31 million to $993 million in 2004 compared to $962 million in 2003. The increase in operating working capital for 2004 was due to a $82 million increase in accounts receivable partially offset by a $29 million decrease in inventories and a $22 million increase in accounts payable. Excluding acquisitions and currency translation, operating working capital was essentially flat on a 10% revenue increase. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annual revenues divided by average operating working capital) for 2004 was 4.6 turns, increasing from 4.2 turns in 2003, due to continued focus on improving the use of working capital, particularly lowering inventory levels, while increasing sales. A portion of the reduction in inventories was due to an $11 million increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. Coopers operating working capital decreased $13 million to $962 million in 2003 compared to $975 million in 2002. The decrease in operating working capital for 2003 was due to a $29 million reduction in inventories and a $17 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a $32 million increase in accounts receivable. Operating working capital turnover for 2003 was 4.2 turns, increasing from 3.9 turns in 2002, due to continued focus on improving the efficient use of working capital, particularly lowering inventory levels. A portion of the reduction in inventories was due to a $7 million increase in the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $574 million for 2005. These funds, plus $200 million of cash and cash equivalents and $73 million of cash received from employee stock activity were primarily used to fund capital expenditures of $97 million, dividends of $138 million, net debt repayments of $384 million and share purchases of $211 million during 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 totaled $474 million. These funds, along with $78 million of cash received from employee stock plan activity and a $90 million net increase in debt, were used to fund capital expenditures of $103 million, dividends of $131 million, share repurchases of $203 million and acquisitions of $49 million, resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $189 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 totaled $445 million. These funds, along with $63 million of cash received from employee stock plan activity, were used to fund capital expenditures of $80 million, dividends of $130 million and net debt repayments of $170 million, resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $162 million. In connection with accounting for acquisitions, Cooper records, to the extent appropriate, accruals for the costs of closing duplicate facilities, severing redundant personnel and integrating the acquired businesses into existing Cooper operations. At December 31, 2005, Cooper had accruals totaling $6.3 million related to these activities. Cash flows from operating activities for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, is reduced by the amounts expended on the various accruals established in connection with each acquisition. Cooper spent $4.7 million, $7.1 million and $11.0 million on these integration activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Cooper currently anticipates a continuance of its long term ability to annually generate in excess of $200 million in cash flow available for acquisitions, debt repayment and common stock repurchases. 26 Table of Contents As discussed in Note 16 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Cooper is continuing discussions with the representatives of Federal Mogul, its bankruptcy committees and the future claimants regarding settlement of Coopers contingent liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale to Federal Mogul. Cooper anticipates that if settlement under the terms discussed at Note 16 are in fact consummated, that all cash payment components of the final settlement would be funded from operating cash flows. Debt At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Cooper had cash and cash equivalents of $452.8 million and $652.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Cooper had short term debt of $7.6 million and $97.6 million, respectively. None of this short term debt consisted of commercial paper. Coopers practice is to back up its short term debt with a combination of cash and committed credit facilities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Cooper had a $500 million committed credit facility which matures in November 2009. Short term debt, to the extent not backed up by cash, reduces the amount of additional liquidity provided by the committed credit facility. The credit facility agreement is not subject to termination based on a decrease in Coopers debt ratings or a material adverse change clause. The principal financial covenants in the agreement limit Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio to 60% and require Cooper to maintain a minimum earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization to interest ratio of 3 to 1. Cooper is in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit facility agreement. Coopers access to the commercial paper market could be adversely affected by a change in the credit ratings assigned to its commercial paper. Should Coopers access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in its credit ratings, Cooper would rely on a combination of available cash and its committed credit facility to provide short term funding. The committed credit facility does not contain any provision which makes its availability to Cooper dependent on Coopers credit ratings. On November 8, 2005, Cooper US, Inc., a subsidiary of Cooper, issued $325 million of 5.25% senior unsecured notes that mature on November 15, 2012. Payment of the notes are guaranteed by Cooper and certain of its subsidiaries. Proceeds of the notes were swapped with cross currency interest rate swaps to 272.6 million, effectively converting the seven year U.S. notes to seven year Euro notes with an annual interest rate of 3.55%. The proceeds of 272.6 million partially funded repayment of the 6.25% Euro bonds that matured in October 2005. During June 2002, Cooper issued $300 million senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2007 with a 5.25% interest rate. During August 2003, Cooper entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert $300 million of 5.25% long term fixed rate debt to variable rate debt at the six month LIBOR rate plus 1.91% (with semi annual reset). The swaps mature concurrent with the long term debt and have been designated as fair value hedges. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Cooper executes stand by letters of credit, performance bonds and other guarantees in the normal course of business that ensure Coopers performance or payments to third parties. The aggregate notional value of these instruments was $104.3 million and $106.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Eighty one percent of these instruments have an expiration date within one year. In the past, no significant claims have been made against these financial instruments. Management believes the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expects no material cash outlays to occur in connection with these instruments. 27 Table of Contents The following table summarizes Coopers contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due Four to After Less than One to Five Five Total One Year Three Years Years Years (in millions) Contractual Obligations: Long Term Debt $ 1,014.3 $ 11.4 $ 393.9 $ 277.3 $ 331.7 Short Term Debt 7.6 7.6 Noncancellable Operating Leases 85.0 22.0 34.3 15.0 13.7 Purchase Obligations 277.8 276.9 0.8 0.1 Other Long Term Liabilities(1) 253.7 15.8 32.1 29.0 176.8 $ 1,638.4 $ 333.7 $ 461.1 $ 321.4 $ 522.2 (1) Includes unfunded other postretirement benefit obligations, unfunded non U.S. defined benefit pension plan liabilities, other postemployment benefit liabilities and environmental liabilities. Capitalization During the first quarter of 2000, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to five million shares of common stock. On November 2, 2004, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to five million additional shares of common stock. Cooper has also announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of shares issued from time to time under its equity compensation plans, matched savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan in order to offset the dilution that results from issuing shares under these plans. Cooper targets a 35% to 45% debt to total capitalization ratio. Excess cash flows are utilized to purchase shares of Coopers Common stock or fund acquisitions. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio was 31.7%, 39.0% and 38.8%, respectively. On February 9, 2005, Coopers Board of Directors increased the annual dividend rate of Coopers common stock by eight cents per share to $1.48, or 37 cents per quarter. Capital Expenditures and Commitments Capital expenditures on projects to reduce product costs, improve product quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and operating flexibility, or expand production capacity were $97 million in 2005, $103 million in 2004 and $80 million in 2003. The 2004 increase in capital expenditures was driven primarily by the purchase of a previously leased manufacturing facility in Mexico, relocation of Cooper Wiring Devices operations headquarters from New York City to permanent facilities in Peachtree City, Georgia, and continued implementation of new business systems. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $90 to $110 million in 2006. Projected expenditures for 2006 will focus on development of new products, continued implementation of new business systems and cost reduction programs. Interest Rate and Currency Risk Changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect Coopers earnings and cash flows. As a result of having sales, purchases and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies used by Coopers businesses, Cooper is exposed to the effect of exchange rate changes on its cash flows and earnings. Cooper enters into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions. Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year. 28 Table of Contents The table below provides information about Coopers derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments at December 31, 2005 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.

During 2001, Cooper purchased at a discount Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Notes due February 2003 and immediately transferred these notes pursuant to a securities loan agreement. Subsequently, Cooper eliminated any interest rate exposure under the securities loan agreement and received a cash payment of approximately $1.9 million upon maturity of the notes. The securities loan agreement was settled immediately prior to the maturity of the notes. Settlement of this transaction will not require any financing by Cooper and this transaction did not create a liability. The face amount of the notes was $480 million. See Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the fair value of Coopers financial instruments.
