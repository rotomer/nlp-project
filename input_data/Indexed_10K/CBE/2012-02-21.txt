with certain Tools businesses from Danahers Tools and Components Segment (the Joint Venture). On July 6, 2010, Cooper announced the completion of the Joint Venture, named Apex Tool Group, LLC. Cooper and Danaher each own a 50% interest in the Joint Venture, have equal representation on its Board of Directors and have a 50% voting interest in the Joint Venture. At completion of the transaction in July 2010 Cooper deconsolidated the Tools business assets and liabilities contributed to the Joint Venture and recognized Coopers 50% ownership interest as an equity investment. The Tools Joint Venture manufactures markets and sells hand tools for industrial, construction, electronics and consumer markets; automated assembly systems; and electric and pneumatic industrial power tools, related electronics and software control and monitoring systems for industrial markets, specialized automotive service tools, tool storage, drill chucks and precision tool and workholders for industrial and consumer markets. Cooper believes that the Tools Joint Venture is among the leading manufacturers in the world of nonpower hand tools and industrial power tools. 7 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our financial condition and performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors described below. We may amend or supplement the risk factors from time to time by other reports that we file with the SEC in the future. Our Businesses Are Subject to Competitive Pressures. Our businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive, and we compete on the basis of price, quality, service, innovation and or brand name across the industries and markets served. Some of our competitors for certain products have greater sales, assets and financial resources than we do. Competitive pressures could affect prices we charge our customers or demand for our products, which could adversely affect our operating results. Demand for Our Products Is Sensitive to the Economic Conditions in the Markets We Serve. Demand for electrical products follows general economic conditions and is generally sensitive to activity in the commercial and residential construction and renovation markets, industrial production levels, electronic component production and spending by utilities for replacements, expansions and efficiency improvements. Reduced demand due to economic and market conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. Development and Introduction of New Products and Solutions Affect our Ability to Grow Revenues and Improve Profitability. Development and introduction of new products that increase our customers productivity and efficiency, provide enhanced energy efficiency, introduce new technology solutions, enhance safety and conform to electrical standards in regions and local countries contribute significantly to our revenue growth and profitability. We continually invest in new products and solutions and are not dependent upon the success of any one product or solution. However, our overall success depends on continuous new products and solutions being introduced and accepted by our customers. Price Increases or Significant Shortages of Raw Materials and Components Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Costs and the Competitive Position of Our Products. Our major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, aluminum, electronic components and plastics and, to a lesser degree brass, tin, silver, lead, fiberglass and insulating materials including transformer oil. We have multiple sources of supply for each of our major requirements, although there are limited sources of supply for electrical core steel and transformer oil that Cooper uses in electrical power transmission and distribution products. Significant shortages could disrupt the supply of raw materials or price increases could affect prices we charge our customers, our product costs, and the competitive position of our products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Operations and Supply Sources Located Outside the United States, Particularly Emerging Markets, Are Subject to Increased Risks. Our operating activities outside the United States contribute significantly to our revenues and earnings. Serving a global customer base and remaining competitive in the global market place requires that we place more production in countries other than the United States, including emerging markets, to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain a cost efficient structure. In addition, we source a significant amount of raw materials and other components from third party suppliers or majority owned joint venture operations in low cost countries. Our operations outside the United States could be disrupted by a natural disaster, labor strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns. Operations outside the United States are also subject to certain regulatory and economic uncertainties 8 including trade barriers and restrictions on the exchange and fluctuations of currency. We believe that our operations in certain emerging markets such as China, India and in the Middle East are subject to greater risks related to these political and economic uncertainties as compared to most countries where Cooper has operations. Our Key Strategic Initiatives Affect Our Ability to Grow Revenues, Control Costs and Improve Productivity. Our operating model is built on a platform of key strategic initiatives that are designed to grow revenues, control costs and improve productivity. Our ability to execute and realize the expected benefits from our strategic initiatives affects our revenues and operating costs. Also, our operations could be disrupted by manufacturing rationalizations. We Engage in Acquisitions and May Encounter Difficulties in Integrating These Businesses. We are a company that seeks to grow through strategic acquisitions. The success of these transactions depends on our ability to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in these transactions. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations and may not realize the degree or timing of the benefits that we anticipated from an acquisition. We Have Liability Exposure for Asbestos Related Claims. We have owned businesses that previously produced and sold products that contained asbestos. We, therefore, have potential liability arising from individuals claiming illnesses from exposure to asbestos. Insurance policies satisfy portions of the claim settlements and related legal costs. Historically, by far the largest portion of our potential liability arose from a Mutual Guaranty Agreement dated as of December 30, 1994 (the Mutual Guaranty), pursuant to which a subsidiary of Cooper guaranteed certain indemnification obligations to Pneumo Abex in connection with certain asbestos related personal injury claims. Certain subsidiaries of Cooper entered into a settlement agreement on February 1, 2011 with Pneumo Abex and its affiliates resolving litigation with respect to the parties respective rights and obligations arising under the Mutual Guaranty, among other things. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, which was approved by New York State Supreme Court, Commercial Division on April 5, 2011, a subsidiary of Cooper funded in part a settlement trust and Coopers obligations under the Mutual Guaranty were terminated. Since April 5, 2011, the settlement trust has been resolving asbestos related claims which formerly were indemnified by a subsidiary of the Company pursuant to the Mutual Guaranty. Further information regarding Coopers asbestos settlement is discussed under Item 3 Legal Proceedings. The amounts recorded by Cooper for its remaining asbestos liability and related insurance receivables rely on various assumptions. The key assumptions include the number and type of new claims filed each year, the average indemnity and defense costs of resolving claims, the number of years these assumptions are projected into the future, and the resolution of ongoing negotiations of additional settlement or coverage in place agreements with insurance carriers. Other factors that may affect Coopers liability and ability to recover under its insurance policies include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms that may be made by state and federal courts, and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation. Cooper reviews these assumptions on a periodic basis to determine whether any adjustments are required to the estimates of its recorded asbestos liability and related insurance receivables. 9 We Are Subject To Litigation and Environmental Regulations That Could Adversely Impact Our Operating Results. We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving product liability, tort, employment claims, intellectual property claims, and environmental matters, several of which claim, or may in the future claim, significant damages. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that existing litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws. Our operations and facilities are subject to numerous state and federal environmental laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances and other waste materials. We employ personnel responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be required from time to time and also use consultants to advise on and assist with our environmental compliance efforts. Liabilities are recorded when the need for environmental assessments and or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Laws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent than in the past and are expected to continue to become more so. Violation of environmental laws and regulations can lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial obligations, and in some cases injunctive relief. Such violations could also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property damage, and other costs and claims. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or Superfund, and related state laws and regulations, liability can be imposed jointly on the entire group of responsible parties or separately on any one of the responsible parties, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Inability to Maintain Access to Capital Markets May Adversely Affect Our Business and Financial Results. Our ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations may require access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short term borrowings. If we are unable to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse affect on our business and financial results. Risks relating to Coopers Jurisdiction of Incorporation. Legislative and regulatory action could materially adversely affect us. Legislative and regulatory action may be taken in the U.S. which, if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties upon which we rely or broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a U.S. resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and or require us to take further action, at potentially significant expense, to seek to preserve our effective tax rate. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative or regulatory proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding the reincorporation to Ireland or limiting our ability as an Irish company to take advantage of tax treaties with the U.S., we could be subjected to increased taxation and or potentially significant expense. The U.S. Federal Government and certain states and municipalities have enacted legislation intended to deny federal funding and government contracts to U.S. companies that reincorporate outside the U.S. For instance, the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010 10 signed into law in December 2009 includes a provision that prohibits government contracts with U.S. companies that have reincorporated outside the United States and this provision has remained in subsequent appropriations legislation including the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2012. We cannot provide any assurance that the impact on us of any adopted or proposed legislation in this area will not be materially adverse to our operations. In addition, there continues to be negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, companies that conduct substantial business in the U.S. but are domiciled in countries that do not have tax treaties with the United States, like Bermuda. We cannot assure you that moving our jurisdiction of incorporation to Ireland in September 2009 will eliminate the risk that we may be subject to similar criticism. We may not be able to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate. We believe that the Irish reincorporation should improve our ability to maintain a competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate. We cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be, however, because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from this expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate. Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland. The following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in Ireland: The judgment must be for a definitive sum; The judgment must be final and conclusive; and The judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction. As an Irish company, Cooper Industries plc is governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to shareholder lawsuits. The duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Cooper Industries plc securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Cooper Industries plc, which was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on June 4, 2009, became the successor registrant to Cooper Industries, Ltd. on September 9, 2009. Cooper common shares (symbol CBE) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Options for Cooper common shares are listed on the NYSE Alternext U.S. exchange. As of January 31, 2012 there were 13,656 record holders of Cooper common shares. The high and low quarterly sales prices for the past two years of Cooper common shares as reported by Dow Jones & Company, Inc., are as follows: $0000000000 $0000000000 $0000000000 $0000000000 $0000000000 Quarter 1 2 3 4 2011 High $ 65.95 $ 70.00 $ 62.82 $ 56.85 Low 57.57 57.52 41.15 43.52 2010 High $ 48.00 $ 51.74 $ 49.28 $ 59.65 Low 41.16 43.91 41.01 47.97 Cash dividends declared on Cooper Industries, Ltds Class A and Class B common shares were $.25 a share per quarter ($1.00 on an annualized basis) during 2009 (through the dividend declared on August 3, 2009). Based on Cooper Industries, Ltds capital structure in 2009, all of the dividend distributions paid by it in 2009 were treated as a return of capital to its shareholders. For the dividends payable in 2009 (through the dividend payable October 1, 2009), Coopers subsidiaries that held Class A and Class B shares of Cooper Industries, Ltd. received dividends on such shares. Cash dividends of $.25 a share were declared on Cooper Industries plcs common shares on November 3, 2009 that were paid on January 4, 2010. Cash dividends declared on Cooper Industries plcs common shares were $.27 a share per quarter ($1.08 on an annualized basis) during 2010 and $.29 a share per quarter ($1.16 on an annualized basis) during 2011. Based on Cooper Industries plcs capital structure in 2010 and 2011, all of the dividend distributions paid by it in 2010 and 2011 were treated as dividend income to its shareholders. On February 14, 2012, Coopers Board of Directors declared a dividend of $ .31 per share increasing the annual dividend rate of Coopers common stock to $1.24 per share. For dividends payable in 2012, Cooper currently anticipates that based on its capital structure all or a substantial portion of its dividend distributions will be treated as dividend income to its shareholders. 13 Irish Taxes Applicable to Dividends In certain circumstances, Cooper will be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 20%) from dividends paid to its shareholders. In the majority of cases, however, shareholders resident in the U.S. will not be subject to Irish withholding tax. Dividends paid to U.S. residents will not be subject to dividend withholding tax provided that: In the case of a beneficial owner, the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the United States and this information is provided by the broker to the Companys qualifying intermediary; or In the case of a record owner, the record owner has provided to the Companys transfer agent a valid W 9 showing either an address or valid taxpayer identification number. Shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms. Irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on Cooper shares. A shareholder who is not a resident in Ireland who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and does not hold Cooper shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any Irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by Cooper. If a shareholder who is not a resident in Ireland is subject to the dividend withholding tax, the withholding payment discharges any Irish income tax liability, provided the shareholder furnishes to the Irish Revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed. A shareholder who is a resident of Ireland may be subject to Irish income tax and or levies on dividends received from Cooper. A Transfer of Cooper Industries plc Shares May be Subject to Irish Stamp Duty A transfer of Cooper shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. A transfer of Cooper shares by a seller who holds shares directly to any buyer, or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly, may be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired, if higher) payable by the buyer. We currently intend to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially. In other cases Cooper may, in its absolute discretion, pay any stamp duty. Coopers articles of association provide that, in the event of any such payment, Cooper may seek reimbursement from the buyer or seller, at its discretion. 14 The following table reflects activity related to equity securities purchased by Cooper during the three months ended December 31, 2011: Purchases of Equity Securities Period Total Number ofSharesPurchased Average PricePaid per Share Total Number of SharesPurchased as Part ofPublicly AnnouncedPlans or Programs (1) Maximum Number ofShares that May Yet BePurchased Under thePlans or Programs (1) As of 9/30/11 3,941,073 10/01/11 10/31/11 206,326 $ 46.14 206,326 3,734,747 11/01/11 11/30/11 55,352 $ 53.45 55,352 13,679,395 12/01/11 12/31/11 13,679,395 Total 261,678 $ 47.69 261,678 (1) On February 9, 2009, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to ten million shares of Cooper common stock and increased the share repurchase authorization by ten million shares on November 1, 2011. Coopers Board has also authorized the repurchase of shares issued from time to time under its equity compensation plans, matched savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan in order to offset the dilution that results from issuing shares under these plans. For 2012 Coopers current estimate is that 2.5 million shares would be issued under equity compensation plans, which is not reflected in the above table. Cooper may continue to repurchase shares under these authorizations from time to time during 2012. The decision whether to do so will depend on the favorability of market conditions, as well as potential cash requirements for acquisitions and debt repayments. Further information required by this Item is set forth under the caption Equity Compensation Plan Information in Coopers Proxy Statement to be filed pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with Coopers 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the Proxy Statement) and is incorporated herein by reference. 15 ITEM 6.

Years Ending December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 (in millions, except per share data) INCOME STATEMENT DATA: Revenues $ 5,409.4 $ 5,065.9 $ 5,069.6 $ 6,521.3 $ 5,903.1 Income from continuing operations $ 637.3 $ 443.8 $ 413.6 $ 615.6 $ 692.3 Income related to discontinued operations, net of income taxes 190.3 25.5 16.6 Net income $ 827.6 $ 443.8 $ 439.1 $ 632.2 $ 692.3 INCOME PER COMMON SHARE DATA: Basic Income from continuing operations $ 3.91 $ 2.67 $ 2.47 $ 3.54 $ 3.80 Income from discontinued operations 1.17 .15 .10 Net income $ 5.08 $ 2.67 $ 2.62 $ 3.64 $ 3.80 Diluted Income from continuing operations $ 3.87 $ 2.64 $ 2.46 $ 3.51 $ 3.73 Income from discontinued operations 1.15 .15 .09 Net income $ 5.02 $ 2.64 $ 2.61 $ 3.60 $ 3.73 BALANCE SHEET DATA (at December 31): Total assets $ 6,447.6 $ 6,668.6 $ 5,984.4 $ 6,164.9 $ 6,133.5 Long term debt, excluding current maturities 1,096.2 1,420.4 922.7 932.5 909.9 Shareholders equity 3,536.0 3,206.1 2,963.3 2,607.4 2,841.9 CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE $ 1.16 $ 1.08 $ 1.00 $ 1.00 $ .84 In October 1998 Cooper sold its Automotive Products segment for $1.9 billion in proceeds. Subsequent to Federal Moguls Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in October 2001, Cooper has recognized income from discontinued operations for changes in potential liabilities related to the Automotive Products segment sale and the Federal Mogul bankruptcy. Cooper recognized discontinued operations income of $16.6 million, which is net of a $9.4 million income tax expense, in 2008 and $25.5 million, which is net of a $16.2 million income tax expense, in 2009 related to the ongoing resolution. Coopers contingent liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale to Federal Mogul in 1998 were resolved on April 5, 2011 with the closing of a settlement agreement with Pneumo Abex LLC. In connection with the settlement, Cooper recognized discontinued operations income of $190.3 million, which is net of a $105.6 million income tax expense, in 2011. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2010 Cooper completed a Joint Venture, named Apex Tool Group, LLC, by combining Coopers Tools business with certain Tools businesses from Danahers Tools and Components Segment. Cooper and Danaher each own a 50% interest in the Joint Venture, have equal representation on its Board of Directors and have a 50% voting interest in the Joint Venture. At completion of the transaction in July 2010 Cooper deconsolidated the Tools business assets and liabilities contributed to the Joint Venture and recognized Coopers 50% ownership interest as an equity investment. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010 Cooper recognizes its proportionate share of the Joint Ventures operating results using the equity method. Recording the joint venture investment in 2010 at its fair value of $480 million resulted in a pretax loss of $134.5 million related to the transaction that Cooper recognized in the second quarter of 2010. See Notes 3 & 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 16 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS On March 26, 2010, Cooper announced that it entered into a Framework Agreement with Danaher Corporation to create a joint venture combining Coopers Tools business with certain Tools businesses from Danahers Tools and Components Segment (the Joint Venture). On July 6, 2010, Cooper announced the completion of the Joint Venture, named Apex Tool Group, LLC. Cooper and Danaher each own a 50% interest in the Joint Venture, have equal representation on its Board of Directors and have a 50% voting interest in the Joint Venture. At completion of the transaction in July 2010 Cooper deconsolidated the Tools business assets and liabilities contributed to the Joint Venture and recognized Coopers 50% ownership interest as an equity investment. Recording the investment at its fair value of $480 million resulted in a pretax loss of $134.5 million related to the transaction, which was recognized in the second quarter 2010. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010 Cooper recognizes its proportionate share of the Joint Ventures operating results using the equity method. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Revenues Energy and Safety Solutions $ 2,926.5 $ 2,516.7 $ 2,416.6 Electrical Products Group 2,482.9 2,238.0 2,095.3 Total Electrical Segments 5,409.4 4,754.7 4,511.9 Tools 311.2 557.7 Total Revenues $ 5,409.4 $ 5,065.9 $ 5,069.6 See the geographic information included in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of revenues by country. 2011 vs. 2010 Revenues Revenues for 2011 increased 6.8% compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of the revenues from the now deconsolidated Tools segment, comparable revenues increased 13.8% in 2011 compared to 2010. Core revenues for the combined Electrical segments in 2011 were 9.9% higher than the prior year with acquisitions increasing revenues by 2.8% and currency translation increasing reported revenues by 1.1%. Energy & Safety Solutions segment revenues for 2011, which represent approximately 54% of the total revenues generated, increased 16.3% compared to 2010. Currency translation increased reported revenues by 1.6% while the impact of acquisitions increased the segment revenues by 2.9%. All of the businesses in the Energy & Safety Solutions segment reported increased revenues for 2011 as the utility and industrial markets saw strong double digit growth coupled with international developing market revenues increasing over 20%. Electrical Products Group segment revenues for 2011, which represent approximately 46% of the total revenues generated, increased 10.9% compared to 2010. Core revenues in 2011 were 7.7% higher than 2010 with currency translation increasing reported revenues by 0.5% and acquisitions adding 2.7% to reported revenues for 2011. All businesses in the Electrical Products Group segment reported increased revenues for 2011 driven by stronger industrial and electronic markets with particular strength and new products developed for energy efficient applications adding to the growth, partially offset by continued weakness in commercial markets. 2010 vs. 2009 Revenues Revenues for 2010 were essentially flat compared to 2009. Excluding the impact of the revenues from the now deconsolidated Tools segment, comparable revenues increased 5.4% in 2010 compared to 2009. Core revenues, excluding the impact of the deconsolidated Tools segment, were 4.8% higher than the prior year with acquisitions increasing revenues by 0.6% and currency translation having a minimal impact overall. 17 Energy & Safety Solutions segment revenues for 2010, which represented approximately 50% of the total revenues generated, increased 4.1% compared to 2009. Currency translation decreased reported revenues by 0.5% while the impact of acquisitions increased the segment revenues by 1.2%. All of the businesses in the Energy & Safety Solutions segment reported increased revenues for 2010 as the end markets for the segment showed improvement in the second half of the year, with international developing markets leading the recovery. Electrical Products Group segment revenues for 2010, which represented approximately 44% of the total revenues generated, increased 6.8% compared to 2009. Core revenues in 2010 were 6.3% higher than 2009 with currency translation increasing reported revenues by 0.5%. Three of the four businesses in the Electrical Products Group segment reported increased revenues for 2010 while the other business had an overall decline of less than 2%. Despite weakness in commercial markets through most of the year, the revenue growth was driven by stronger industrial and electronic markets with particular strength through international channels. Tools segment revenues for 2010, which represented about 6% of total revenues, decreased as a result of the July 6, 2010 formation of the Apex Tool Group, LLC joint venture. Prior to the deconsolidation of the segment at the beginning of the third quarter of 2010, revenues from recovering demand in the North American and Western European industrial markets increased Tools segment revenues 17.4% in the first half of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, including a 4.3% increase from currency translation. $00000000 $00000000 $00000000 Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions, except per share data) Operating Results Energy and Safety Solutions $ 494.3 $ 424.7 $ 374.9 Electrical Products Group 353.7 330.7 263.3 Total Electrical segments 848.0 755.4 638.2 Tools 33.1 18.5 Total segment operating earnings 848.0 788.5 656.7 General corporate expense 90.4 89.3 82.7 Equity in income of Apex Tool Group, LLC 66.8 22.8 Loss related to contribution of net assets to Apex Tool Group 134.5 Restructuring and other 4.0 8.0 29.9 Operating earnings 820.4 579.5 544.1 Interest expense, net 63.2 49.4 61.4 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 757.2 530.1 482.7 Income tax expense 119.9 86.3 69.1 Income from continuing operations 637.3 443.8 413.6 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 190.3 25.5 Net income $ 827.6 $ 443.8 $ 439.1 Diluted earnings per share: Income from continuing operations $ 3.87 $ 2.64 $ 2.46 Income from discontinued operations 1.15 .15 Net income $ 5.02 $ 2.64 $ 2.61 18 Cooper measures the performance of its businesses exclusive of restructuring, asset impairment and financing expenses. All costs directly attributable to operating businesses are included in segment operating earnings. Corporate overhead costs, including costs of traditional headquarters activities, such as treasury, are not allocated to the businesses. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2011 vs. 2010 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $848.0 million in 2011, an increase of 8% compared to $788.5 million in 2010. Excluding the impact of the operating earnings from the now deconsolidated Tools segment, comparable operating earnings increased 12% in 2011 compared to 2010 on comparable revenue growth of 13.8%. Energy & Safety Solutions segment 2011 operating earnings increased 16% to $494.3 million from $424.7 million in 2010 on comparable revenue growth of 16.3%. Return on revenues was 16.9% for both 2011 and 2010. The favorable impact on margins of higher production volumes for selected products and the positive impact of Coopers activities to improve overall cost productivity was substantially offset by investments made in resources to accelerate new product development and global growth opportunities. Electrical Products Group segment 2011 operating earnings increased 7% to $353.7 million from $330.7 million for 2010 on revenue growth of 10.9%. Return on revenues was 14.2% for 2011 compared to 14.8% for 2010. The favorable leverage of fixed costs from improved demand from the recovery in selected global markets and the favorable impact of actions taken to adjust operating costs was more than offset by material price inflation not fully covered by pricing actions taken for selected product lines in 2011. In addition, investments made in resources to accelerate new product development and sales and marketing resources focused on driving improved global demand along with the acquisitions completed during the year also put downward pressure on the operating earnings as a percentage of revenues. Equity income from the Apex Tool Group joint venture is included in operating earnings commencing in the third quarter of 2010. Reported equity income from Apex Tool Group was $66.8 million for 2011 compared to the $22.8 million earned in the second half of 2010. Prior to the deconsolidation of the Tools segment at the beginning of the third quarter in 2010, the Tools segment reported $33.1 million in operating earnings for the first six months of 2010. The combined increase in earnings for the year was due to the leverage on improved global demand for industrial products in the Tools segment and the impact of restructuring actions taken since the formation of the joint venture. 2010 vs. 2009 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $788.5 million in 2010, an increase of 20% compared to $656.7 million in 2009. Excluding the impact of the operating earnings from the now deconsolidated Tools segment, comparable operating earnings increased 18% in 2010 compared to 2009. Energy & Safety Solutions segment 2010 operating earnings increased 13% to $424.7 million from $374.9 million in 2009. Return on revenues was 16.9% for 2010 compared to 15.5% for 2009. Operating earnings in 2009 were favorably impacted by net inventory valuation adjustments (including decrements in LIFO inventory) of approximately $8 million. The increase in 2010 operating earnings resulted from favorable leverage of improving global market demand and the impact of restructuring actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2008. The investment in restructuring actions during 2009 and continuing in 2010 coupled with on going productivity improvements served to reduce the segments cost structure and improve return on revenues in 2010. Electrical Products Group segment 2010 operating earnings increased 26% to $330.7 million from $263.3 million for 2009. Return on revenues was 14.8% for 2010 compared to 12.6% for 2009. Operating earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted by net inventory valuation adjustments of approximately $5 million. The increase in 2010 operating earnings resulted from the positive leverage of fixed overhead due to improving global market demand and the impact of restructuring actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2008. The Electrical Products Group segments investment in restructuring actions during 2009 and continuing in 2010 coupled with on going productivity improvements served to reduce its cost structure and improve return on revenues in 2010. 19 Equity income from the Apex Tool Group joint venture is included in operating earnings commencing in the third quarter of 2010. Reported equity income from Apex Tool Group was $22.8 million in 2010. Prior to the deconsolidation of the Tools segment at the beginning of the third quarter in 2010, the Tools segment reported $33.1 million in operating earnings for the first six months of 2010 compared to $18.5 million for the full year of 2009. Tools return on revenues was 10.6% for the first six months of 2010 compared to 3.3% for the full year of 2009. The increase in earnings as a percentage of revenue was due to the leverage on improved global demand for industrial products in the Tools segment and the related impact of increased production volumes. Restructuring and Other In the fourth quarter of 2011 Cooper recorded a non cash write down of $4.0 million related to an international product line held for sale in the Electrical Products Group segment. Cooper expects to complete the sale of the product line in 2012. In 2010 Cooper recognized a pre tax restructuring charge of $8.0 million, or $6.4 million after taxes, reducing 2010 diluted earnings by $.04 per share. In 2009 Cooper recognized a pre tax restructuring charge of $28.7 million and a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $1.2 million. The 2009 restructuring and asset impairment charges of $29.9 million, or $24.4 million after taxes, reduced 2009 diluted earnings by $.14 per share. General Corporate Expense General Corporate expense increased $1.1 million during 2011 to $90.4 million compared to $89.3 million for 2010. The increase in General Corporate expense in 2011 is primarily related to normal wage inflation, higher environmental costs related to previously divested businesses, higher legal expenses and incremental costs associated with acquisitions, partially offset by cost actions taken to reduce overall General Corporate expense. General Corporate expense increased $6.6 million during 2010 to $89.3 million compared to $82.7 million for 2009. General Corporate expense in 2010 includes approximately $4 million for legal and environmental costs related to businesses disposed of in prior years and 2009 includes approximately $4 million in costs associated with the reincorporation of the Company to Ireland. The increase in General Corporate expense in 2010 is primarily related to higher long term performance based stock and incentive compensation compared to 2009. General Corporate expense in 2010 also includes approximately $2 million related to acquisition activities. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense for 2011 was $63.2 million, an increase of $13.8 million from 2010 primarily as a result of higher average debt balances, partially offset by a lower average interest rate on debt and higher interest income for 2011. Average debt balances were $1.42 billion and $965.8 million and average interest rates were 4.81% and 5.21% for 2011 and 2010, respectively. On December 7, 2010, Cooper issued $250 million of 2.375% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2016 and $250 million of 3.875% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2020. Net interest expense for 2010 was $49.4 million, a decrease of $12.0 million from 2009 primarily as a result of lower average debt balances. Average debt balances were $965.8 million and $1.17 billion and average interest rates were 5.21% and 5.36% for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 15.8% for 2011, 16.3% for 2010 and 14.3% for 2009. Income tax expense was reduced by $17.4 million, $5.6 million and $12.7 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for discrete tax items primarily related to statute expirations, tax settlements and other discrete items. In 2011 income tax expense for continuing operations was further reduced by $9.7 million for discrete tax adjustments related to the settlement of the discontinued operations asbestos liability that was required under accounting principles to be classified in continuing operations. In 2010 income tax expense was also reduced by $40.8 million to recognize the discrete tax effects related to the contribution of 20 net assets to the Tool joint venture. Excluding the discrete tax items noted above and the loss on the net asset contribution to the Apex Tool Group joint venture in 2010 Coopers effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 19.4%, 20.0% and 17.0%, respectively. Income Related to Discontinued Operations During 2009 Cooper recognized an after tax gain from discontinued operations of $25.5 million, which is net of a $16.2 million income tax expense (or $.15 per diluted share) related to its asbestos liability regarding the Automotive Products segment, which was sold in 1998. The income resulted from negotiated insurance settlements consummated during 2009 that were not previously recognized. As discussed in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on February 1, 2011, Cooper entered into a settlement agreement that closed on April 5, 2011 related to its asbestos liability regarding the Automotive Products segment. The settlement terminates the 1994 Mutual Guaranty Agreement between Cooper and Pneumo and creates a Settlement Trust. After the closing of the settlement in April 2011 the Company and its subsidiaries have no further obligations under the Mutual Guaranty Agreement. Under the settlement agreement, a subsidiary of Cooper will make payments to the Settlement Trust totaling $307.5 million ($250 million was paid at closing and the remainder is due in installments over four years, subject to certain adjustments). Cooper made the $250 million initial payment to the Settlement Trust on April 5, 2011. Other payments due under the settlement agreement total approximately $49.6 million, after certain reductions for indemnity and defense payments made by Cooper subsequent to the February 1, 2011 settlement agreement and prior to the closing on April 5, 2011. The remaining payments are due in installments at the anniversary of the closing over the next four years. As discussed in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Cooper had previously recorded an estimated accrual on an undiscounted basis for pending and future indemnity and defense costs under the Mutual Guaranty. In addition, Cooper had recorded receivables for related insurance recoveries where insurance in place agreements, settlements or policy recoveries were considered probable. As a result of the settlement agreement, Cooper adjusted is previously recorded net liability for its obligations under the Mutual Guaranty agreement to the amounts payable under the settlement agreement and related unpaid legal expenses as of March 31, 2011 resulting in the recognition in the first quarter of 2011 of an after tax gain from discontinued operations of $190.3 million, which is net of a $105.6 million income tax expense. Diluted Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $3.87 in 2011, $2.64 in 2010 and $2.46 in 2009. Net income in 2010 was reduced by the non cash after tax charge of $93.7 million, or $.56 per share related to the formation of the Tools joint venture. The increase in earnings per share for 2011, exclusive of the loss on the formation of the Tools joint venture, primarily resulted from the increase in operating earnings driven by the growth in sales and the benefit of lower common shares outstanding partially offset by higher net interest expense. The increase in earnings per share for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily resulted from improved operating earnings driven by the favorable leverage of improving global market demand and improved cost structure reflecting the benefits from restructuring actions previously taken partially offset by the loss on the formation of the Tools joint venture in 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Percentage of Revenues Cost of Sales: Energy and Safety Solutions 66.8 % 66.8 % 67.8 % Electrical Products Group 66.7 % 66.4 % 68.5 % Tools 69.0 % 74.1 % Selling and Administrative: Energy and Safety Solutions 16.3 % 16.3 % 16.7 % Electrical Products Group 19.0 % 18.8 % 18.9 % Tools 20.4 % 22.6 % 21 2011 vs 2010 Percentage of Revenues Energy & Safety Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 66.8% for both 2011 and 2010. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was essentially unchanged as the favorable impact of the higher absorption of production costs from the improved global demand coupled with productivity improvements were substantially offset by planned investments in additional research and development for new products and incremental costs associated with the consolidation of facilities to improve the overall manufacturing cost structure. Electrical Products Group segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 66.7% for 2011 compared to 66.4% for 2010. The increase in 2011 cost of sales, as a percentage of revenue, resulted from increased investment in new product development and higher than average cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for newly acquired business coupled with the segments inability to fully offset material price inflation with pricing actions for selected product lines. These items were partially offset by on going productivity improvements targeted to reduce the segments cost structure and the higher absorption of production costs from the improved global demand. Energy & Safety Solutions segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.3% for both 2011 and 2010. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was effectively flat for the segment primarily as a result of the favorable impact by leverage from increased revenues being offset by investments made in global infrastructure to enhance future growth opportunities and the higher than average selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues for newly acquired businesses. Electrical Products Group segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 19.0% for 2011 compared to 18.8% for 2010. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was the result of investments in global infrastructure to support future global growth opportunities and the higher than average selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues for newly acquired businesses partially offset by the favorable impact by leverage from increased revenues. 2010 vs 2009 Percentage of Revenues Energy & Safety Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 66.8% for 2010 compared to 67.8% for 2009. The decrease in costs of sales as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of the higher absorption of production costs from the improved global demand coupled with productivity improvements and cost reduction actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2008. Electrical Products Group segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 66.4% for 2010 compared to 68.5% for 2009. The decrease in costs of sales as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of the higher absorption of production costs from the improved global demand and productivity improvements and cost reduction actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2008. Tools segment cost of sales reflects reported segment results for the first six months of 2010 prior to the formation of the Apex Tool Group joint venture. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales for the Tools segment was 69.0% for the first half of 2010 compared to 74.1% for the full year of 2009. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was due to the higher absorption of production costs from higher volumes and productivity improvements and cost reduction actions taken during 2008 and 2009. Energy & Safety Solutions segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.3% for 2010 compared to 16.7% for 2009. The decrease in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of favorable impact by leverage from increased revenues. Electrical Products Group segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2010 was 18.8% compared to 18.9% for 2009. The decrease in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was favorably impacted by leverage from increased revenues; partially offset by investments in global infrastructure to support future global growth opportunities. Tools segment selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2010 was 20.4% compared to 22.6% for 2009, reflecting the favorable impact from improved revenues. Cooper incurs certain costs that are not directly attributable to the operating segments that are reflected as General Corporate expenses. See the General Corporate Expense section above. 22 Earnings Outlook The following sets forth Coopers general business outlook for 2012 based on current expectations. Cooper expects revenues for the Energy and Safety Solutions segment in 2012 to be up 4 to 6% as the result of continued demand from global industrial markets and utility markets partially offset by flat demand expected for products serving the commercial construction markets. The revenues for the Electrical Products Group in 2012 are expected to be up in a range of 5 to 7% on continued global industrial and electronic component demand which is expected to be partially offset by flat demand for products serving the commercial construction markets. Operating earnings are expected to improve from continued focus on productivity improvements and the favorable leverage of fixed costs from the higher global market demands. Cooper is expecting diluted continuing earnings per share to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.35. Pricing and Volume In each of Coopers segments, the nature of many of the products sold is such that an accurate determination of the changes in unit volume of sales is neither practical nor, in some cases, meaningful. Each segment produces a family of products, within which there exist considerable variations in size, configuration and other characteristics. Unit volumes in all segments increased during 2011 with the improvement in global demand favorably impacting all of Coopers businesses. Unit volumes increased in 2010 compared to 2009 levels with the end of the global recession improving global demand favorably impacting all of Coopers businesses. During the first half of 2011 Cooper was unable to fully offset inflationary costs for commodities by available market price increases primarily in certain product lines with heavy material content. During the second half of 2011 Cooper began to recover pricing in relation to material costs for those selected product lines and ended 2011 with pricing slightly below overall material inflation. During the first half of 2010 Cooper experienced favorable customer pricing from actions taken during the period. During the second half of 2010 Cooper was unable to fully offset inflationary costs for commodities by available market price increases primarily in certain product lines with heavy material content. During the first half of 2009 Cooper recognized favorable year over year customer pricing impacts from actions taken during 2008. The second half of 2009 saw a decline in customer pricing as commodity prices weakened from their 2008 elevated levels. During 2009 Cooper was able to maintain a positive benefit from the difference between price realization and material inflation/deflation. Cooper has aggressively acted to control and reduce costs during the three year period through strategic sourcing, manufacturing improvement and rationalization efforts in order to improve profitability in the segments. Effect of Inflation With the continued improvement in global economies during 2011, the pricing of commodities used in the manufacture of certain products escalated. During the first half of 2011 Cooper was unable to fully offset the inflationary costs for commodities by available market price increases in selected product lines with heavy material content. The impact of these inflationary pressures was partially offset through productivity improvements. During the second half of 2011 Cooper overall realized price increases slightly above material purchase cost increases. During 2010 as the global economies improved, the pricing of commodities used in the manufacture of certain products escalated. Through the first half of 2010 Cooper realized price increases and productivity improvements at least equal to material purchase cost increases. During the second half of 2010 Cooper was unable to fully offset the inflationary costs for commodities by available market price increases with the impact of these inflationary pressures partially offset through productivity improvements. 23 During 2009 as the global economies showed some signs of recovery, the pricing of commodities used in the manufacture of certain products began to escalate. However, in 2009 the overall mix of inflationary and deflationary material costs was not significant and Cooper was able to maintain customer pricing sufficient to offset the changing commodity costs. Cooper endeavors to mitigate the price volatility of selected commodities such as copper and steel through the use of derivatives and supply agreements. The impact of changes to these commodity costs could impact margins for several quarters as a result of this activity. Coopers on going initiatives to improve productivity and rationalize its operational base have mitigated increases in employee compensation and benefits, as well as general inflation on operating costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cooper believes our internal cash generation together with existing cash and cash equivalent balances and availability under the committed credit facility is sufficient to fund current operations, projected capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, the current rate of cash dividends, and anticipated common stock repurchases. Cooper evaluates opportunities to expand through acquisitions as well as through the growth of our current businesses. While a significant acquisition may require additional debt and or equity financing, Cooper believes its conservative financial structure and access to capital markets provides the strength and flexibility to support the liquidity needs to achieve its strategic objectives. Operating Working Capital For purposes of this discussion, operating working capital is defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable. Coopers operating working capital increased $70.3 million during 2011 reflecting growth from acquisitions and working capital investments to support revenue growth and global growth initiatives. A $82.9 million increase in accounts receivable and a $27.4 million increase in inventories were partially offset by a $40.0 million increase in accounts payable. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annualized quarterly revenues divided by average quarterly operating working capital) in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 6.0 turns compared to 6.1 turns for the same period of 2010, reflecting efficient utilization of operating working capital. Coopers operating working capital decreased $1.9 million during 2010, exclusive of the Tools business contributed to Apex Tool Group in July 2010. A $98.2 million increase in accounts receivable and a $15.0 million increase in inventories offset by a $115.1 million increase in accounts payable were driven primarily by the 5.4% increase in total Electrical segment sales offset by aggressive actions to improve Coopers vendor terms and conditions. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annualized quarterly revenues divided by average quarterly operating working capital) for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 6.1 turns compared to 5.6 turns for the same period of 2009, reflecting efficient utilization of operating working capital. Coopers operating working capital decreased $263.5 million during 2009. A $213.7 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $157.9 million decrease in inventories partially offset by a $108.1 million decrease in accounts payable were driven primarily by a 22% decrease in sales and aggressive actions to right size Coopers businesses for current market conditions. Coopers operating working capital at December 31, 2009 was approximately 23% lower than at December 31, 2008, as operating working capital levels were adjusted to the current lower operating levels. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annualized quarterly revenues divided by average quarterly operating working capital) for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 5.4 turns compared to 4.9 turns for the same period of 2008. 24 Cash Flows As discussed above and in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Coopers contingent liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale to Federal Mogul in 1998 were resolved on April 5, 2011 with the closing of a settlement agreement with Pneumo Abex LLC. The settlement agreement terminated the 1994 Mutual Guaranty Agreement between Cooper and Pneumo and requires Cooper to make payments totaling $307.5 million, subject to certain reductions, to a settlement trust. Cooper used existing cash on hand to make the $250 million initial payment to the settlement trust at the closing of the settlement agreement in April 2011 with the remaining payments due in installments over four years. Net cash provided by operating activities was $561.3 million during 2011, inclusive of the $250 million asbestos settlement payment discussed above. This cash, plus an additional $358.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $70.7 million of cash received from stock option exercises, was primarily used to fund total share purchases of $395.5 million, acquisitions of $304.7 million, dividends of $187.7 million and capital expenditures of $125.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $700.5 million during 2010. On December 7, 2010, Cooper issued $250 million of 2.375% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2016 and $250 million of 3.875% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2020. The cash from operating activities, plus net debt proceeds of $494.0 million from the December 2010 issuance and $81.4 million of cash received from stock option exercises resulted in more than a $600 million increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2010 after funding share purchases of $276.1 million, dividends of $177.4 million, capital expenditures of $98.5 million, and acquisitions of $93.2. Net cash provided by operating activities was $751.9 million during 2009. Cash provided by operating activities in 2009 is net of a $90 million payment related to a German tax dispute (see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information) and a $25 million voluntary contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The cash from operating activities, plus $22.9 million from redemption of short term investments and $20.1 million of cash received from stock option exercises was primarily used to fund debt repayments of $299.6 million, dividends of $167.4 million, capital expenditures of $126.7 million, acquisitions of $61.4 million, and share purchases of $38.5 million. On November 2, 2009, Cooper repaid the $275 million 5.5% senior unsecured notes at maturity with existing cash. Debt At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Cooper had cash and cash equivalents of $676.6 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Cooper had short term debt of $6.4 million and $7.7 million, respectively. Cooper had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010. Coopers practice is to back up its short term debt balance with a combination of cash, cash equivalents, and committed credit facilities. On May 26, 2011, Cooper entered into a credit agreement that provides a $500 million five year committed bank credit facility that replaced Coopers previous credit facility that was to mature in August 2012. The credit facility agreement is not subject to termination based on a decrease in Coopers debt ratings or a material adverse change clause. The only financial covenant in the agreement limits Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio to 60%. Cooper is in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit facility agreement. At December 31, 2011, Cooper has $500 million available under this credit facility. Coopers access to the commercial paper market could be adversely affected by a change in the credit ratings assigned to its commercial paper. Should Coopers access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in its credit ratings, Cooper would rely on a combination of available cash and its committed credit facility to provide short term funding. The committed credit facility does not contain any provision which makes its availability to Cooper dependent on Coopers credit ratings. 25 Coopers senior unsecured notes, credit facility and any commercial paper amounts outstanding are guaranteed by Cooper and certain of its principal operating subsidiaries. On December 7, 2010, Coopers wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper US, Inc. issued $250 million of 2.375% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2016 and $250 million of 3.875% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2020. Proceeds from the financing were initially invested in highly liquid investments and available for general corporate purposes. Combined with the debt issuance discount, underwriting commissions and interest rate hedges implemented in anticipation of the offering, the 2016 notes have an effective annual cost to Cooper of 2.56% and the 2020 notes have an effective annual cost to Cooper of 4.02%. On March 27, 2008, Coopers wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper US, Inc. issued $300 million of 5.45% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2015. Proceeds from the financing were used to repay commercial paper outstanding at that time. Combined with the debt issuance discount, underwriting commissions and interest rate hedges implemented in anticipation of the offering, the notes have an effective annual cost to Cooper of 5.56%. On June 18, 2007, Coopers wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper US, Inc. issued $300 million of 6.10% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2017. Proceeds from the financing were used to repay $300 million of maturing 5.25% senior unsecured notes. Combined with interest rate hedges implemented in anticipation of the offering, the notes have an effective annual cost to Cooper of 5.75%. On November 8, 2005, Coopers wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper US, Inc., issued $325 million of 5.25% fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on November 15, 2012. Proceeds of the notes were swapped to 272.6 million with cross currency interest rate swaps, effectively converting the seven year U.S. notes to seven year Euro notes with an annual interest rate of 3.55%. The proceeds of 272.6 million partially funded repayment of the 6.25% Euro bonds that matured in October 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Cooper executes stand by letters of credit, performance bonds and other guarantees in the normal course of business that ensure Coopers performance or payments to third parties. The aggregate notional value of these instruments was $118.0 million and $108.7 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Approximately eighty percent of these instruments have an expiration date within one year. In the past, no significant claims have been made against these financial instruments. Management believes the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expects no material cash outlays to occur in connection with these instruments. The following table summarizes Coopers contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due Total Less thanOne Year One toThree Years Four toFiveYears AfterFiveYears (in millions) Contractual Obligations: Long Term Debt $ 1,426.5 $ 325.0 $ 0.6 $ 550.0 $ 550.9 Short Term Debt 6.4 6.4 Interest Payments on Long Term Debt 298.0 67.2 100.6 73.1 57.1 Noncancellable Operating Leases 102.6 24.0 36.5 21.6 20.5 Purchase Obligations 278.5 277.2 1.3 Other Long Term Liabilities (1), (2) 222.1 16.2 30.9 29.6 145.4 $ 2,334.1 $ 716.0 $ 169.9 $ 674.3 $ 773.9 26 (1) Includes unfunded other postretirement benefit obligations, unfunded defined benefit pension plan liabilities and environmental liabilities. Also includes liabilities for underfunded U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans. (2) Due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with Coopers unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, Cooper is unable to make reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $8.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Capitalization On February 9, 2009, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of ten million shares of common stock and increased the share repurchase authorization by ten million shares on November 1, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, 13,679,395 shares remain available to be repurchased under the authorizations by the Board of Directors. Coopers Board has also authorized the repurchase of shares issued from time to time under its equity compensation plans, matched savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan in order to offset the dilution that results from issuing shares under these plans. For 2012 Coopers current estimate is that 2.5 million shares would be issued under equity compensation plans. Cooper may continue to repurchase shares under these authorizations from time to time during 2012. The decision whether to do so will depend on the favorability of market conditions, as well as potential cash requirements for acquisitions and debt repayments. Cooper targets a 30% to 40% debt to total capitalization ratio. Excess cash flows are utilized to fund acquisitions or to purchase shares of Cooper common stock. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio was 28.8%, 30.8% and 24.0%, respectively. Cash dividends of $.25 a share were declared on Cooper Industries plcs common shares on November 3, 2009 that were paid on January 4, 2010. Cash dividends declared on Cooper Industries plcs common shares were $.27 a share per quarter ($1.08 on an annualized basis) during 2010 and $.29 a share per quarter ($1.16 on an annualized basis) during 2011. Coopers Board of Directors declared annual cash dividends of $1.16, $1.08 and $1.00 per share for the years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On February 14, 2012, Coopers Board of Directors increased the annual dividend rate of Coopers common stock by $.08 per share to $1.24 per share. Capital Expenditures and Commitments Capital expenditures on projects to reduce product costs, improve product quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and operating flexibility, or expand production capacity were $125 million in 2011, $99 million in 2010 and $127 million in 2009. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $130 to $150 million in 2012. Projected expenditures for 2012 will focus on capacity expansions in key markets, development of new products and cost reduction programs. Interest Rate, Currency and Commodity Price Risk Changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices affect Coopers earnings and cash flows. As a result of having sales, purchases and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies used by Coopers businesses, Cooper is exposed to the effect of exchange rate changes on its cash flows and earnings. Cooper enters into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant non functional currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions. Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year. 27 The table below provides information about Coopers derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments at December 31, 2011 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates in effect during the periods presented. $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total ($ in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate (U.S. Dollar) $ 325.4 $ 0.4 $ 0.5 $ 300.2 $ 250.0 $ 550.0 $ 1426.5 Average interest rate 4.8 % 4.7 % 4.7 % 4.7 % 4.3 % 4.8 % 4.8 % Cross currency swaps: Fixed to fixed: Notional amount (1) $ 325.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 325.0 Average pay rate 3.5 % 3.5 % Average receive rate 5.2 % 5.2 % (1) Cooper entered into cross currency swaps to effectively convert $325 million of 5.25% senior unsecured debt due in November 2012 to 272.6 million with an annual interest rate of approximately 3.5%.

Changes in availability and fluctuations in commodity prices for raw materials such as steel, copper, aluminum and zinc affect Coopers earnings and cash flows. Cooper primarily manages this exposure through price changes; however, in periods of significant increases in commodity prices, the price increases in certain businesses, on occasion, lag the increased costs. Cooper also uses commodity swaps to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations on a portion of certain forecasted material purchases for copper, aluminum and zinc for periods up to eighteen months. At December 31, 2011, Cooper has commodity swaps with a notional amount of approximately $14 million, all of which mature in 2012. At December 31, 2010, Cooper had commodity swaps with a notional amount of approximately $14 million, all of which matured in 2011. 28 The table below provides information about Coopers currency forward exchange contracts to purchase currencies in excess of $10 million at December 31, 2011.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Cooper believes the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts. Cooper recognizes revenues when products are shipped, and accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience. If actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, adjustments to our allowances may be required. The accrual for sales returns and other allowances reported net in receivables was $64.0 million and $59.1 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cooper provides certain customers incentives primarily consisting of volume discounts and other short term discount and promotion programs. Cooper recognizes these incentives as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of the qualifying sale based on our estimate of the ultimate incentive amount to be earned using historical experience and known trends. If actual customer incentives differ from our estimates, adjustments to our accruals may be required. The accrual for customer incentives reported in accrued liabilities was $92.8 million and $77.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Allowances for excess and obsolete inventory are provided based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, adjustments to our inventory allowances may be required. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $65.8 million at December 31, 2011 and $57.8 million at December 31, 2010. Pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, discount rates and estimated future employee earnings and demographics. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Differences between actuarial assumptions and estimates and actual experience are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity as actuarial net gains and losses. Actuarial net gains and losses in excess of a calculated minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service period of active employees. Total net periodic pension benefit cost was $10.2 million in 2011, $16.6 million in 2010 and $26.1 million in 2009. The decrease in the net periodic pension cost in 2011 primarily resulted from lower interest costs and the favorable impact from lower amortization of actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity as well as other actuarial changes. The decrease in the net periodic pension cost in 2010 resulted from a partial recovery in the fair value of the plan assets from the lower values related to the deterioration in the securities markets in 2008, contribution of certain pension plans to the Tools joint venture in July 2010 and other actuarial changes. The estimated net periodic pension benefit cost of $6.6 million for 2012 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 4.0% and an expected return on plan assets of 8.25%. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The postretirement benefits other than pensions liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of postretirement benefits expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity as actuarial net gains and losses. Actuarial net gains and losses in excess of a minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized 31 in net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the participants. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost was ($1.6) million in 2011, $0.7 million in 2010 and ($0.4) million in 2009. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost is expected to be approximately ($4.1) million in 2012, assuming a discount rate of 4.0%. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock based compensation expense is recorded for stock option grants, performance based and restricted stock awards based upon fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period and considering expected achievement of performance goals for performance based awards. If goal level assumptions are not met, stock based compensation expense is adjusted and previously recognized compensation expense would be reversed. The fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Cooper stock, historical volatility of Cooper stock and other factors. Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of performance based and restricted stock awards granted is measured at the market price on the grant date with performance based shares adjusted, if applicable, for the fair value of a total shareholder return modifier. Performance awards are typically arranged in levels, with increasing number of shares earned as higher levels of growth are achieved. For performance based awards granted during 2009, performance goals were tied to achieving a net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio in 2009 with vesting occurring over a three year period. For performance based awards granted during 2010 and 2011, performance goals are tied to achieving defined performance metrics over a three year performance period including cumulative compound growth in earnings per share, cumulative ratio of converting continuing income to free cash flow and a modifier to adjust the awards otherwise earned based on Coopers performance relative to its 15 company peer group as measured by total shareholder returns. The amount of the performance based award earned based on achievement of earnings per share and cash flow metrics is increased 10% if Coopers total shareholder return ranks in the top third of its peer group or decreased 10% if Coopers total shareholder return ranks in the bottom third of its peer group. Total stock based compensation expense was $37.6 million in 2011, $32.0 million in 2010 and $26.3 million in 2009. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites owned by Cooper and third party sites where Cooper was determined to be a potentially responsible party. Third party sites frequently involve multiple potentially responsible parties and Coopers potential liability is determined based on estimates of Coopers proportionate responsibility for the total cleanup. The amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates as well as an assessment of the financial capacity of the other potentially responsible parties. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, Coopers estimate of its environmental liabilities may change. The liability for environmental remediation was $28.0 million at December 31, 2011 and $21.4 million at December 31, 2010. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cooper records current tax liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities for those taxes incurred as a result of current operations but deferred until future periods. The annual provision for income taxes is the sum of both the current and deferred tax amounts. Current taxes payable represents the liability related to Coopers income tax returns for the current year, while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on Coopers consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon differences between the book basis of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as measured by the enacted tax rates that Cooper expects will be in effect when these differences reverse. In addition to estimating the future applicable tax rates, Cooper must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets. Cooper has established valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 32 Cooper is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous non U.S. jurisdictions. Cooper is regularly under examination by various tax authorities. United States federal and state tax authorities and tax authorities in other countries have challenged the amount of taxes due for certain tax periods. Cooper evaluates the potential exposure associated with various filing positions and records a liability for tax contingencies. Although Cooper believes all tax positions are reasonable and properly reported in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations in effect during the periods involved, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. The resolution of tax audits and litigation could have a material effect on Coopers consolidated cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is finalized. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, income tax expense was reduced by $17.4 million, $5.6 million and $12.7 million, respectively, as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations, tax settlements and other discrete tax items. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 1993 Cooper completed an initial public offering of the stock of Belden, formerly a division of Cooper. Under the agreement, Belden and Cooper made an election that increased the tax basis of certain Belden assets. Belden is required to pay Cooper ninety percent of the amount by which Belden has actually reduced tax payments that would otherwise have been payable if the increase in the tax basis of assets had not occurred, as realized principally over fifteen years. If Belden does not have sufficient future taxable income, it is possible that Belden will not be able to utilize the tax deductions arising from the increase in the tax basis of the assets resulting in a tax loss carryforward. Belden is not obligated to pay Cooper until a tax loss carryforward is utilized. Belden can carry any loss forward twenty years to offset future taxable income. Cooper has not recognized any income from the Belden agreement since 2007. Although Cooper believes that future payments remain under the Belden agreement, Cooper and Belden are currently in dispute over the amount and status of any remaining payments under the agreement. Although the outcome of the dispute cannot be determined with certainty, Cooper does not believe the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse effect on Coopers consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows. Cooper has goodwill of $2.51 billion and $2.36 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Cooper records goodwill related to business acquisitions when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of identified assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test and Cooper has designated January 1 as the date of this test. If an event occurs, or circumstances change, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value; an interim impairment test would be performed between annual tests. Cooper has identified seven reporting units, consisting of three units in the Energy and Safety Solutions reportable operating segment and four units in the Electrical Products Group reportable operating segment for which goodwill is tested for impairment. Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying amount of its goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (e.g., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit). The primary technique we utilize in estimating the fair value of our reporting units is discounted cash flow analysis. Discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgments, estimates and assumptions, many of which are interdependent, about future sales, operating margins, growth rates, capital expenditures, working capital and discount rates. In addition to estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units using discounted cash flow analysis, we compare the sum of the fair values of our reporting units that resulted from the discounted cash flow analysis to our market capitalization to determine that our estimates of reporting unit fair value are reasonable. 33 The starting point for the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis is the annual long range financial forecast which projects our future results for a three year period. The annual planning process that we undertake to prepare the long range financial forecast takes into consideration a multitude of factors including historical growth rates and operating performance, related industry trends, macroeconomic conditions, inflationary and deflationary forces, pricing strategies, customer analysis, operational issues, competitor analysis, customer needs and marketplace data, among others. Assumptions are also made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long range financial forecast period. Our estimates of fair value are sensitive to changes in all of these variables, certain of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside our control. The long range financial forecast is typically completed early in the fourth quarter of each year, and it serves as the primary basis for our estimate of reporting unit fair values used in our annual impairment tests, absent significant changes in our outlook on future results. To determine the outlook beyond the horizon of the long range financial forecast period, we estimated a 3% annual growth rate beyond 2014 to arrive at a normalized residual year representing the perpetual cash flows of each reporting unit. The forecasted 3% annual growth rate is less than Coopers historical compounded annual growth rate achieved through 2011 for the prior five and ten year periods. The residual year cash flow was capitalized to arrive at the terminal value for each of the reporting units. Utilizing a discount rate of 11% for each reporting unit, the present value of the cash flows during the projection period and terminal value were aggregated to estimate the fair value for each of the reporting units at January 1, 2012. We assumed a discount rate of 12% in our discounted cash flow analysis at January 1, 2011 for each of our reporting units. In determining the appropriate discount rate, we considered the weighted average cost of capital for market participants. As a result of the continued recovery in 2011 from the global economic environment seen in late 2008 and into 2010, we determined that the excess fair value for each of our reporting units over its carrying value as of January 1, 2012 has improved compared with such excess as of January 1, 2011, with the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeded carrying value improving more than 18% for each of our reporting units. Based on our fair value estimates as of January 1, 2012 for each reporting unit, the fair value estimates would have to be reduced by more than 45% to reduce such fair value to the reporting units carrying value. To evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations and to address the uncertainty inherent in estimating the fair values of our reporting units, we applied a range of discount rates and long term cash flow growth assumptions. Discount rates applied ranged from 9% to 13% with long term cash flow growth assumptions ranging from 0% to 5%. Under this range of assumptions, no scenario would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. If the global economic environment significantly worsens it is possible the estimated fair values of certain reporting units could decrease such that the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be completed. In addition to estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow analysis as described above, we compared the sum of the fair values of our reporting units that resulted from the discounted cash flow analysis to our market capitalization to determine that our estimates of reporting unit fair value were reasonable. As of December 31, 2011, our equity market capitalization was approximately $8.7 billion, compared to the $3.5 billion book value of equity. As of December 31, 2010, our equity market capitalization was approximately $9.7 billion, compared to the $3.2 billion book value of equity. There are significant inherent uncertainties and management judgment involved in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, it is possible that a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with our current estimates and assumptions, or if changes in macroeconomic conditions outside the control of management change such that it results in a significant negative impact on our estimated fair values, we may be required to perform the second step of the impairment test for one or more of our reporting units, which could result in a material impairment of our goodwill. 34 In October 1998 Cooper sold its Automotive Products business to Federal Mogul Corporation (Federal Mogul). These discontinued businesses (including the Abex Friction product line obtained from Pneumo Abex Corporation (Pneumo) in 1994) were operated through subsidiary companies, and the stock of those subsidiaries was sold to Federal Mogul pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 17, 1998 (1998 Agreement). In conjunction with the sale, Federal Mogul indemnified Cooper for certain liabilities of these subsidiary companies, including liabilities related to the Abex Friction product line and any potential liability that Cooper may have to Pneumo pursuant to a 1994 Mutual Guaranty Agreement (the Mutual Guaranty) between Cooper and Pneumo. On October 1, 2001, Federal Mogul and several of its affiliates filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. The Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed Federal Moguls plan of reorganization and Federal Mogul emerged from bankruptcy in December 2007. As part of Federal Moguls Plan of Reorganization, Cooper and Federal Mogul reached a settlement agreement that was subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court resolving Federal Moguls indemnification obligations to Cooper. On September 30, 2008, the Bankruptcy Court issued its final ruling denying Coopers participation in the proposed Federal Mogul 524(g) trust resulting in Cooper implementing the previously approved Plan B Settlement, where Cooper continued to resolve through the tort system the asbestos related claims arising from the Abex Friction product line that it had sold to Federal Mogul in 1998. As discussed further below, on February 1, 2011, Cooper entered into a settlement agreement that closed on April 5, 2011 resolving Coopers liability under the Mutual Guaranty with Pneumo. The amounts recognized by Cooper for its asbestos liability and related insurance receivables under the Plan B settlement were not discounted and relied on assumptions that were based on currently known facts and strategy. The value of the liability on a discounted basis net of the amount of insurance recoveries likely to materialize in the future would have been significantly lower than the net amounts recognized in the balance sheet. Prior to the first quarter 2011 adjustment for the April 5, 2011 settlement agreement with Pneumo discussed below, Cooper estimated that the liability for pending and future indemnity and defense costs for the next 45 years was $736.3 million. This estimated liability was before any tax benefit and was not discounted as the timing of the actual payments on resolution of claims through the tort system was not reasonably predictable. The methodology used to project Coopers liability estimate relied upon a number of assumptions including Coopers recent claims experience and declining future asbestos spending based on past trends and publicly available epidemiological data, changes in various jurisdictions, managements judgment about the current and future litigation environment, and the availability to claimants of other payment sources. Under the Plan B settlement, Cooper, through Pneumo Abex LLC, had access to Abex insurance policies with remaining limits on policies with solvent insurers in excess of $660 million. Insurance recoveries reflected as receivables in the balance sheet included recoveries where insurance in place agreements, settlements or policy recoveries were considered probable. Prior to the first quarter 2011 adjustment for the April 5, 2011 settlement agreement with Pneumo discussed below, Coopers receivable for recoveries of costs from insurers amounted to $151.9 million. On February 1, 2011, Cooper entered into a settlement agreement that following satisfaction of various closing conditions closed on April 5, 2011. The settlement agreement terminated the Mutual Guaranty between Cooper and Pneumo and created a Settlement Trust. As a result of the April 2011 settlement the Company and its subsidiaries have no further obligations under the Mutual Guaranty. Under the settlement agreement, a subsidiary of Cooper will make payments to the Settlement Trust totaling $307.5 million, subject to certain reductions. Cooper made the $250 million initial payment to the Settlement Trust at the closing of the settlement agreement in April 2011 with the remaining payments due in installments over four years. As discussed above, Cooper had previously recorded an estimated accrual on an undiscounted basis for pending and future indemnity and defense costs under the Mutual Guaranty. In addition, Cooper had recorded receivables for related insurance recoveries where insurance in place agreements, settlements or policy recoveries were considered probable. As a result of the settlement agreement, Cooper adjusted its previously recorded net liability in the first quarter of 2011 for its obligations under the Mutual Guaranty to the amounts payable under the settlement agreement and related unpaid legal expenses resulting in the recognition of an after tax gain from discontinued operations of $190.3 million, which is net of a $105.6 million income tax expense. 35 Recently Issued Accounting Standards There are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that Cooper expects to have a material effect on the presentation or disclosure of our future consolidated operating results, cash flows or financial condition.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS On March 26, 2010, Cooper announced that it entered into a Framework Agreement with Danaher Corporation to create a joint venture combining Coopers Tools business with certain Tools businesses from Danahers Tools and Components Segment (the Joint Venture). On July 6, 2010, Cooper announced the completion of the Joint Venture, named Apex Tool Group, LLC. Cooper and Danaher each own a 50% interest in the Joint Venture, have equal representation on its Board of Directors and have a 50% voting interest in the Joint Venture. At completion of the transaction in July 2010 Cooper deconsolidated the Tools business assets and liabilities contributed to the Joint Venture and recognized Coopers 50% ownership interest as an equity investment. Recording the investment at its fair value of $480 million resulted in a pretax loss of $134.5 million related to the transaction, which was recognized in the second quarter 2010. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010 Cooper recognizes its proportionate share of the Joint Ventures operating results using the equity method. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions) Revenues Energy and Safety Solutions $ 2,926.5 $ 2,516.7 $ 2,416.6 Electrical Products Group 2,482.9 2,238.0 2,095.3 Total Electrical Segments 5,409.4 4,754.7 4,511.9 Tools 311.2 557.7 Total Revenues $ 5,409.4 $ 5,065.9 $ 5,069.6 See the geographic information included in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of revenues by country. 2011 vs. 2010 Revenues Revenues for 2011 increased 6.8% compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of the revenues from the now deconsolidated Tools segment, comparable revenues increased 13.8% in 2011 compared to 2010. Core revenues for the combined Electrical segments in 2011 were 9.9% higher than the prior year with acquisitions increasing revenues by 2.8% and currency translation increasing reported revenues by 1.1%. Energy & Safety Solutions segment revenues for 2011, which represent approximately 54% of the total revenues generated, increased 16.3% compared to 2010. Currency translation increased reported revenues by 1.6% while the impact of acquisitions increased the segment revenues by 2.9%. All of the businesses in the Energy & Safety Solutions segment reported increased revenues for 2011 as the utility and industrial markets saw strong double digit growth coupled with international developing market revenues increasing over 20%. Electrical Products Group segment revenues for 2011, which represent approximately 46% of the total revenues generated, increased 10.9% compared to 2010. Core revenues in 2011 were 7.7% higher than 2010 with currency translation increasing reported revenues by 0.5% and acquisitions adding 2.7% to reported revenues for 2011. All businesses in the Electrical Products Group segment reported increased revenues for 2011 driven by stronger industrial and electronic markets with particular strength and new products developed for energy efficient applications adding to the growth, partially offset by continued weakness in commercial markets. 2010 vs. 2009 Revenues Revenues for 2010 were essentially flat compared to 2009. Excluding the impact of the revenues from the now deconsolidated Tools segment, comparable revenues increased 5.4% in 2010 compared to 2009. Core revenues, excluding the impact of the deconsolidated Tools segment, were 4.8% higher than the prior year with acquisitions increasing revenues by 0.6% and currency translation having a minimal impact overall. 17 Energy & Safety Solutions segment revenues for 2010, which represented approximately 50% of the total revenues generated, increased 4.1% compared to 2009. Currency translation decreased reported revenues by 0.5% while the impact of acquisitions increased the segment revenues by 1.2%. All of the businesses in the Energy & Safety Solutions segment reported increased revenues for 2010 as the end markets for the segment showed improvement in the second half of the year, with international developing markets leading the recovery. Electrical Products Group segment revenues for 2010, which represented approximately 44% of the total revenues generated, increased 6.8% compared to 2009. Core revenues in 2010 were 6.3% higher than 2009 with currency translation increasing reported revenues by 0.5%. Three of the four businesses in the Electrical Products Group segment reported increased revenues for 2010 while the other business had an overall decline of less than 2%. Despite weakness in commercial markets through most of the year, the revenue growth was driven by stronger industrial and electronic markets with particular strength through international channels. Tools segment revenues for 2010, which represented about 6% of total revenues, decreased as a result of the July 6, 2010 formation of the Apex Tool Group, LLC joint venture. Prior to the deconsolidation of the segment at the beginning of the third quarter of 2010, revenues from recovering demand in the North American and Western European industrial markets increased Tools segment revenues 17.4% in the first half of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, including a 4.3% increase from currency translation. $00000000 $00000000 $00000000 Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions, except per share data) Operating Results Energy and Safety Solutions $ 494.3 $ 424.7 $ 374.9 Electrical Products Group 353.7 330.7 263.3 Total Electrical segments 848.0 755.4 638.2 Tools 33.1 18.5 Total segment operating earnings 848.0 788.5 656.7 General corporate expense 90.4 89.3 82.7 Equity in income of Apex Tool Group, LLC 66.8 22.8 Loss related to contribution of net assets to Apex Tool Group 134.5 Restructuring and other 4.0 8.0 29.9 Operating earnings 820.4 579.5 544.1 Interest expense, net 63.2 49.4 61.4 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 757.2 530.1 482.7 Income tax expense 119.9 86.3 69.1 Income from continuing operations 637.3 443.8 413.6 Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 190.3 25.5 Net income $ 827.6 $ 443.8 $ 439.1 Diluted earnings per share: Income from continuing operations $ 3.87 $ 2.64 $ 2.46 Income from discontinued operations 1.15 .15 Net income $ 5.02 $ 2.64 $ 2.61 18 Cooper measures the performance of its businesses exclusive of restructuring, asset impairment and financing expenses. All costs directly attributable to operating businesses are included in segment operating earnings. Corporate overhead costs, including costs of traditional headquarters activities, such as treasury, are not allocated to the businesses. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2011 vs. 2010 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $848.0 million in 2011, an increase of 8% compared to $788.5 million in 2010. Excluding the impact of the operating earnings from the now deconsolidated Tools segment, comparable operating earnings increased 12% in 2011 compared to 2010 on comparable revenue growth of 13.8%. Energy & Safety Solutions segment 2011 operating earnings increased 16% to $494.3 million from $424.7 million in 2010 on comparable revenue growth of 16.3%. Return on revenues was 16.9% for both 2011 and 2010. The favorable impact on margins of higher production volumes for selected products and the positive impact of Coopers activities to improve overall cost productivity was substantially offset by investments made in resources to accelerate new product development and global growth opportunities. Electrical Products Group segment 2011 operating earnings increased 7% to $353.7 million from $330.7 million for 2010 on revenue growth of 10.9%. Return on revenues was 14.2% for 2011 compared to 14.8% for 2010. The favorable leverage of fixed costs from improved demand from the recovery in selected global markets and the favorable impact of actions taken to adjust operating costs was more than offset by material price inflation not fully covered by pricing actions taken for selected product lines in 2011. In addition, investments made in resources to accelerate new product development and sales and marketing resources focused on driving improved global demand along with the acquisitions completed during the year also put downward pressure on the operating earnings as a percentage of revenues. Equity income from the Apex Tool Group joint venture is included in operating earnings commencing in the third quarter of 2010. Reported equity income from Apex Tool Group was $66.8 million for 2011 compared to the $22.8 million earned in the second half of 2010. Prior to the deconsolidation of the Tools segment at the beginning of the third quarter in 2010, the Tools segment reported $33.1 million in operating earnings for the first six months of 2010. The combined increase in earnings for the year was due to the leverage on improved global demand for industrial products in the Tools segment and the impact of restructuring actions taken since the formation of the joint venture. 2010 vs. 2009 Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings were $788.5 million in 2010, an increase of 20% compared to $656.7 million in 2009. Excluding the impact of the operating earnings from the now deconsolidated Tools segment, comparable operating earnings increased 18% in 2010 compared to 2009. Energy & Safety Solutions segment 2010 operating earnings increased 13% to $424.7 million from $374.9 million in 2009. Return on revenues was 16.9% for 2010 compared to 15.5% for 2009. Operating earnings in 2009 were favorably impacted by net inventory valuation adjustments (including decrements in LIFO inventory) of approximately $8 million. The increase in 2010 operating earnings resulted from favorable leverage of improving global market demand and the impact of restructuring actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2008. The investment in restructuring actions during 2009 and continuing in 2010 coupled with on going productivity improvements served to reduce the segments cost structure and improve return on revenues in 2010. Electrical Products Group segment 2010 operating earnings increased 26% to $330.7 million from $263.3 million for 2009. Return on revenues was 14.8% for 2010 compared to 12.6% for 2009. Operating earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted by net inventory valuation adjustments of approximately $5 million. The increase in 2010 operating earnings resulted from the positive leverage of fixed overhead due to improving global market demand and the impact of restructuring actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2008. The Electrical Products Group segments investment in restructuring actions during 2009 and continuing in 2010 coupled with on going productivity improvements served to reduce its cost structure and improve return on revenues in 2010. 19 Equity income from the Apex Tool Group joint venture is included in operating earnings commencing in the third quarter of 2010. Reported equity income from Apex Tool Group was $22.8 million in 2010. Prior to the deconsolidation of the Tools segment at the beginning of the third quarter in 2010, the Tools segment reported $33.1 million in operating earnings for the first six months of 2010 compared to $18.5 million for the full year of 2009. Tools return on revenues was 10.6% for the first six months of 2010 compared to 3.3% for the full year of 2009. The increase in earnings as a percentage of revenue was due to the leverage on improved global demand for industrial products in the Tools segment and the related impact of increased production volumes. Restructuring and Other In the fourth quarter of 2011 Cooper recorded a non cash write down of $4.0 million related to an international product line held for sale in the Electrical Products Group segment. Cooper expects to complete the sale of the product line in 2012. In 2010 Cooper recognized a pre tax restructuring charge of $8.0 million, or $6.4 million after taxes, reducing 2010 diluted earnings by $.04 per share. In 2009 Cooper recognized a pre tax restructuring charge of $28.7 million and a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $1.2 million. The 2009 restructuring and asset impairment charges of $29.9 million, or $24.4 million after taxes, reduced 2009 diluted earnings by $.14 per share. General Corporate Expense General Corporate expense increased $1.1 million during 2011 to $90.4 million compared to $89.3 million for 2010. The increase in General Corporate expense in 2011 is primarily related to normal wage inflation, higher environmental costs related to previously divested businesses, higher legal expenses and incremental costs associated with acquisitions, partially offset by cost actions taken to reduce overall General Corporate expense. General Corporate expense increased $6.6 million during 2010 to $89.3 million compared to $82.7 million for 2009. General Corporate expense in 2010 includes approximately $4 million for legal and environmental costs related to businesses disposed of in prior years and 2009 includes approximately $4 million in costs associated with the reincorporation of the Company to Ireland. The increase in General Corporate expense in 2010 is primarily related to higher long term performance based stock and incentive compensation compared to 2009. General Corporate expense in 2010 also includes approximately $2 million related to acquisition activities. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense for 2011 was $63.2 million, an increase of $13.8 million from 2010 primarily as a result of higher average debt balances, partially offset by a lower average interest rate on debt and higher interest income for 2011. Average debt balances were $1.42 billion and $965.8 million and average interest rates were 4.81% and 5.21% for 2011 and 2010, respectively. On December 7, 2010, Cooper issued $250 million of 2.375% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2016 and $250 million of 3.875% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2020. Net interest expense for 2010 was $49.4 million, a decrease of $12.0 million from 2009 primarily as a result of lower average debt balances. Average debt balances were $965.8 million and $1.17 billion and average interest rates were 5.21% and 5.36% for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income Tax Expense The effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations was 15.8% for 2011, 16.3% for 2010 and 14.3% for 2009. Income tax expense was reduced by $17.4 million, $5.6 million and $12.7 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for discrete tax items primarily related to statute expirations, tax settlements and other discrete items. In 2011 income tax expense for continuing operations was further reduced by $9.7 million for discrete tax adjustments related to the settlement of the discontinued operations asbestos liability that was required under accounting principles to be classified in continuing operations. In 2010 income tax expense was also reduced by $40.8 million to recognize the discrete tax effects related to the contribution of 20 net assets to the Tool joint venture. Excluding the discrete tax items noted above and the loss on the net asset contribution to the Apex Tool Group joint venture in 2010 Coopers effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 19.4%, 20.0% and 17.0%, respectively. Income Related to Discontinued Operations During 2009 Cooper recognized an after tax gain from discontinued operations of $25.5 million, which is net of a $16.2 million income tax expense (or $.15 per diluted share) related to its asbestos liability regarding the Automotive Products segment, which was sold in 1998. The income resulted from negotiated insurance settlements consummated during 2009 that were not previously recognized. As discussed in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on February 1, 2011, Cooper entered into a settlement agreement that closed on April 5, 2011 related to its asbestos liability regarding the Automotive Products segment. The settlement terminates the 1994 Mutual Guaranty Agreement between Cooper and Pneumo and creates a Settlement Trust. After the closing of the settlement in April 2011 the Company and its subsidiaries have no further obligations under the Mutual Guaranty Agreement. Under the settlement agreement, a subsidiary of Cooper will make payments to the Settlement Trust totaling $307.5 million ($250 million was paid at closing and the remainder is due in installments over four years, subject to certain adjustments). Cooper made the $250 million initial payment to the Settlement Trust on April 5, 2011. Other payments due under the settlement agreement total approximately $49.6 million, after certain reductions for indemnity and defense payments made by Cooper subsequent to the February 1, 2011 settlement agreement and prior to the closing on April 5, 2011. The remaining payments are due in installments at the anniversary of the closing over the next four years. As discussed in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Cooper had previously recorded an estimated accrual on an undiscounted basis for pending and future indemnity and defense costs under the Mutual Guaranty. In addition, Cooper had recorded receivables for related insurance recoveries where insurance in place agreements, settlements or policy recoveries were considered probable. As a result of the settlement agreement, Cooper adjusted is previously recorded net liability for its obligations under the Mutual Guaranty agreement to the amounts payable under the settlement agreement and related unpaid legal expenses as of March 31, 2011 resulting in the recognition in the first quarter of 2011 of an after tax gain from discontinued operations of $190.3 million, which is net of a $105.6 million income tax expense. Diluted Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $3.87 in 2011, $2.64 in 2010 and $2.46 in 2009. Net income in 2010 was reduced by the non cash after tax charge of $93.7 million, or $.56 per share related to the formation of the Tools joint venture. The increase in earnings per share for 2011, exclusive of the loss on the formation of the Tools joint venture, primarily resulted from the increase in operating earnings driven by the growth in sales and the benefit of lower common shares outstanding partially offset by higher net interest expense. The increase in earnings per share for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily resulted from improved operating earnings driven by the favorable leverage of improving global market demand and improved cost structure reflecting the benefits from restructuring actions previously taken partially offset by the loss on the formation of the Tools joint venture in 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Percentage of Revenues Cost of Sales: Energy and Safety Solutions 66.8 % 66.8 % 67.8 % Electrical Products Group 66.7 % 66.4 % 68.5 % Tools 69.0 % 74.1 % Selling and Administrative: Energy and Safety Solutions 16.3 % 16.3 % 16.7 % Electrical Products Group 19.0 % 18.8 % 18.9 % Tools 20.4 % 22.6 % 21 2011 vs 2010 Percentage of Revenues Energy & Safety Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 66.8% for both 2011 and 2010. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was essentially unchanged as the favorable impact of the higher absorption of production costs from the improved global demand coupled with productivity improvements were substantially offset by planned investments in additional research and development for new products and incremental costs associated with the consolidation of facilities to improve the overall manufacturing cost structure. Electrical Products Group segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 66.7% for 2011 compared to 66.4% for 2010. The increase in 2011 cost of sales, as a percentage of revenue, resulted from increased investment in new product development and higher than average cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for newly acquired business coupled with the segments inability to fully offset material price inflation with pricing actions for selected product lines. These items were partially offset by on going productivity improvements targeted to reduce the segments cost structure and the higher absorption of production costs from the improved global demand. Energy & Safety Solutions segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.3% for both 2011 and 2010. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was effectively flat for the segment primarily as a result of the favorable impact by leverage from increased revenues being offset by investments made in global infrastructure to enhance future growth opportunities and the higher than average selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues for newly acquired businesses. Electrical Products Group segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 19.0% for 2011 compared to 18.8% for 2010. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was the result of investments in global infrastructure to support future global growth opportunities and the higher than average selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues for newly acquired businesses partially offset by the favorable impact by leverage from increased revenues. 2010 vs 2009 Percentage of Revenues Energy & Safety Solutions segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 66.8% for 2010 compared to 67.8% for 2009. The decrease in costs of sales as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of the higher absorption of production costs from the improved global demand coupled with productivity improvements and cost reduction actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2008. Electrical Products Group segment cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was 66.4% for 2010 compared to 68.5% for 2009. The decrease in costs of sales as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of the higher absorption of production costs from the improved global demand and productivity improvements and cost reduction actions taken since the fourth quarter of 2008. Tools segment cost of sales reflects reported segment results for the first six months of 2010 prior to the formation of the Apex Tool Group joint venture. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales for the Tools segment was 69.0% for the first half of 2010 compared to 74.1% for the full year of 2009. The decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was due to the higher absorption of production costs from higher volumes and productivity improvements and cost reduction actions taken during 2008 and 2009. Energy & Safety Solutions segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.3% for 2010 compared to 16.7% for 2009. The decrease in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of favorable impact by leverage from increased revenues. Electrical Products Group segment selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, for 2010 was 18.8% compared to 18.9% for 2009. The decrease in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was favorably impacted by leverage from increased revenues; partially offset by investments in global infrastructure to support future global growth opportunities. Tools segment selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2010 was 20.4% compared to 22.6% for 2009, reflecting the favorable impact from improved revenues. Cooper incurs certain costs that are not directly attributable to the operating segments that are reflected as General Corporate expenses. See the General Corporate Expense section above. 22 Earnings Outlook The following sets forth Coopers general business outlook for 2012 based on current expectations. Cooper expects revenues for the Energy and Safety Solutions segment in 2012 to be up 4 to 6% as the result of continued demand from global industrial markets and utility markets partially offset by flat demand expected for products serving the commercial construction markets. The revenues for the Electrical Products Group in 2012 are expected to be up in a range of 5 to 7% on continued global industrial and electronic component demand which is expected to be partially offset by flat demand for products serving the commercial construction markets. Operating earnings are expected to improve from continued focus on productivity improvements and the favorable leverage of fixed costs from the higher global market demands. Cooper is expecting diluted continuing earnings per share to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.35. Pricing and Volume In each of Coopers segments, the nature of many of the products sold is such that an accurate determination of the changes in unit volume of sales is neither practical nor, in some cases, meaningful. Each segment produces a family of products, within which there exist considerable variations in size, configuration and other characteristics. Unit volumes in all segments increased during 2011 with the improvement in global demand favorably impacting all of Coopers businesses. Unit volumes increased in 2010 compared to 2009 levels with the end of the global recession improving global demand favorably impacting all of Coopers businesses. During the first half of 2011 Cooper was unable to fully offset inflationary costs for commodities by available market price increases primarily in certain product lines with heavy material content. During the second half of 2011 Cooper began to recover pricing in relation to material costs for those selected product lines and ended 2011 with pricing slightly below overall material inflation. During the first half of 2010 Cooper experienced favorable customer pricing from actions taken during the period. During the second half of 2010 Cooper was unable to fully offset inflationary costs for commodities by available market price increases primarily in certain product lines with heavy material content. During the first half of 2009 Cooper recognized favorable year over year customer pricing impacts from actions taken during 2008. The second half of 2009 saw a decline in customer pricing as commodity prices weakened from their 2008 elevated levels. During 2009 Cooper was able to maintain a positive benefit from the difference between price realization and material inflation/deflation. Cooper has aggressively acted to control and reduce costs during the three year period through strategic sourcing, manufacturing improvement and rationalization efforts in order to improve profitability in the segments. Effect of Inflation With the continued improvement in global economies during 2011, the pricing of commodities used in the manufacture of certain products escalated. During the first half of 2011 Cooper was unable to fully offset the inflationary costs for commodities by available market price increases in selected product lines with heavy material content. The impact of these inflationary pressures was partially offset through productivity improvements. During the second half of 2011 Cooper overall realized price increases slightly above material purchase cost increases. During 2010 as the global economies improved, the pricing of commodities used in the manufacture of certain products escalated. Through the first half of 2010 Cooper realized price increases and productivity improvements at least equal to material purchase cost increases. During the second half of 2010 Cooper was unable to fully offset the inflationary costs for commodities by available market price increases with the impact of these inflationary pressures partially offset through productivity improvements. 23 During 2009 as the global economies showed some signs of recovery, the pricing of commodities used in the manufacture of certain products began to escalate. However, in 2009 the overall mix of inflationary and deflationary material costs was not significant and Cooper was able to maintain customer pricing sufficient to offset the changing commodity costs. Cooper endeavors to mitigate the price volatility of selected commodities such as copper and steel through the use of derivatives and supply agreements. The impact of changes to these commodity costs could impact margins for several quarters as a result of this activity. Coopers on going initiatives to improve productivity and rationalize its operational base have mitigated increases in employee compensation and benefits, as well as general inflation on operating costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cooper believes our internal cash generation together with existing cash and cash equivalent balances and availability under the committed credit facility is sufficient to fund current operations, projected capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, the current rate of cash dividends, and anticipated common stock repurchases. Cooper evaluates opportunities to expand through acquisitions as well as through the growth of our current businesses. While a significant acquisition may require additional debt and or equity financing, Cooper believes its conservative financial structure and access to capital markets provides the strength and flexibility to support the liquidity needs to achieve its strategic objectives. Operating Working Capital For purposes of this discussion, operating working capital is defined as receivables and inventories less accounts payable. Coopers operating working capital increased $70.3 million during 2011 reflecting growth from acquisitions and working capital investments to support revenue growth and global growth initiatives. A $82.9 million increase in accounts receivable and a $27.4 million increase in inventories were partially offset by a $40.0 million increase in accounts payable. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annualized quarterly revenues divided by average quarterly operating working capital) in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 6.0 turns compared to 6.1 turns for the same period of 2010, reflecting efficient utilization of operating working capital. Coopers operating working capital decreased $1.9 million during 2010, exclusive of the Tools business contributed to Apex Tool Group in July 2010. A $98.2 million increase in accounts receivable and a $15.0 million increase in inventories offset by a $115.1 million increase in accounts payable were driven primarily by the 5.4% increase in total Electrical segment sales offset by aggressive actions to improve Coopers vendor terms and conditions. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annualized quarterly revenues divided by average quarterly operating working capital) for the fourth quarter of 2010 was 6.1 turns compared to 5.6 turns for the same period of 2009, reflecting efficient utilization of operating working capital. Coopers operating working capital decreased $263.5 million during 2009. A $213.7 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $157.9 million decrease in inventories partially offset by a $108.1 million decrease in accounts payable were driven primarily by a 22% decrease in sales and aggressive actions to right size Coopers businesses for current market conditions. Coopers operating working capital at December 31, 2009 was approximately 23% lower than at December 31, 2008, as operating working capital levels were adjusted to the current lower operating levels. Operating working capital turnover (defined as annualized quarterly revenues divided by average quarterly operating working capital) for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 5.4 turns compared to 4.9 turns for the same period of 2008. 24 Cash Flows As discussed above and in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Coopers contingent liabilities related to the Automotive Products sale to Federal Mogul in 1998 were resolved on April 5, 2011 with the closing of a settlement agreement with Pneumo Abex LLC. The settlement agreement terminated the 1994 Mutual Guaranty Agreement between Cooper and Pneumo and requires Cooper to make payments totaling $307.5 million, subject to certain reductions, to a settlement trust. Cooper used existing cash on hand to make the $250 million initial payment to the settlement trust at the closing of the settlement agreement in April 2011 with the remaining payments due in installments over four years. Net cash provided by operating activities was $561.3 million during 2011, inclusive of the $250 million asbestos settlement payment discussed above. This cash, plus an additional $358.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $70.7 million of cash received from stock option exercises, was primarily used to fund total share purchases of $395.5 million, acquisitions of $304.7 million, dividends of $187.7 million and capital expenditures of $125.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $700.5 million during 2010. On December 7, 2010, Cooper issued $250 million of 2.375% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2016 and $250 million of 3.875% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2020. The cash from operating activities, plus net debt proceeds of $494.0 million from the December 2010 issuance and $81.4 million of cash received from stock option exercises resulted in more than a $600 million increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2010 after funding share purchases of $276.1 million, dividends of $177.4 million, capital expenditures of $98.5 million, and acquisitions of $93.2. Net cash provided by operating activities was $751.9 million during 2009. Cash provided by operating activities in 2009 is net of a $90 million payment related to a German tax dispute (see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information) and a $25 million voluntary contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The cash from operating activities, plus $22.9 million from redemption of short term investments and $20.1 million of cash received from stock option exercises was primarily used to fund debt repayments of $299.6 million, dividends of $167.4 million, capital expenditures of $126.7 million, acquisitions of $61.4 million, and share purchases of $38.5 million. On November 2, 2009, Cooper repaid the $275 million 5.5% senior unsecured notes at maturity with existing cash. Debt At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Cooper had cash and cash equivalents of $676.6 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, Cooper had short term debt of $6.4 million and $7.7 million, respectively. Cooper had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010. Coopers practice is to back up its short term debt balance with a combination of cash, cash equivalents, and committed credit facilities. On May 26, 2011, Cooper entered into a credit agreement that provides a $500 million five year committed bank credit facility that replaced Coopers previous credit facility that was to mature in August 2012. The credit facility agreement is not subject to termination based on a decrease in Coopers debt ratings or a material adverse change clause. The only financial covenant in the agreement limits Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio to 60%. Cooper is in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit facility agreement. At December 31, 2011, Cooper has $500 million available under this credit facility. Coopers access to the commercial paper market could be adversely affected by a change in the credit ratings assigned to its commercial paper. Should Coopers access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in its credit ratings, Cooper would rely on a combination of available cash and its committed credit facility to provide short term funding. The committed credit facility does not contain any provision which makes its availability to Cooper dependent on Coopers credit ratings. 25 Coopers senior unsecured notes, credit facility and any commercial paper amounts outstanding are guaranteed by Cooper and certain of its principal operating subsidiaries. On December 7, 2010, Coopers wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper US, Inc. issued $250 million of 2.375% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2016 and $250 million of 3.875% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2020. Proceeds from the financing were initially invested in highly liquid investments and available for general corporate purposes. Combined with the debt issuance discount, underwriting commissions and interest rate hedges implemented in anticipation of the offering, the 2016 notes have an effective annual cost to Cooper of 2.56% and the 2020 notes have an effective annual cost to Cooper of 4.02%. On March 27, 2008, Coopers wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper US, Inc. issued $300 million of 5.45% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2015. Proceeds from the financing were used to repay commercial paper outstanding at that time. Combined with the debt issuance discount, underwriting commissions and interest rate hedges implemented in anticipation of the offering, the notes have an effective annual cost to Cooper of 5.56%. On June 18, 2007, Coopers wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper US, Inc. issued $300 million of 6.10% fixed rate senior unsecured notes due in 2017. Proceeds from the financing were used to repay $300 million of maturing 5.25% senior unsecured notes. Combined with interest rate hedges implemented in anticipation of the offering, the notes have an effective annual cost to Cooper of 5.75%. On November 8, 2005, Coopers wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper US, Inc., issued $325 million of 5.25% fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on November 15, 2012. Proceeds of the notes were swapped to 272.6 million with cross currency interest rate swaps, effectively converting the seven year U.S. notes to seven year Euro notes with an annual interest rate of 3.55%. The proceeds of 272.6 million partially funded repayment of the 6.25% Euro bonds that matured in October 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Cooper executes stand by letters of credit, performance bonds and other guarantees in the normal course of business that ensure Coopers performance or payments to third parties. The aggregate notional value of these instruments was $118.0 million and $108.7 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Approximately eighty percent of these instruments have an expiration date within one year. In the past, no significant claims have been made against these financial instruments. Management believes the likelihood of demand for payment under these instruments is minimal and expects no material cash outlays to occur in connection with these instruments. The following table summarizes Coopers contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Payments Due Total Less thanOne Year One toThree Years Four toFiveYears AfterFiveYears (in millions) Contractual Obligations: Long Term Debt $ 1,426.5 $ 325.0 $ 0.6 $ 550.0 $ 550.9 Short Term Debt 6.4 6.4 Interest Payments on Long Term Debt 298.0 67.2 100.6 73.1 57.1 Noncancellable Operating Leases 102.6 24.0 36.5 21.6 20.5 Purchase Obligations 278.5 277.2 1.3 Other Long Term Liabilities (1), (2) 222.1 16.2 30.9 29.6 145.4 $ 2,334.1 $ 716.0 $ 169.9 $ 674.3 $ 773.9 26 (1) Includes unfunded other postretirement benefit obligations, unfunded defined benefit pension plan liabilities and environmental liabilities. Also includes liabilities for underfunded U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans. (2) Due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with Coopers unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, Cooper is unable to make reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $8.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. Capitalization On February 9, 2009, Coopers Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of ten million shares of common stock and increased the share repurchase authorization by ten million shares on November 1, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, 13,679,395 shares remain available to be repurchased under the authorizations by the Board of Directors. Coopers Board has also authorized the repurchase of shares issued from time to time under its equity compensation plans, matched savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan in order to offset the dilution that results from issuing shares under these plans. For 2012 Coopers current estimate is that 2.5 million shares would be issued under equity compensation plans. Cooper may continue to repurchase shares under these authorizations from time to time during 2012. The decision whether to do so will depend on the favorability of market conditions, as well as potential cash requirements for acquisitions and debt repayments. Cooper targets a 30% to 40% debt to total capitalization ratio. Excess cash flows are utilized to fund acquisitions or to purchase shares of Cooper common stock. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Coopers debt to total capitalization ratio was 28.8%, 30.8% and 24.0%, respectively. Cash dividends of $.25 a share were declared on Cooper Industries plcs common shares on November 3, 2009 that were paid on January 4, 2010. Cash dividends declared on Cooper Industries plcs common shares were $.27 a share per quarter ($1.08 on an annualized basis) during 2010 and $.29 a share per quarter ($1.16 on an annualized basis) during 2011. Coopers Board of Directors declared annual cash dividends of $1.16, $1.08 and $1.00 per share for the years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On February 14, 2012, Coopers Board of Directors increased the annual dividend rate of Coopers common stock by $.08 per share to $1.24 per share. Capital Expenditures and Commitments Capital expenditures on projects to reduce product costs, improve product quality, increase manufacturing efficiency and operating flexibility, or expand production capacity were $125 million in 2011, $99 million in 2010 and $127 million in 2009. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $130 to $150 million in 2012. Projected expenditures for 2012 will focus on capacity expansions in key markets, development of new products and cost reduction programs. Interest Rate, Currency and Commodity Price Risk Changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices affect Coopers earnings and cash flows. As a result of having sales, purchases and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies used by Coopers businesses, Cooper is exposed to the effect of exchange rate changes on its cash flows and earnings. Cooper enters into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge significant non functional currency denominated transactions for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions. Contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed one year. 27 The table below provides information about Coopers derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments at December 31, 2011 that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates and weighted average interest rates in effect during the periods presented. $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 $325.0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total ($ in millions) Long term debt: Fixed rate (U.S. Dollar) $ 325.4 $ 0.4 $ 0.5 $ 300.2 $ 250.0 $ 550.0 $ 1426.5 Average interest rate 4.8 % 4.7 % 4.7 % 4.7 % 4.3 % 4.8 % 4.8 % Cross currency swaps: Fixed to fixed: Notional amount (1) $ 325.0 $ $ $ $ $ $ 325.0 Average pay rate 3.5 % 3.5 % Average receive rate 5.2 % 5.2 % (1) Cooper entered into cross currency swaps to effectively convert $325 million of 5.25% senior unsecured debt due in November 2012 to 272.6 million with an annual interest rate of approximately 3.5%.

Changes in availability and fluctuations in commodity prices for raw materials such as steel, copper, aluminum and zinc affect Coopers earnings and cash flows. Cooper primarily manages this exposure through price changes; however, in periods of significant increases in commodity prices, the price increases in certain businesses, on occasion, lag the increased costs. Cooper also uses commodity swaps to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations on a portion of certain forecasted material purchases for copper, aluminum and zinc for periods up to eighteen months. At December 31, 2011, Cooper has commodity swaps with a notional amount of approximately $14 million, all of which mature in 2012. At December 31, 2010, Cooper had commodity swaps with a notional amount of approximately $14 million, all of which matured in 2011. 28 The table below provides information about Coopers currency forward exchange contracts to purchase currencies in excess of $10 million at December 31, 2011.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Cooper believes the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods, assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts. Cooper recognizes revenues when products are shipped, and accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience. If actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, adjustments to our allowances may be required. The accrual for sales returns and other allowances reported net in receivables was $64.0 million and $59.1 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Cooper provides certain customers incentives primarily consisting of volume discounts and other short term discount and promotion programs. Cooper recognizes these incentives as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of the qualifying sale based on our estimate of the ultimate incentive amount to be earned using historical experience and known trends. If actual customer incentives differ from our estimates, adjustments to our accruals may be required. The accrual for customer incentives reported in accrued liabilities was $92.8 million and $77.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Allowances for excess and obsolete inventory are provided based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, adjustments to our inventory allowances may be required. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $65.8 million at December 31, 2011 and $57.8 million at December 31, 2010. Pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, discount rates and estimated future employee earnings and demographics. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Differences between actuarial assumptions and estimates and actual experience are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity as actuarial net gains and losses. Actuarial net gains and losses in excess of a calculated minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service period of active employees. Total net periodic pension benefit cost was $10.2 million in 2011, $16.6 million in 2010 and $26.1 million in 2009. The decrease in the net periodic pension cost in 2011 primarily resulted from lower interest costs and the favorable impact from lower amortization of actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity as well as other actuarial changes. The decrease in the net periodic pension cost in 2010 resulted from a partial recovery in the fair value of the plan assets from the lower values related to the deterioration in the securities markets in 2008, contribution of certain pension plans to the Tools joint venture in July 2010 and other actuarial changes. The estimated net periodic pension benefit cost of $6.6 million for 2012 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 4.0% and an expected return on plan assets of 8.25%. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The postretirement benefits other than pensions liability is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of postretirement benefits expense. Differences between assumptions and actual experience are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity as actuarial net gains and losses. Actuarial net gains and losses in excess of a minimum annual amount are amortized and recognized 31 in net periodic postretirement benefit cost over the average remaining life expectancy of the participants. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost was ($1.6) million in 2011, $0.7 million in 2010 and ($0.4) million in 2009. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost is expected to be approximately ($4.1) million in 2012, assuming a discount rate of 4.0%. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Stock based compensation expense is recorded for stock option grants, performance based and restricted stock awards based upon fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period and considering expected achievement of performance goals for performance based awards. If goal level assumptions are not met, stock based compensation expense is adjusted and previously recognized compensation expense would be reversed. The fair value of stock option awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model, which includes assumptions for volatility, expected term, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on Cooper stock, historical volatility of Cooper stock and other factors. Historical data is used to estimate employee termination experience and the expected term of the options. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair value of performance based and restricted stock awards granted is measured at the market price on the grant date with performance based shares adjusted, if applicable, for the fair value of a total shareholder return modifier. Performance awards are typically arranged in levels, with increasing number of shares earned as higher levels of growth are achieved. For performance based awards granted during 2009, performance goals were tied to achieving a net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio in 2009 with vesting occurring over a three year period. For performance based awards granted during 2010 and 2011, performance goals are tied to achieving defined performance metrics over a three year performance period including cumulative compound growth in earnings per share, cumulative ratio of converting continuing income to free cash flow and a modifier to adjust the awards otherwise earned based on Coopers performance relative to its 15 company peer group as measured by total shareholder returns. The amount of the performance based award earned based on achievement of earnings per share and cash flow metrics is increased 10% if Coopers total shareholder return ranks in the top third of its peer group or decreased 10% if Coopers total shareholder return ranks in the bottom third of its peer group. Total stock based compensation expense was $37.6 million in 2011, $32.0 million in 2010 and $26.3 million in 2009. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites owned by Cooper and third party sites where Cooper was determined to be a potentially responsible party. Third party sites frequently involve multiple potentially responsible parties and Coopers potential liability is determined based on estimates of Coopers proportionate responsibility for the total cleanup. The amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates as well as an assessment of the financial capacity of the other potentially responsible parties. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, Coopers estimate of its environmental liabilities may change. The liability for environmental remediation was $28.0 million at December 31, 2011 and $21.4 million at December 31, 2010. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cooper records current tax liabilities as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities for those taxes incurred as a result of current operations but deferred until future periods. The annual provision for income taxes is the sum of both the current and deferred tax amounts. Current taxes payable represents the liability related to Coopers income tax returns for the current year, while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on Coopers consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based upon differences between the book basis of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as measured by the enacted tax rates that Cooper expects will be in effect when these differences reverse. In addition to estimating the future applicable tax rates, Cooper must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets. Cooper has established valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 32 Cooper is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous non U.S. jurisdictions. Cooper is regularly under examination by various tax authorities. United States federal and state tax authorities and tax authorities in other countries have challenged the amount of taxes due for certain tax periods. Cooper evaluates the potential exposure associated with various filing positions and records a liability for tax contingencies. Although Cooper believes all tax positions are reasonable and properly reported in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations in effect during the periods involved, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. The resolution of tax audits and litigation could have a material effect on Coopers consolidated cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is finalized. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, income tax expense was reduced by $17.4 million, $5.6 million and $12.7 million, respectively, as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations, tax settlements and other discrete tax items. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 1993 Cooper completed an initial public offering of the stock of Belden, formerly a division of Cooper. Under the agreement, Belden and Cooper made an election that increased the tax basis of certain Belden assets. Belden is required to pay Cooper ninety percent of the amount by which Belden has actually reduced tax payments that would otherwise have been payable if the increase in the tax basis of assets had not occurred, as realized principally over fifteen years. If Belden does not have sufficient future taxable income, it is possible that Belden will not be able to utilize the tax deductions arising from the increase in the tax basis of the assets resulting in a tax loss carryforward. Belden is not obligated to pay Cooper until a tax loss carryforward is utilized. Belden can carry any loss forward twenty years to offset future taxable income. Cooper has not recognized any income from the Belden agreement since 2007. Although Cooper believes that future payments remain under the Belden agreement, Cooper and Belden are currently in dispute over the amount and status of any remaining payments under the agreement. Although the outcome of the dispute cannot be determined with certainty, Cooper does not believe the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse effect on Coopers consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows. Cooper has goodwill of $2.51 billion and $2.36 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Cooper records goodwill related to business acquisitions when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of identified assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test and Cooper has designated January 1 as the date of this test. If an event occurs, or circumstances change, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value; an interim impairment test would be performed between annual tests. Cooper has identified seven reporting units, consisting of three units in the Energy and Safety Solutions reportable operating segment and four units in the Electrical Products Group reportable operating segment for which goodwill is tested for impairment. Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying amount of its goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (e.g., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit). The primary technique we utilize in estimating the fair value of our reporting units is discounted cash flow analysis. Discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgments, estimates and assumptions, many of which are interdependent, about future sales, operating margins, growth rates, capital expenditures, working capital and discount rates. In addition to estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units using discounted cash flow analysis, we compare the sum of the fair values of our reporting units that resulted from the discounted cash flow analysis to our market capitalization to determine that our estimates of reporting unit fair value are reasonable. 33 The starting point for the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis is the annual long range financial forecast which projects our future results for a three year period. The annual planning process that we undertake to prepare the long range financial forecast takes into consideration a multitude of factors including historical growth rates and operating performance, related industry trends, macroeconomic conditions, inflationary and deflationary forces, pricing strategies, customer analysis, operational issues, competitor analysis, customer needs and marketplace data, among others. Assumptions are also made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long range financial forecast period. Our estimates of fair value are sensitive to changes in all of these variables, certain of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside our control. The long range financial forecast is typically completed early in the fourth quarter of each year, and it serves as the primary basis for our estimate of reporting unit fair values used in our annual impairment tests, absent significant changes in our outlook on future results. To determine the outlook beyond the horizon of the long range financial forecast period, we estimated a 3% annual growth rate beyond 2014 to arrive at a normalized residual year representing the perpetual cash flows of each reporting unit. The forecasted 3% annual growth rate is less than Coopers historical compounded annual growth rate achieved through 2011 for the prior five and ten year periods. The residual year cash flow was capitalized to arrive at the terminal value for each of the reporting units. Utilizing a discount rate of 11% for each reporting unit, the present value of the cash flows during the projection period and terminal value were aggregated to estimate the fair value for each of the reporting units at January 1, 2012. We assumed a discount rate of 12% in our discounted cash flow analysis at January 1, 2011 for each of our reporting units. In determining the appropriate discount rate, we considered the weighted average cost of capital for market participants. As a result of the continued recovery in 2011 from the global economic environment seen in late 2008 and into 2010, we determined that the excess fair value for each of our reporting units over its carrying value as of January 1, 2012 has improved compared with such excess as of January 1, 2011, with the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeded carrying value improving more than 18% for each of our reporting units. Based on our fair value estimates as of January 1, 2012 for each reporting unit, the fair value estimates would have to be reduced by more than 45% to reduce such fair value to the reporting units carrying value. To evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations and to address the uncertainty inherent in estimating the fair values of our reporting units, we applied a range of discount rates and long term cash flow growth assumptions. Discount rates applied ranged from 9% to 13% with long term cash flow growth assumptions ranging from 0% to 5%. Under this range of assumptions, no scenario would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. If the global economic environment significantly worsens it is possible the estimated fair values of certain reporting units could decrease such that the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be completed. In addition to estimating the fair value of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flow analysis as described above, we compared the sum of the fair values of our reporting units that resulted from the discounted cash flow analysis to our market capitalization to determine that our estimates of reporting unit fair value were reasonable. As of December 31, 2011, our equity market capitalization was approximately $8.7 billion, compared to the $3.5 billion book value of equity. As of December 31, 2010, our equity market capitalization was approximately $9.7 billion, compared to the $3.2 billion book value of equity. There are significant inherent uncertainties and management judgment involved in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, it is possible that a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with our current estimates and assumptions, or if changes in macroeconomic conditions outside the control of management change such that it results in a significant negative impact on our estimated fair values, we may be required to perform the second step of the impairment test for one or more of our reporting units, which could result in a material impairment of our goodwill. 34 In October 1998 Cooper sold its Automotive Products business to Federal Mogul Corporation (Federal Mogul). These discontinued businesses (including the Abex Friction product line obtained from Pneumo Abex Corporation (Pneumo) in 1994) were operated through subsidiary companies, and the stock of those subsidiaries was sold to Federal Mogul pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 17, 1998 (1998 Agreement). In conjunction with the sale, Federal Mogul indemnified Cooper for certain liabilities of these subsidiary companies, including liabilities related to the Abex Friction product line and any potential liability that Cooper may have to Pneumo pursuant to a 1994 Mutual Guaranty Agreement (the Mutual Guaranty) between Cooper and Pneumo. On October 1, 2001, Federal Mogul and several of its affiliates filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. The Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed Federal Moguls plan of reorganization and Federal Mogul emerged from bankruptcy in December 2007. As part of Federal Moguls Plan of Reorganization, Cooper and Federal Mogul reached a settlement agreement that was subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court resolving Federal Moguls indemnification obligations to Cooper. On September 30, 2008, the Bankruptcy Court issued its final ruling denying Coopers participation in the proposed Federal Mogul 524(g) trust resulting in Cooper implementing the previously approved Plan B Settlement, where Cooper continued to resolve through the tort system the asbestos related claims arising from the Abex Friction product line that it had sold to Federal Mogul in 1998. As discussed further below, on February 1, 2011, Cooper entered into a settlement agreement that closed on April 5, 2011 resolving Coopers liability under the Mutual Guaranty with Pneumo. The amounts recognized by Cooper for its asbestos liability and related insurance receivables under the Plan B settlement were not discounted and relied on assumptions that were based on currently known facts and strategy. The value of the liability on a discounted basis net of the amount of insurance recoveries likely to materialize in the future would have been significantly lower than the net amounts recognized in the balance sheet. Prior to the first quarter 2011 adjustment for the April 5, 2011 settlement agreement with Pneumo discussed below, Cooper estimated that the liability for pending and future indemnity and defense costs for the next 45 years was $736.3 million. This estimated liability was before any tax benefit and was not discounted as the timing of the actual payments on resolution of claims through the tort system was not reasonably predictable. The methodology used to project Coopers liability estimate relied upon a number of assumptions including Coopers recent claims experience and declining future asbestos spending based on past trends and publicly available epidemiological data, changes in various jurisdictions, managements judgment about the current and future litigation environment, and the availability to claimants of other payment sources. Under the Plan B settlement, Cooper, through Pneumo Abex LLC, had access to Abex insurance policies with remaining limits on policies with solvent insurers in excess of $660 million. Insurance recoveries reflected as receivables in the balance sheet included recoveries where insurance in place agreements, settlements or policy recoveries were considered probable. Prior to the first quarter 2011 adjustment for the April 5, 2011 settlement agreement with Pneumo discussed below, Coopers receivable for recoveries of costs from insurers amounted to $151.9 million. On February 1, 2011, Cooper entered into a settlement agreement that following satisfaction of various closing conditions closed on April 5, 2011. The settlement agreement terminated the Mutual Guaranty between Cooper and Pneumo and created a Settlement Trust. As a result of the April 2011 settlement the Company and its subsidiaries have no further obligations under the Mutual Guaranty. Under the settlement agreement, a subsidiary of Cooper will make payments to the Settlement Trust totaling $307.5 million, subject to certain reductions. Cooper made the $250 million initial payment to the Settlement Trust at the closing of the settlement agreement in April 2011 with the remaining payments due in installments over four years. As discussed above, Cooper had previously recorded an estimated accrual on an undiscounted basis for pending and future indemnity and defense costs under the Mutual Guaranty. In addition, Cooper had recorded receivables for related insurance recoveries where insurance in place agreements, settlements or policy recoveries were considered probable. As a result of the settlement agreement, Cooper adjusted its previously recorded net liability in the first quarter of 2011 for its obligations under the Mutual Guaranty to the amounts payable under the settlement agreement and related unpaid legal expenses resulting in the recognition of an after tax gain from discontinued operations of $190.3 million, which is net of a $105.6 million income tax expense. 35 Recently Issued Accounting Standards There are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that Cooper expects to have a material effect on the presentation or disclosure of our future consolidated operating results, cash flows or financial condition.
