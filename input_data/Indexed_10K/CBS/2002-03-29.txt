Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. (Tabular dollars in millions) General Managements discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of Viacom Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Viacom" or the "Company") should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Several events occurred during 2001 and 2000 that affect the comparability of the Companys historical results for the periods presented. The significant events were as follows: In the second half of 2001, Blockbuster, a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, recorded primarily non cash charges of approximately $395 million, principally related to the elimination of less productive VHS tapes as part of its strategic re merchandising plan to transition from VHS to the higher margin DVD rental market and a change in amortization. The Companys 2001 results were impacted by lost revenues and increased costs attributable to the events of September 11 and by the challenging economic environment experienced during the year. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized restructuring charges of approximately $67 million at MTV Networks associated with a reduction in workforce and $53 million at United Paramount Network ("UPN") associated with the integration of UPN into CBS Network operations. In February 2001, the Company completed a merger with Infinity Broadcasting Corporation ("Infinity"), acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock that it did not already own for a purchase price of approximately $13.4 billion. In January 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of BET Holdings II, Inc. ("BET") for approximately $3 billion, consisting principally of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption of debt. In May 2000, the Company completed its merger with CBS Corporation ("CBS") (the "Viacom/CBS Merger") for a purchase price of approximately $39.8 billion. In the third quarter of 2000, Infinity completed the acquisition of 18 radio stations from Clear Channel Communications, Inc. ("Clear Channel") for approximately $1.4 billion in an asset transaction. In the second quarter of 2000, Infinity completed the acquisition of Giraudy, one of Frances largest outdoor advertising companies, for approximately $400 million. II 3 Business Segment Information The Company operates six reportable business segments: Cable Networks Basic cable and premium subscription television program services. Television Television networks and stations; and production and distribution of television programming. Infinity Radio stations and outdoor advertising properties. Entertainment Production and distribution of motion pictures; as well as the operation of movie theaters, theme parks and music publishing. Video Home videocassette, DVD and video game rental and retail operations. Publishing Consumer publishing. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company operated its online businesses under the Cable Networks and Television segments and accordingly, the online businesses are presented as part of these respective segments. Prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the new presentation. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company operates its publishing business under the Entertainment segment and will present its publishing business as part of that segment from that date forward. The following tables set forth revenues and operating income (loss) by business segment, as reported for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

II 4 EBITDA The following table sets forth EBITDA (defined as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, principally of goodwill related to business combinations) for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. The Company believes that EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operating performance of its segments. However, EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, net earnings, cash flows, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). As EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Pro forma results are also adjusted to exclude special item charges, including the 2001 Blockbuster charges, MTVN and UPN restructuring charges, the second quarter 2000 merger related charges as well as transactions with divested investments. The pro forma results are also adjusted to reflect the deconsolidation as of January 1, 2000, of iWon.com, which was previously a minority owned consolidated subsidiary. The pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the transactions actually occurred at the beginning of 2000, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results. The table below presents a reconciliation of the Companys reported revenues, operating income and EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, to the pro forma results presented for these respective periods.

Reported results are not comparable as the 2000 results only reflect eight months of CBS operations effective from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger, May 4, 2000. On a pro forma basis, revenues were $23.2 billion for 2001 versus revenues of $23.1 billion for 2000, with growth in all of the Companys operating segments, with the exception of Infinity. On a reported basis, total expenses increased 16% to $21.8 billion for 2001 from $18.7 billion for 2000 reflecting normal increases associated with revenue growth and twelve months of expenses for the combined companies including goodwill amortization expense associated with the Viacom/CBS Merger II 7 versus eight months of expenses, including amortization for the combined companies in 2000. On a pro forma basis, total expenses remained relatively constant at $21.2 billion for both years. On a reported basis, EBITDA and operating income increased 28% to $4.5 billion and 11% to $1.5 billion, respectively, for 2001 from $3.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, for 2000. On a pro forma basis, both EBITDA and operating income increased 2% with growth in the Cable Networks and Video segments. Segment Results of Operations 2001 versus 2000 Cable Networks (Basic Cable and Premium Subscription Television Program Services) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2001 2000 As Reported: Revenues $ 4,297.6 $ 3,951.0 9 % Operating income $ 1,234.9 $ 1,073.5 15 % EBITDA $ 1,682.0 $ 1,373.3 22 % Pro Forma: Revenues $ 4,282.4 $ 4,111.3 4 % Operating income $ 1,325.3 $ 1,050.6 26 % EBITDA $ 1,759.6 $ 1,475.2 19 % The Cable Networks segment is comprised of MTV Networks ("MTVN"), including MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite, TV Land, TNN: The National Network and CMT; and BET: Black Entertainment Television, both are basic cable television program services; and Showtime Networks Inc. ("SNI"), owner of several premium subscription television program services. For the year, Cable Networks revenue, operating income and EBITDA growth as reported and on a pro forma basis was principally driven by revenue growth in cable and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") affiliate fees and increased efficiencies. MTVN experienced a decrease in advertising revenues for the year due to continued softness in the advertising market which contributed to a decline in the number of advertising spots sold at MTV, VH1 and TV Land. Effective cost containment measures at the channels, as well as a reduction of investment in online services during 2001 contributed to the operating income and EBITDA growth. Despite the challenging economic environment, BET delivered higher advertising sales due to increased pricing, and higher affiliate fee revenue. Showtime subscriptions increased 10% over the prior year by approximately 2.9 million to 31.3 million subscriptions at December 31, 2001. Capital expenditures for Cable Networks were $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $158.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. During the fourth quarter of 2001, MTVN recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $66.6 million principally reflecting severance from a reduction of workforce and lease termination costs. In conjunction with the restructuring, $8.8 million was recorded as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. The Company completed its acquisition of BET on January 23, 2001 for approximately $3 billion consisting principally of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption of debt. Pro forma results for all periods presented assume the acquisitions of TNN, CMT and BET had occurred on January 1, 2000 and are also adjusted to exclude the impact of the charge and transactions with divested investments. II 8 Television (CBS and UPN Television Networks and Stations; Television Production and Syndication) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2001 2000 As Reported: Revenues $ 7,247.7 $ 5,426.4 34 % Operating income $ 402.1 $ 351.0 15 % EBITDA $ 1,188.5 $ 919.1 29 % Pro Forma: Revenues $ 7,239.9 $ 7,093.7 2 % Operating income $ 459.5 $ 473.5 (3 )% EBITDA $ 1,244.0 $ 1,225.7 1 % The Television segment is comprised of the CBS and UPN Television Networks and stations, television production and syndication. For the year, Televisions results were led by the CBS Network and Paramount Television. CBS Networks pro forma revenue and EBITDA growth was principally driven by double digit advertising revenue growth in primetime due to increased pricing. During the 2000/2001 season, SUPER BOWL XXXV on the CBS Network was the top rated broadcast among households and viewers. SURVIVOR: THE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK was the number one ranked series of the season and CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION was the No.1 new series of the season, also among households and viewers. With the success of these, and other highly rated programs, including EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and THE DISTRICT, the CBS Network was the most watched and highest rated network among viewers and households. CBS Enterprises pro forma revenue decreased for the year principally due to lower participation fees received from THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW and absence of revenues from cancelled shows, including THE ROSEANNE SHOW and MARTIN SHORT, partially offset by the domestic syndication of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. Paramount Television benefited from network revenues for the new series ENTERPRISE, higher revenues from continuing network and first run syndication shows including FRASIER, JAG, JUDGE JUDY, JUDGE JOE BROWN and ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT and the licensing to basic cable of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and CHEERS. These higher revenues were partially offset by the absence of revenues from the cancelled series BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and SUNSET BEACH, and lower revenues from SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH and MOESHA whose prior year revenues included first time syndication availabilities. UPN benefited from ratings improvements and higher advertising revenues in 2001. The pro forma revenue and EBITDA growth at the CBS Network and in syndication was partially offset by lower advertising sales for television stations due to continuing weakness in the advertising market and the impact of the events of September 11. CBS Network also recorded higher news production costs to cover the war in Afghanistan and contractual rights fee increases for sports properties. Capital expenditures for Television were $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $116.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Pro forma results assume that the Viacom/CBS Merger and the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest of UPN had occurred January 1, 2000. In November 2001, the Company completed the television station swaps of WDCA TV Washington D.C. and KTXH TV Houston in exchange for KBHK TV San Francisco and pro forma results reflect the impact of the swaps as if they had occurred on January 1, 2000. Pro forma results are adjusted to exclude approximately $48 million of Viacom/CBS merger related charges. Additionally, they exclude a charge associated with the integration of UPN with CBS operations II 9 of $53.4 million of which $52.8 million was restructuring and $.6 million was depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. Pro forma results are also adjusted to exclude transactions with divested investments and operating losses before depreciation for iWon.com of approximately $98 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. In 2001, iWon.com is accounted for as a deconsolidated investment, whereas in 2000, iWon.com was a minority owned, consolidated subsidiary. License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2001, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $460.1 million. Infinity (Radio Stations and Outdoor Advertising Properties) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2001 2000 As Reported: Revenues $ 3,670.2 $ 2,764.7 33 % Operating income $ 291.8 $ 589.4 (50 )% EBITDA $ 1,517.7 $ 1,282.6 18 % Pro Forma: Revenues $ 3,668.2 $ 3,967.5 (8 )% Operating income $ 264.1 $ 479.2 (45 )% EBITDA $ 1,516.2 $ 1,737.2 (13 )% The Infinity segment is comprised of owned and operated radio stations and outdoor advertising properties. For the year, Infinitys pro forma revenues, operating income and EBITDA decreases are the result of lower revenues in both the radio and outdoor advertising businesses due to the continuing softness in the advertising market including lower demand from the technology sector. Infinity Radios decrease in pro forma revenues was primarily driven by lower advertising rates, given the difficult advertising market. Infinitys outdoor transit business was affected by lower pricing, particularly in the New York market, which suffered more than other markets after the events of September 11. Capital expenditures for the Infinity segment were $99.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $72.0 million for the period ended December 31, 2000, reflecting expenditures from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger. On February 21, 2001, the Company completed its merger with Infinity acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock that it did not already own, or approximately 36%, for a total purchase price of approximately $13.4 billion. Reported operating income for 2001 reflects incremental amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of this minority interest. Pro forma results assume the acquisition of a majority interest in Infinity as part of the Viacom/CBS Merger and the subsequent acquisition of the minority interest of Infinity had occurred on January 1, 2000 and also assume the completion of acquisitions and divestitures of radio and outdoor properties by Infinity had occurred at the beginning of each period presented. Pro forma results are also adjusted to exclude transactions with divested investments. II 10  Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; as well as the operation of Movie Theaters, Theme Parks and Music Publishing) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2001 2000 As Reported and Pro Forma: Revenues $ 2,950.2 $ 2,758.3 7 % Operating income $ 158.2 $ 209.7 (25 )% EBITDA $ 316.7 $ 368.8 (14 )% The Entertainment segment is comprised of Paramount Features, movie theaters, music publishing, and Paramount Parks. For the year, Entertainments revenues increased principally due to higher Features and theaters revenues. Features revenue increases were led by higher home video revenues partially offset by lower foreign theatrical film revenues. Home video revenues included domestic contributions from the release of THE GODFATHER DVD COLLECTION, LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER, WHAT WOMEN WANT and RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE, along with contributions from the foreign video release of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2. Paramounts domestic theatrical revenues included contributions from VANILLA SKY, JIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS, LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER, SAVE THE LAST DANCE, THE SCORE and ALONG CAME A SPIDER. Theater revenues were higher primarily as a result of higher attendance and increased admission prices and per capita concession spending. Parks revenues were higher than the prior year principally due to increased admission prices and per capita concession spending. For the year, Entertainments EBITDA and operating income decreased 14% and 25%, respectively, principally reflecting the revenue items noted above, which were more than offset by increased print and advertising costs associated with a higher number of pictures in theatrical release during 2001. Capital expenditures for Entertainment were $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $87.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. License fees for television exhibition of completed motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2001, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $1.0 billion. Video (Home Videocassette, DVD and video game rental and retail operations) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2001 2000 As Reported: Revenues $ 5,156.7 $ 4,960.1 4 % Operating income $ (219.6 ) $ 75.7 NM EBITDA $ 204.1 $ 534.8 (62 )% Pro Forma: Revenues $ 5,156.7 $ 4,960.1 4 % Operating income $ 175.1 $ 107.3 63 % EBITDA $ 596.2 $ 534.8 11 % NM not meaningful II 11 The Video segment is comprised of Blockbusters operations, primarily in the rental of home videocassettes, DVDs and video games. For the year, Video revenues increased 4% driven by higher worldwide same store sales and an increase in the number of company operated stores of 158. Worldwide same store sales, including rental and retail product, increased 2.5% driven by strong international growth and continued growth in DVDs. On a pro forma basis, Blockbusters gross profit margins were 59.6% in 2001 versus 59.0% in 2000. The improvement in profit margins was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of rental revenues and previously viewed product sales from DVDs which on average have a lower cost than VHS rental product and a higher average unit selling price for previously viewed product sales. If Blockbuster increases its purchases of DVDs under revenue sharing arrangements, Blockbusters DVD rental revenues and gross profit should increase, while rental gross margins as a percentage of revenue could decline. Pro forma operating income and EBITDA increases were primarily driven by increased gross profit. This growth was partially offset by increases in compensation and occupancy costs principally driven by store growth and increased customer service initiatives. Capital expenditures for Blockbuster were $93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $212.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Blockbuster ended the year with 7,981 company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 304 stores over the prior year. Viacom currently owns approximately 81% of Blockbuster (NYSE: BBI). Pro forma results for 2001 are adjusted to exclude the previously reported Blockbuster charges of $395 million, principally related to the elimination of less productive VHS tapes as part of the transition from VHS to the higher margin DVD rental market and a change in amortization. Publishing (Consumer Publishing) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2001 2000 As Reported and Pro Forma: Revenues $ 648.7 $ 596.0 9 % Operating income $ 40.8 $ 49.6 (18 )% EBITDA $ 65.1 $ 71.3 (9 )% The Publishing segment is comprised of the Simon & Schuster operating unit, which publishes and distributes a wide range of hardcover, trade paper, paperback, audio and childrens novelty titles under various imprints including Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner, Pimsleur, MTV Books, Star Trek Books, Aladdin and The Free Press. For the year, Publishings revenue increases were driven by each of its major operating units; Adult, Childrens and New Media. The business finished the year with one of its strongest ever publishing and sales performances. During the year, Simon & Schuster had a record 98 New York Times best sellers, published 2 National Book Award winners: "THE NOONDAY DEMON" by Andrew Solomon, and "TRUE BELIEVER" by Virginia Euwer Wolff, and won Caldecott Honors for 2 major childrens titles. Publishings best selling titles included "SELF MATTERS" by Phillip C. McGraw, "ON THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE" by Mary Higgins Clark, "DREAMCATCHER" by Stephen King and "JOHN ADAMS" by David McCullough. Revenue increases in 2001 were more than offset by start up investment costs associated with transitioning information and technology support to a new third party provider and higher operating expenses. Capital expenditures for Publishing were $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company operates its publishing business under the Entertainment segment and will present its publishing business as part of such segment. II 12 Other Income and Expense Information 2001 versus 2000 Corporate Expenses/Eliminations Corporate expenses/eliminations, excluding depreciation expense, for 2001 reflect corporate expenses of approximately $148.0 million and intersegment profit eliminations of $191.7 million. Corporate expenses of $148.0 million decreased 82% from $824.9 million in 2000 primarily due to the $650 million of Viacom/CBS merger related charges being recorded in 2000 and effective cost containment measures achieved in 2001. Intersegment profit eliminations are principally comprised of television programming sales to cable networks and the sale of feature films to cable and broadcast networks and the Video segment. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2001, depreciation and amortization expense increased to $3.1 billion as compared with $2.2 billion for 2000. This increase is primarily due to the full year of amortization of goodwill associated with the Viacom/CBS Merger as well as, the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Infinitys minority interest and the acquisition of BET. The aggregate goodwill of approximately $60.6 billion associated with these transactions is being amortized on a straight line basis over its useful life which does not exceed 40 years. Accounting for intangible assets and the recognition of amortization expense will change upon the Companys adoption of the new standard for goodwill and other intangible assets in 2002 (see Recent Pronouncements). Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $962.7 million for 2001 from $822.3 million for 2000. The increase principally reflects the full year impact of $3.7 billion of CBS debt assumed as of the Viacom/CBS Merger as well as the Companys fixed rate debt issuances of $1.65 billion in January 2001, $1.4 billion in May 2001 and $335 million in June 2001. This was offset by lower interest rates on the Companys variable rate debt, debt maturities, redemptions and tenders and the termination of a credit facility that occurred during 2001. The Company had approximately $11.1 billion and $12.7 billion principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities) at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 6.8% and 7.6%, respectively. Interest Income Interest income decreased 42% to $30.6 million for 2001 from $53.2 million for 2000 due to lower cash balances and the general decrease in interest rates. Other Items, Net In 2001, "Other Items, net" of $254.7 million principally reflects a gain from television station swaps of $210.1 million and the recovery of certain advertising commitments of $250.0 million offset by impairment losses related to the Companys investments of approximately $125.0 million. These one time pre tax gains were partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $8.2 million and loss from the sale of assets of $22.8 million. Additionally, 2001 reflects an impairment loss of $46.6 million related to the purchase of two television stations. In 2000, "Other items, net" of $8.8 million principally reflected foreign exchange gains of $31.7 million and net gains of approximately $44.3 million on the sale of assets which were mostly offset by the write down of approximately $66.9 million of several internet cost investments to their market value. II 13 Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. The annual effective tax rates of 107.5% for 2001, excluding one time gains of $288.4 million and one time pre tax charges of $525.4 million, and 73.4% for 2000 excluding the 2000 merger related charges of $698 million, were adversely affected by amortization of intangibles in excess of the amounts deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the non deductible amortization of intangibles, the annual effective tax rates would have been 39.3% for 2001 and 38.8% for 2000. Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $127.0 million for 2001 as compared to $124.2 million for 2000. The 2001 equity loss principally reflects operating losses from international ventures and internet investments partially offset by positive results from Comedy Central. The prior year includes losses from CBS online equity ventures that were subsequently written down as well as equity losses of UPN, partially offset by results from Comedy Central. The remaining 50% interest of UPN was acquired by the Company in March 2000 and its results have been consolidated with the Company since the date of acquisition. Minority Interest, net of tax Minority interest for 2001 primarily represents the minority ownership of Infinity, prior to its merger with the Company on February 21, 2001, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster common stock. Minority interest for 2000 principally reflects the minority ownership of Infinity, from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster common stock. Extraordinary Loss, Net of Tax In 2001, the Company recognized an extraordinary loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $3.9 million, net of tax benefits of $2.6 million. The extraordinary loss is not significant and therefore did not impact basic and diluted earnings per share. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded an after tax non cash charge of $452.3 million, or $.37 per basic and diluted share, which resulted from the early adoption of the new accounting standard for motion pictures. Net Earnings (Loss) For the reasons described above, the Company reported a net loss of $223.5 million for 2001 as compared with net loss of $816.1 million for 2000. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2000 VERSUS 1999 On a reported basis, revenues increased 56% to $20.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $12.9 billion for 1999. Total expenses increased 61% to $18.7 billion for 2000 from $11.6 billion for 1999. Operating income and EBITDA increased 6% to $1.3 billion and 69% to $3.5 billion for 2000, respectively, from $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion for 1999, respectively. The increases in results of operations are principally attributable to the Viacom/CBS Merger, partially offset by merger related charges. Cable Networks segment revenue increases were driven by advertising sales growth. Increased same store revenues and the increase in the number of Company operated stores drove Video segment revenue growth. II 14  Segment Results of Operations 2000 versus 1999 The Companys segment results have been reclassified to conform to the 2001 segment presentation. No pro forma discussion is presented for the 2000 versus 1999 yearly results. Cable Networks (Basic Cable and Premium Subscription Television Program Services) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2000 1999 As Reported: Revenues $ 3,951.0 $ 3,075.3 28 % Operating income $ 1,073.5 $ 867.9 24 % EBITDA $ 1,373.3 $ 1,004.7 37 % For the year, MTVN revenues of $2.9 billion, operating income of $1.1 billion and EBITDA of $1.3 billion increased 29%, 33% and 42%, respectively. The increase in MTVNs revenues reflects 28% higher worldwide advertising revenues principally driven by rate increases at MTV, VH1 and TV Land and higher affiliate fees. MTVNs operating income and EBITDA gains were driven by the increased revenues partially offset by increased programming and production expenses, principally at MTV and VH1. For the year, SNIs revenues, operating income and EBITDA increased 10%, 24% and 21%, respectively, as compared with the prior year. The revenue increases were principally due to an increase of approximately 5.2 million subscriptions, up 22% over the prior year to 28.4 million subscriptions at December 31, 2000. Operating results reflect revenue increases attributable to the continued growth of direct broadcast satellite subscriptions partially offset by higher programming expenses and increased marketing for the promotion of original series. Television (CBS and UPN Television Networks and Stations; Television Production and Syndication) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2000 1999 As Reported: Revenues $ 5,426.4 $ 2,352.0 131 % Operating income $ 351.0 $ 143.4 145 % EBITDA $ 919.1 $ 271.5 239 % For the year, Television segment revenues, operating income and EBITDA growth were principally due to the Viacom/CBS Merger, reflecting results of operations of the CBS Network, CBS Television Stations and CBS Enterprises beginning May 2000. Strong performances were delivered at the CBS Network, television stations and at UPN. CBS Networks revenues and EBITDA growth during 2000 were primarily due to increases in both upfront and scatter advertising pricing. Television stations results benefited from strong advertising pricing in local owned and operated television markets. Approximately 80% of CBS Networks inventory for the 2000 2001 television season was sold in the upfront market and all day parts achieved double digit price increases. The success of the CBS Network was led by its new reality based television shows, including SURVIVOR, the finale of which was second only to the SUPER BOWL as the most watched television event in 2000. SURVIVOR also favorably impacted the ratings and revenue generated by other day parts, including News and Late Night. CBS Networks Monday night comedies, led by EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, also posted significant growth. CBS Networks strong revenue growth was partially offset by higher programming costs and election year coverage expenses. CBS Network had the top two new dramas in the 1999/2000 season with CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION and THE DISTRICT. CBS Enterprises, which includes King World Productions, reported higher revenues and EBITDA primarily due to increased domestic license fees from THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW and HOLLYWOOD SQUARES, partially offset by lower revenues from THE ROSEANNE SHOW. II 15 Paramount Television revenues for the full year 2000 were higher for continuing network and first run syndication shows including ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT, JUDGE JUDY, CHARMED, 7TH HEAVEN and JUDGE JOE BROWN. Syndication revenues included the first time syndication availability of SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH and MOESHA, and distribution fees from the initial syndication of SPIN CITY; however, these contributions did not compare favorably with the prior year which included the last seasons of BEVERLY HILLS 90210, MELROSE PLACE, SUNSET BEACH, STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE, and SISTER, SISTER and the first time syndication availability of JAG, STAR TREK: VOYAGER, VIPER and THE SENTINEL and higher library syndication revenues. Paramount Televisions EBITDA also improved led by FRASIER and JUDGE JUDY combined with significant overhead savings resulting from the integration of Spelling Entertainment into Paramount Television. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 also benefited from the recognition of a cable retransmission royalty settlement. In the second quarter of 2000, the Company elected early adoption of the AICPAs Statement of Position "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films" ("SOP 00 2") which is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2000. SOP 00 2 established new film accounting standards, including changes in revenue recognition and accounting for advertising, development and overhead costs. As a result of the early adoption, Television recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $330 million, primarily related to Spelling Entertainment. This charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting and is not included in operating income and EBITDA above. The Television segments operating results for 2000 were reduced by approximately $9 million due to this accounting change. License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2000, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $622 million. Infinity (Radio Stations and Outdoor Advertising Properties) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2000 1999 As Reported: Revenues $ 2,764.7 NM Operating income $ 589.4 NM EBITDA $ 1,282.6 NM NM not meaningful The 2000 revenues, operating income and EBITDA for the Infinity segment, reflect the acquisition of a majority interest in Infinity, as part of the Viacom/CBS Merger, effective May 4, 2000. Infinitys results benefited from strong advertising revenues at both Infinitys radio stations and outdoor advertising businesses. Advertising revenue during 2000 was primarily driven by higher advertising rates, reflecting increased demand for advertising at the majority of the radio stations and in the outdoor advertising business. II 16 Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; as well as the operation of Movie Theaters, Theme Parks and Music Publishing) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2000 1999 As Reported: Revenues $ 2,758.3 $ 2,665.9 3 % Operating income $ 209.7 $ 231.1 (9 )% EBITDA $ 368.8 $ 378.3 (3 )% For the year, Entertainment revenues increased 3% to $2.8 billion compared with the prior year, principally reflecting higher Features and theaters revenues. Higher Features revenues were driven by increased worldwide theatrical and home video revenues as compared with 1999. Domestic theatrical revenues for 2000 included the strong performance of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, WHAT WOMEN WANT, SHAFT, RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE, RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, SNOW DAY and THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY. Foreign theatrical revenues for 2000 were higher primarily due to the success of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, SHAFT, DOUBLE JEOPARDY and SLEEPY HOLLOW. Home video revenues were higher and included contributions from MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, DOUBLE JEOPARDY, RUNAWAY BRIDE, SLEEPY HOLLOW and RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. Theater revenues were higher primarily as a result of additional new multiplex theaters opened since the end of 1999 and increased per capita spending. Parks revenues were comparable with the prior year. Entertainment revenues for the prior year also included the recognition of a pay television license for library products and the renewal of a film processing agreement. For the year, Entertainments operating income and EBITDA decreased 9% and 3%, respectively, primarily due to lower Theater profits as a result of higher operating costs and costs associated with opening additional multiplexes in 2000. Parks operating income and EBITDA for 2000 were higher than the prior year due to lower operating costs. As a result of the Companys adoption of SOP 00 2 in the second quarter of 2000, Paramount Pictures recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $423 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting which was not included in operating income and EBITDA above. For 2000, Entertainments operating results were reduced by approximately $20 million due to this accounting change. License fees for television exhibition of completed motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2000, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $1.0 billion. Video (Home Videocassette, DVD and video game rental and retail operations) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2000 1999 As Reported: Revenues $ 4,960.1 $ 4,463.5 11 % Operating income $ 75.7 $ 127.9 (41 )% EBITDA $ 534.8 $ 520.3 3 % For the year, Video revenues increased 11% driven by an increase in same store revenues and the increase in the number of company operated stores. Worldwide same store revenues increased 5.6% for the year ended December 31, 2000 and worldwide rental revenues increased 5.9%. For the year, international same store revenues increased 11.6% and domestic same store revenues increased 4.3% over 1999. Blockbuster ended the year with 7,677 company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 524 stores over the prior year. II 17 Operating results for 2000 were impacted by Blockbusters investment in its online operations, which began operations in the fourth quarter of 1999 and resulted in reductions to operating income and EBITDA of $96.8 million and $53.4 million, respectively. Excluding the amounts attributable to its online operations, Videos operating income and EBITDA increased 28% and 12%, respectively, as compared with the prior year. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2000, Blockbuster determined that the carrying value of certain hardware and capitalized software components primarily related to the e commerce portion of its Internet site were impaired, and as a result, recorded a charge of approximately $31.6 million as part of depreciation expense. For the year, Videos gross margin decreased to 59.0% from 60.5% principally due to an increase in the percentage of total revenues generated through revenue sharing arrangements, as revenue sharing arrangements on average have lower gross margins than traditional buying arrangements. Publishing (Consumer Publishing) Year Ended December 31, Percent Better/(Worse) 2000 1999 As Reported: Revenues $ 596.0 $ 610.7 (2 )% Operating income $ 49.6 $ 54.3 (9 )% EBITDA $ 71.3 $ 74.0 (4 )% For the year, Publishing experienced lower net sales at the Pocket Books and Trade divisions primarily due to lower frontlist sales which drove operating income and EBITDA declines partially offset by increased license fees and lower product costs. In 2000, Trade divisions best selling titles included "BEFORE I SAY GOOD BYE" by Mary Higgins Clark, "ON WRITING" by Stephen King and "SEAT OF THE SOUL" by Gary Zukav and the Childrens division best selling titles included "OLIVIA" by Ian Falconer. Other Income and Expense Information 2000 versus 1999 Corporate Expenses/Eliminations Corporate expenses/eliminations, excluding depreciation, for 2000 reflect corporate expenses of approximately $824.8 million and intersegment profit eliminations of $103.2 million. Corporate expenses of $824.8 million increased from $174.1 million in 1999 primarily due to the $650 million of merger related charges being recorded in 2000. Intersegment profit eliminations principally reflect the profit eliminations of the sale of feature films to Cable Networks and Video Segment, and television programming sales to Cable Networks. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2000, depreciation and amortization increased to $2.2 billion as compared with $844.7 million for 1999. This increase was primarily due to the Viacom/CBS Merger, which resulted in additional expense of approximately $1.0 billion. Interest Expense Interest expense increased to $822.3 million for 2000 from $448.9 million for 1999. This increase is primarily due to the assumption of $3.7 billion of debt resulting from the Viacom/CBS Merger. The Company had approximately $12.7 billion and $6.0 billion principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities) at December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively. Interest Income Interest income increased 92% to $53.2 million for 2000 from $27.7 million for 1999 due to higher amounts of marketable securities and slightly higher rates of return from investments. II 18  Other Items, Net In 2000, "Other items, net" of $8.8 million principally reflects foreign exchange gains of $31.7 million and net gains on the sale of assets of approximately $44.3 million which were mostly offset by the write down of several internet cost investments to their current market value resulting in a loss of approximately $66.9 million. In 1999, "Other items, net" of $17.8 million reflects a $25.2 million foreign exchange gain partially offset by a net loss of approximately $7.4 million from the sale of assets. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. The annual effective tax rates of 73.4% for 2000, excluding the 2000 Viacom/CBS merger related charges of $698 million, and 48.8% for 1999 were adversely affected by amortization of intangibles in excess of the amounts deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the non deductible amortization of intangibles, the annual effective tax rates would have been 38.8% for 2000 and 35.4% for 1999. Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $124.2 million for 2000 as compared to $60.7 million for 1999, principally reflecting increased losses of internet equity ventures and losses in equity theater ventures partially offset by the improved results from Comedy Central. Minority Interest, net of tax Minority interest in 2000 primarily represented the minority ownership of Infinity and Blockbuster common stock. In February 2001, the Company acquired the remaining minority interest of Infinity that it did not own. Extraordinary Loss, Net of Tax In 1999, the Company recognized after tax extraordinary losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $37.7 million, or a loss of $.06 per basic and diluted share. Net Earnings (Loss) For the reasons described above, the Company reported a net loss of $816.1 million for 2000 as compared with net earnings of $334.0 million for 1999. Acquisitions, Merger Related and Other Charges The Viacom/CBS Merger was effective May 4, 2000. The total purchase price of approximately $39.8 billion included approximately $37.7 billion for the issuance of 825.5 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and 11,004 shares of Viacom Series C convertible preferred stock, which were subsequently converted into 11.0 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock, and approximately $1.9 billion for the fair value of CBS stock options assumed by the Company and transaction costs. In addition, Viacom assumed approximately $3.7 billion of CBS debt. After divestitures and television station swaps following the Viacom/CBS Merger, the television stations currently held by the Company have an aggregate national audience reach for purposes of the national ownership cap of approximately 39%. In connection with the Viacom/CBS Merger, the FCC ordered the Company to come into compliance with the national television ownership cap by May 4, 2001. However, the Company challenged the national ownership limit in federal court and the FCC mandated divestiture was stayed pending an order of the court. On February 19, 2002, the court found the FCCs 1998 decision not to repeal or modify the national ownership cap to be arbitrary and capricious and remanded the rule to the FCC for further consideration whether to repeal or modify the rule. On March 28, 2002, the FCC ordered that the Company has until 12 months after the issuance of a final FCC II 19 decision on the remand to file any application that may be necessary to come into compliance with any limits that may exist at that time. In the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded non recurring merger related charges of $698 million ($505 million after tax or $.41 per share), associated with the integration of Viacom and CBS and the acquisition of UPN (see Note 3). These amounts included non cash charges of $415 million principally attributable to compensation for stock options and $283 million of cash payments and accrued liabilities for severance, transaction fees and integration costs. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had paid and charged approximately $109 million for severance liabilities, $27 million for transaction fees and $69 million related to integration costs. Other Acquisitions In November 2001, the Company completed the television station swaps of WDCA TV Washington D.C. and KTXH TV Houston in exchange for KBHK TV San Francisco. As a result of the swaps, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $210.1 million. On February 21, 2001, the Company completed a merger with Infinity, acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock that it did not already own, approximately 36%. Under the terms of the merger, which was tax free for the stockholders of Infinity and Viacom, each issued and outstanding share of Infinity Class A common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.592 of a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock. The total purchase price of approximately $13.4 billion represented the issuance of approximately 231.6 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the fair value of Infinity stock options assumed by the Company. On January 23, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of BET for approximately $3 billion, which principally represents the net issuance of approximately 43.0 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption by the Company of approximately $590 million in debt. On September 15, 2000, Infinity completed the acquisition of Memphis radio stations WMC AM and WMC FM for approximately $76 million. On August 24, 2000, Infinity completed the acquisition of 18 radio stations from Clear Channel for approximately $1.4 billion in an asset transaction. These stations are located in San Diego, Phoenix, Denver, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Orlando and Greensboro Winston Salem. On July 1, 2000, Infinity completed the acquisition of Waterman Broadcasting Corporation of Texas in exchange for approximately 2.7 million shares of Infinity Class A common stock valued at approximately $88 million. Waterman Broadcasting owns radio stations KTSA AM and KTFM FM in San Antonio, Texas. During the second quarter of 2000, Infinity completed the acquisition of Giraudy, one of Frances largest outdoor advertising companies, for approximately $400 million. Infinity also acquired Societa Manifesti & Affisioni S.p.A., one of the leading Italian outdoor media sales companies, for approximately $90 million. On March 31, 2000, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in UPN that it did not already own. In the second quarter of 2000, the Company consolidated UPNs results of operations. Prior to this acquisition, the Company reported its proportionate share of net losses of UPN in "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Blockbuster Special Item Charges During the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster executed a strategic re merchandising plan to allow for an expansion of store space for DVD and other strategic product offerings. Blockbuster initiated this plan with the goal of optimizing its stores revenues and gross profit based on an evaluation of its product mix and product offerings. This evaluation also included analyses of industry trends and projections, such as the accelerated consumer acceptance of the DVD format, as evidenced by Blockbusters increase in DVD II 20 rental revenues as a percentage of total rental revenues from approximately 7.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2000 to approximately 19.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2001 and the continued increase to 23.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2001. In connection with its plan, Blockbuster eliminated approximately 30% of its rental VHS library in its stores, certain VHS merchandise inventory primarily located in its distribution center, and certain games from its rental library in its stores, and reorganized several of its corporate departments. The cost of the eliminated inventory, net of any estimated proceeds, resulted in primarily non cash charges of approximately $195.9 million to operating expenses in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Blockbuster also recorded a charge of approximately $26.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to employee, labor and supply and disposal costs to execute the plan. Additionally, $2.6 million was charged to depreciation expense and $1.9 million was charged below operating income to equity in loss of affiliated companies. This strategic re merchandising plan was completed by the end of 2001 through the destruction or sale of the identified items. Also, during the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster recorded approximately $27.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to two outstanding lawsuits. The amounts described above, along with the $141.7 million recorded as a change in accounting estimates for rental inventory, comprise the Blockbuster charges of $394.7 million to operating income for the year ended December 31, 2001. Change in Accounting Estimates For Rental Inventory Effective July 1, 2001, Blockbuster changed its accounting estimates related to rental inventory, including residual values and useful lives, in connection with its strategic re merchandising plan discussed above. The residual value of VHS rental inventories was reduced from $4 per unit to $2 per unit, and the residual value of game rental inventories was reduced from $10 per unit to $5 per unit. In addition, Blockbuster reduced its estimate of the useful life of its base stock VHS rental inventories from 36 months to 9 months. These changes in estimate reflect the impact of changes in the rental business, such as an increase in DVD rental revenues, a decrease in VHS rental revenues and trends affecting games, which have led to a reduction in the average selling value of Blockbusters previously rented VHS and game products and a reduction in the average life of VHS rental products. As a result of these changes in estimate, the Companys operating expenses were $141.7 million higher and net loss was higher by $73.9 million, or an increase in loss per share of $.04, than it would have been under the previous method for the year ended December 31, 2001. Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of 2001, MTVN announced a restructuring plan to reduce headcount in its domestic offices and close certain offices in Latin America, Europe and Asia. In connection with this plan, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $66.6 million. Included in the restructuring charge was severance of $58.3 million for the termination of approximately 450 employees worldwide and lease termination and other occupancy costs of $8.3 million for vacated office space in New York. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had paid and charged $11.4 million against the severance liability and the lease termination liability has not yet been utilized. The Company expects to substantially utilize these reserves by the end of 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with the Companys plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $52.8 million. The restructuring charge included programming write offs of $29.6 million, approximately $15 million of employee related costs, including severance, and lease termination and other costs of $8.2 million. The integration of UPN with CBS Network operations began in January 2002. The Company plans to eliminate approximately 50 positions and vacate space at 3 of UPNs offices. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had not II 21 utilized the severance and lease termination reserves. The Company plans to substantially utilize these reserves by the end of 2002. In June 1999, the Company completed its tender offer for all outstanding shares of Spelling Entertainment Group Inc. ("Spelling") common stock that it did not already own for $9.75 per share in cash and then acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Spelling not tendered through a merger of Spelling and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the merger, each share of Spelling common stock was also converted into the right to receive $9.75 in cash. The consideration for tendered shares was approximately $176 million. In connection with the integration of the operations of Spelling into Paramount Television, the Company recorded a charge of approximately $81.1 million, of which $70.3 million was recorded as a restructuring charge and $10.8 million was recorded as part of depreciation expense in the third quarter of 1999. Included in the charge were severance and employee related costs of $48.1 million, lease termination and other occupancy costs of $17.7 million and other exit costs of $4.5 million. Severance and other employee related costs represent the costs to terminate approximately 250 employees engaged in legal, sales, marketing, finance, information systems, technical support and human resources for Spelling. Lease termination and other occupancy costs principally represent the expenses associated with vacating existing lease obligations in New York and Los Angeles. The depreciation expense of approximately $10.8 million was associated with the fixed asset write offs for software, leasehold improvements and equipment located at these premises. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had paid and charged approximately $48.1 million against the severance liability, $13.9 million against lease termination and other occupancy costs, and $3.1 million against the other exit costs. Financial Position Current assets decreased to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2001 from $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2000 principally due to reductions in cash and receivables. The decrease in cash principally represents the timing of payments of commercial paper obligations. The decrease in accounts receivable was principally due to the sale of receivables under the receivable securitization programs. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 7.1% at December 31, 2001 compared to 5.8% at December 31, 2000. Property and equipment decreased to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2001 from $6.6 billion at December 31, 2000 principally reflecting depreciation expense of $872.8 million partially offset by acquired assets and capital expenditures of $515.4 million principally for cable networks, television and radio equipment and new and existing video stores. Non current inventory increased to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2001 from $3.6 billion at December 31, 2000, principally reflecting an increase in theatrical inventory due to the timing of incurred production costs for in process inventory, the timing of home video releases and the availability of films to pay and free television markets, and increases in program rights. These increases were partially offset by the Blockbuster special item charges which reduced VHS rental inventory. Intangibles of $71.0 billion at December 31, 2001 increased by $9.0 billion compared to $62.0 billion at December 31, 2000, principally reflecting the merger with Infinity and the BET acquisition partially offset by amortization expense of $2.2 billion. Current liabilities decreased to $7.6 billion at December 31, 2001 from $7.8 billion at December 31, 2000 principally due to reductions in accounts payable and income taxes payable reflecting the timing of payments. The other liabilities balance of $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2001 principally consist of long term accrued distribution fees, accrued program rights, and retained liabilities of discontinued operations. The minority interest balance of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2001 decreased from $7.0 billion at December 31, 2000 reflecting the February 2001 merger with Infinity. II 22 Cash Flows Operating Activities. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for 2001 principally reflects a net loss of $223.5 million adjusted for $3.1 billion of depreciation and amortization expense and $512 million for the 2001 Blockbuster, MTVN, and UPN charges plus decreases in accounts receivable, partially offset by payments of accrued expenses and accounts payable. Net cash flow from operating activities of $2.3 billion in 2000 primarily reflects the net loss of $816.1 million adjusted for $2.2 billion of depreciation and amortization, $698.5 million of Viacom/CBS merger related charges and $753.9 million for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle partially offset by increases to receivables and payment of accrued liabilities. Investing Activities. Net cash expenditures for 2001 investing activities of $1.2 billion principally reflect the acquisitions of BET and outdoor businesses and capital expenditures of $515.4 million partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of radio stations and other assets. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $2.9 billion for 2000 principally reflect capital expenditures of $659.0 million and acquisitions of $2.4 billion principally for radio stations and outdoor businesses. Financing Activities. Financing activities for 2001 principally reflect $1.6 billion net repayment of debt and $1.1 billion used to repurchase Company stock. Financing activities for 2000 principally reflect approximately $3.1 billion of borrowings from banks and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and debentures partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock. Planned capital expenditures, including information systems costs, are approximately $625 million to $675 million in 2002. These expenditures are primarily related to capital additions for cable networks, television and radio equipment, new and existing video stores and theme park attractions. The Companys joint ventures are expected to require estimated net cash contributions of approximately $10 million to $20 million in 2002 as compared to net cash contributions of $15 million in 2001. Cash paid for income taxes of $430 million for 2001 were favorably impacted by the one time utilization of certain tax attributes primarily related to pre merger related activities of CBS, the recognition of tax benefits associated with non recurring items and the deferral of the obligation to make 2001 federal estimated tax payments until 2002 as a result of the events of September 11. In addition to the deferral of tax payments related to September 11, cash income taxes for 2002 will be higher due to expected higher operating income and the absence of the 2001 non recurring items and are expected to be in the range of approximately $900 million to $1.1 billion. Subsequent to its August 1999 initial public offering, Blockbuster no longer participates in the Companys centralized cash management system. Cash generated by Blockbusters operations is expected to be retained by Blockbuster to fund its anticipated cash requirements. On July 7, 1999, the Viacom Five Year Warrants expired. The Company received proceeds of approximately $317 million and issued approximately 9.0 million shares of its Class B Common Stock in connection with the exercise of 4.5 million warrants issued as part of the 1994 acquisition of Paramount Communications. II 23  Share Repurchase Programs During 2001, the Company repurchased 24.2 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.0 billion under its share repurchase programs. Fourth quarter 2001 repurchases included in this total amounted to $254 million. From January 1 through March 8, 2002, the Company had repurchased 6.6 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for $271 million and as of March 8, 2002 there was approximately $753 million remaining under the authorized repurchase program. During 2000, the Company repurchased 10,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock and 34.2 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.95 billion in the aggregate. During 1999, the Company had repurchased 25,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock, 10.6 million shares of its Class B Common Stock and 1.1 million Viacom Five Year Warrants, for approximately $466.4 million in the aggregate. Capital Structure The following table sets forth the Companys long term debt: At December 31, 2001 2000 Notes payable to banks $ 645.0 $ 1,879.1 Commercial paper 1,104.3 3,856.4 Senior debt 8,834.6 5,594.9 Senior subordinated debt 50.8 732.2 Subordinated debt 19.8 39.4 Other notes 16.2 43.5 Obligations under capital leases 452.0 552.2 11,122.7 12,697.7 Less current portion 299.0 223.9 $ 10,823.7 $ 12,473.8 The Company has classified short term indebtedness as long term debt based upon its intent and ability to refinance such indebtedness on a long term basis. Debt, including the current portion, as a percentage of total capitalization of the Company decreased to 15% at December 31, 2001 from 21% at December 31, 2000. As a result of the Viacom/CBS Merger, Viacom assumed approximately $3.7 billion of CBS debt. On March 28, 2000, the Viacom credit agreements were amended to allow for the merger of CBS with and into the Company. On April 17, 2000, the CBS credit agreement, which consisted of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing August 29, 2001 and the Infinity credit agreement, which consisted of a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing August 29, 2001, were amended to allow for the merger of CBS with and into the Company. On May 3, 2000, Infinity entered into two new credit facilities, totaling $1.95 billion, comprised of a $1.45 billion 5 year revolving credit facility and a $500 million 364 day revolving credit facility. On March 7, 2001, the Company cancelled all of the above mentioned credit agreements other than the Infinity $1.45 billion facility, and entered into two new credit facilities. These two new facilities totaled $3.5 billion and were comprised of a $1.5 billion 5 year revolving credit facility and a $2.0 billion 364 day revolving credit facility. The Company also amended and restated the Infinity $1.45 billion facility. The terms and conditions were substantially conformed to the $1.5 billion 5 year revolving credit facility and the Company was designated as the borrower. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had unused revolving credit facilities of $4.85 billion in the aggregate. The $2.0 billion facility was to expire in 2002, and the $1.5 billion and $1.45 billion facilities in 2005 and 2006, respectively. On March 5, 2002, the Company II 24 entered into a new $1.8 billion 364 day facility to replace the $2.0 billion facility which was to expire on March 6, 2002. The $1.8 billion facility expires in March 2003. The primary purpose of the facilities is to support commercial paper borrowings. The Company, at its option, may borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the $1.5 billion 5 year revolving credit facility. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Companys senior unsecured debt rating. At December 31, 2001, LIBOR for borrowing periods of one month and two months were 1.87% and 1.88%, respectively. The Company pays commitment fees based on the total amount of the facility commitments. As of March 5, 2002, the amounts available under the Companys revolving credit facilities totaled $4.59 billion. The facilities contain certain covenants which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants. The Company expects to be in compliance and satisfy all such covenants as may be applicable from time to time during 2002. The Company issues commercial paper under its $4.75 billion program. Borrowings under the program have maturities of less than a year and are supported by unused revolving credit facilities. At December 31, 2001, the Company had borrowings under the program of approximately $1.1 billion. On January 15, 2002, the 11.375% subordinated debentures due 2009 were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 105.7% of the principal amount. On December 3, 2001, the Company completed a consent solicitation and tender offer to purchase for cash substantially all of the outstanding 8.875% senior subordinated notes due 2007 at a redemption price equal to 107.5% of the principal amount. An extraordinary loss of $3.9 million, net of tax, was recognized on the tender offer. On June 29, 2001, the Company issued $335 million of 7.25% senior notes due June 30, 2051; interest on the senior notes will be paid quarterly. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay commercial paper indebtedness. The senior notes are redeemable at anytime by the Company after June 30, 2006 at their principal amount plus accrued interest. In 2001, the Company issued, under Rule 144A, $800 million of 6.40% senior notes due January 30, 2006, $1.0 billion of 6.625% senior notes due May 15, 2011; $500 million of 7.70% senior notes due July 30, 2010, and $750 million of 7.875% senior debentures due July 30, 2030; interest on the senior notes and debentures will be payable semi annually. Proceeds were used to repay bank debt, including commercial paper. These notes and debentures were exchanged for registered notes and debentures. The senior debentures and the senior notes due July 30, 2010, May 15, 2011 and July 30, 2030 are redeemable at any time at their principal amount plus the applicable premium and accrued interest. During 2001, all $189.6 million outstanding of Infinitys 9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2006 were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 104.7% of the principal amount. On February 1, 2001, all $60.3 million outstanding of Infinitys 9% senior subordinated notes due 2006 were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 104.5% of the principal amount. On August 1, 2000, the Company issued $1.15 billion of 7.70% senior notes due July 30, 2010 and $500 million of 7.875% senior debentures due July 30, 2030; interest on the senior notes and debentures is payable semi annually. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay bank debt, including commercial paper. The senior notes and debentures are redeemable at any time at their principal amount plus the applicable premium and accrued interest. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had an aggregate of $950 million outstanding under revolving receivable securitization programs. The programs result in the sale of receivables on a non recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable and debt on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The Company enters into these arrangements because they provide a cost efficient form of financing and an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from the II 25 programs were used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The Company is required to maintain certain ratios in connection with these programs. As of December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization programs. Blockbuster Credit Agreement On June 21, 1999, Blockbuster entered into a $1.9 billion unsecured credit agreement (the "Blockbuster Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of banks. The Blockbuster Credit Agreement was initially comprised of a $700 million long term revolver due July 1, 2004; a $600 million term loan due in quarterly installments beginning April 1, 2002 and ending July 1, 2004; and a $600 million short term revolver, which was paid down during 2000. The repayment of the short term revolver permanently reduced the borrowing capacity under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement from $1.9 billion to $1.3 billion. Blockbuster had $700 million of available borrowing capacity under the long term revolver at December 31, 2001 and has the ability with this available borrowing capacity to extend the maturities of the current portion of their term loan. Blockbuster is actively reviewing its financing arrangements and will pursue strategies to optimize its capital structure. Interest rates under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement are based on the prime rate in the United States or LIBOR (plus a margin, or "LIBOR spread" based on leverage ratios, which is currently 1.25%), at Blockbusters option at the time of borrowing. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2001 for borrowings under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement was 5.8%. A variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver (.25% at December 31, 2001). The Blockbuster Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment of dividends, repurchase of Blockbusters common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2001, Blockbuster was in compliance with all covenants under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions, and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activity available to meet these needs. Any net cash funding requirements are financed with short term borrowings (primarily commercial paper) and long term debt. Commercial paper borrowings, which also accommodate day to day changes in funding requirements, are backed by committed bank facilities that may be utilized in the event that commercial paper borrowings are not available. The Companys strong credit position, which is reflected by an A /A3 rating, affords access to the capital markets. The Company anticipates that scheduled debt maturities of $582.6 million in 2002 and $910.0 million in 2003 will be funded with cash flows generated from operating activities which totaled $3.5 billion in 2001 and proceeds from the issuance of debt. The Company continually evaluates the relative cost of short and long term debt in conjunction with refinancing risk. There are no provisions in any of the Companys material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in the Companys debt ratings. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock and warrants of Viacom that may be issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 billion. The registration statement was first declared effective on January 8, 2001. The net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by Viacom for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital and capital expenditures; or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. To date, the Company has issued $335 million of securities under the shelf registration statement. II 26 Commitments and Contingencies The following table presents the Companys significant unrecorded contractual commitments and scheduled long term debt maturities (excluding commercial paper) as of December 31, 2001: 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 & thereafter Commitments $ 2,907.3 $ 2,380.3 $ 2,023.9 $ 1,782.2 $ 232.2 $ 5,913.4 Operating leases 833.5 753.9 633.4 517.0 415.3 1,861.2 Long term debt 582.6 910.0 178.9 1,472.8 800.8 5,571.9 Capital lease obligations (including interest) 172.6 112.2 76.5 62.5 49.8 88.8 Guaranteed minimum franchise payments 341.3 301.5 271.4 223.9 130.5 237.3 Letters of credit and surety bonds 305.8 Theater lease and long term debt guarantees 232.5 9.1 9.2 9.3 8.6 115.4 Commitments The Company has long term noncancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. The Company has also entered into capital leases for satellite transponders and buildings. Infinitys outdoor advertising business has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on such media as buses, taxis, trains, bus shelters, terminals, billboards, and phone kiosks. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchiser is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. Other commitments of the Company, estimated to aggregate approximately $15.2 billion, are not reflected in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2001. These commitments include approximately $10.3 billion for the acquisition of sports programming rights, approximately $3.9 billion relating to television and feature film production and acquisitions and approximately $1.0 billion for talent contracts. A majority of such fees are payable over several years, as part of the normal course of business. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Companys future minimum lease commitments and franchise payments. Guarantees The Company owns a 50% equity interest in United Cinemas International ("UCI") which operates movie theaters in Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Company guarantees approximately $367.2 million of UCIs debt obligations and theater leases. The Company also owns a 50% interest in WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. and Graumans Theatres LLC and guarantees certain theater leases for approximately $16.9 million. These guarantees are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2001. The Company is also subject to certain off balance sheet lease guarantees related to the divestitures of certain businesses. The Company estimates those guarantees to be less than $100 million at December 31, 2001. Legal Matters Antitrust. The Company, Blockbuster and Paramount Home Entertainment are among the defendants in a lawsuit filed on July 21, 1999 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas by one former and three present independent video retailers against the major motion picture studios and the Company. The plaintiffs, purporting to act as class representatives on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, alleged that the Company and the studios conspired among themselves II 27 and with Blockbuster to restrain competition in the nationwide market for distribution of videocassettes for rental to the public in violation of federal and California law. Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief under federal law as well as triple the amount of the alleged actual damages to themselves and those similarly situated under California statutes. In January 2001, plaintiffs moved to withdraw their California state law claims from the federal lawsuit in Texas and filed a substantially similar complaint with approximately 200 additional named plaintiffs in Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. This complaint also sought certification of a nationwide class of similarly situated plaintiffs. In March 2001, the Texas court denied the plaintiffs motion for class certification of both the federal and the California state law claims in the federal action and denied the plaintiffs motion to withdraw their California state law claims from that action. On January 8, 2002, the California court also denied plaintiffs motion for class certification. The Company believes that the plaintiffs position in these litigations is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously in the litigations. Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various asbestos related personal injuries, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had pending approximately 106,000 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 100,000 as of December 31, 2000 and 121,000 as of December 31, 1999. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2001, approximately 75,000 were pending in state courts, 22,000 in federal court and approximately 9,000 were third party claims. During 2001, the Company received approximately 60,000 new claims and closed approximately the same number of claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs in 2001 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits, were approximately $21 million. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer which is allegedly caused solely by exposure to asbestos, lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure, other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease. Only a very small percentage of the Companys pending asbestos claims that identify the alleged injury contain allegations that the plaintiffs exposure to asbestos resulted in cancer; in recent filings in which the Company knows the nature of the claimed injury, the percentage of cancer claims has been declining significantly. In more than 50% of the claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. II 28 Other. The Company has amounts owed by an international licensee under a series of long term licensing arrangements covering feature film and television product. The licensee is disputing its obligation to accept and to pay for a portion of this product under certain of these arrangements. The Company has brought suit to enforce its rights under those arrangements and strongly believes in the merits of its position. In the event of the licensees bankruptcy, the Company may be unable to recover some or all of amounts being sought in the litigation, as well as the undisputed sums owing under these arrangements. The Company however, believes that the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above described legal matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Market Risk Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. SFAS 133 also established new accounting rules for hedging instruments which, depending on the nature of the hedge, require that changes in the fair value of the derivatives either be offset against the change in fair value of assets or liabilities through earnings, or be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The impact of adoption was immaterial on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. The foreign exchange hedging instruments used are spot, forward and option contracts. The foreign exchange contracts have principally been used to hedge the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Euro. The Company designates forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company enters into non designated forward contracts to hedge non dollar denominated cash flows and foreign currency balances. The change in fair value of the non designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of "Other items, net." The Companys interest expense is exposed to movements in short term rates. Swap agreements are used to modify this exposure. This includes both fixed to variable rates swaps which are designated as fair value hedges and variable to fixed rate swaps which are designated as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2001, the swaps could be terminated by a payment of approximately $4.5 million. The effective portion of the change in fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During the next twelve months, approximately $6.4 million will be amortized into earnings. The ineffective portion included in earnings was not material. The change in value of the fair value hedges and the hedged instruments is reported in earnings for the periods presented. During December 2001, the Company entered into $750 million notional amount swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. Of the $750 million notional amount, $225 million matures on January 15, 2003, $275 million matures on September 1, 2003 and $250 million matures on June 1, 2005, and the Company receives interest at approximately 3.2%, 3.8% and 4.5%, respectively, and pays three month LIBOR. These fair value hedges were fully effective. On January 23, 2001, the Company, in connection with the acquisition of BET, assumed $425 million of cash flow swap agreements which effectively convert variable rate interest payments on commercial paper to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2001, the notional amount outstanding was approximately $253 million. The notional amount of the swaps amortize by approximately $78 million and $156 million in II 29 September of 2002 and 2003, respectively, and mature in September 2004. Interest is received based upon three month LIBOR and is paid at approximately 5.07%. At December 31, 2001, the notional amount of the foreign exchange derivative contracts was $268.1 million. Of this balance, $76.6 million represents cash flow hedges used to reduce foreign exchange exposure for future production costs. The remaining $191.5 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. The variable rate portion of the Companys debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding on December 31, 2001, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause a $22.4 million change in annual interest expense. The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. Outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds totaled approximately $306 million at December 31, 2001. The Companys receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2001, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Companys products and services are sold. Euro Conversion The Euro transition has been completed and the Companys transition to the Euro currency has not had a significant impact on the manner in which it conducts its business affairs and processes its business and accounting records. Accordingly, conversion to the Euro has not had a material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. Related Parties National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") is a closely held corporation that beneficially owns approximately 68% of the Companys Class A Common Stock and approximately 11% of the Companys Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis at December 31, 2001. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Company owns a minority equity interest in Westwood One, Inc. ("Westwood One"). Most of Infinitys radio stations are affiliated with Westwood One, and Westwood One distributes nationally certain of the Companys radio programming. In connection with these arrangements, the Company receives affiliation fees as well as programming cost reimbursements and in certain instances shares in revenue from the sale of Infinitys programming. In addition, certain employees of Infinity serve as officers of Westwood One for which the Company receives a management fee. Revenue and expense reimbursements from these arrangements were approximately $102.4 million and $77.6 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Recent Pronouncements In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and replaces SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of." SFAS 144 establishes an accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 30 for the disposal of segments of a business. Long lived assets classified as held for disposal as a result of disposal activities that were initiated prior to adoption of SFAS 144 shall continue to be accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 121 or II 30 APB Opinion No. 30. The adoption of SFAS 144 will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), effective for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under SFAS 141, all business combinations are required to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. SFAS 142 supersedes APB Opinion No. 17 "Intangible Assets", related to financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, including such assets recorded in past business combinations, no longer be amortized to earnings, but should instead be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. Intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment. The Company will adopt SFAS 142 in the first quarter of 2002. The Company has determined that with the exception of Blockbuster, none of the Companys reporting units has an impairment. The impairment charge will be determined after the fair value of Blockbuster has been allocated to specific assets and liabilities and will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Any potential write off of Blockbusters goodwill would represent an insignificant decrease relative to the Companys consolidated intangibles of approximately $71 billion. Also, as a result of the new accounting standard, future amortization expense will be significantly lower. The Company anticipates a significant reduction in amortization expense from $2.2 billion for 2001 to approximately $110 million for 2002. Critical Accounting Policies The SEC recently issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of a financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates. Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with SOP 00 2 which requires managements judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or license period. These judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized programming costs associated with revenues earned and any net realizable value adjustments. The cost of Blockbusters rental library, which includes videocassettes, DVDs and games, is amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 12 months to an estimated residual value of $2 to $5 per unit, according to the product category. The estimates for useful lives and residual values of the rental library are continually evaluated based on changes in consumer demand. Changes in demand or buying patterns may impact the carrying value of the rental library and rental margins. During II 31 2001, Blockbuster changed the estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for videocassettes and game products, which resulted in inventory write downs and increased amortization expense. See Notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. The Company assesses potential impairment of long lived assets and identifiable intangibles under the guidance of SFAS 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." The Company will adopt SFAS 142 in the first quarter of 2002 and has determined that based on segment valuation studies with the exception of Blockbuster, none of the Companys reporting units has an impairment. The impairment charge will be determined after the fair value of Blockbuster has been allocated to specific assets and liabilities and will be recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Any potential write off of Blockbusters goodwill would represent an insignificant decrease relative to the Companys consolidated intangibles of approximately $71 billion. The Companys cost and equity investments, where market value has declined below cost, are regularly reviewed by management to determine whether or not there has been an other than temporary decline in market value. In making that determination, management considers the extent to which cost exceeds market value, the duration of the market decline and the investees earnings and cash forecasts, and current cash position, among other factors. In 2001, the Company recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately $125.0 million. Balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to taxes, legal issues, restructuring charges and discontinued operations, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments and estimates by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued businesses, including environmental and asbestos are adequate, there can be no assurance that these factors will not change in future periods. Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements This document and the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10 K, including "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition", contain both historical and forward looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect the Companys current expectations concerning future results and events. These forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will" or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe the Companys objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. II 32  The following important factors, among others, could affect future results, causing these results to differ materially from those expressed in the Companys forward looking statements: The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising time on its over the air networks, basic cable networks, television stations, radio stations and outdoor businesses. The advertising market has recently experienced softness. The sale of advertising time is affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising time. Adverse changes to any of these factors could have a negative effect on revenues. Operating results derived from the Companys motion picture and television production fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public, which are difficult to predict. Motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent and other factors have resulted in higher production costs. In addition, the commercial success of the Companys motion picture and television productions also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions, and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities. The Companys operating results also fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases, as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition. The Companys basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent on affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home ("DTH") distributors on acceptable terms. The loss of carriage on such distributors, or continued carriage on less favorable terms, could adversely affect, with respect to basic cable networks, revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising time, and with respect to premium subscription television networks, subscriber fee revenues. In addition, continued consolidation among cable and or DTH distributors could have an adverse effect on subscriber fee revenues. Some of the Companys businesses are seasonal. The home video and consumer publishing businesses are subject to increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays, while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is generated from May through September. In addition, the home video and theme parks businesses revenues are influenced by weather. The Companys radio and outdoor advertising business experiences fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers and typically experiences highest revenues in the fourth quarter and lowest revenues in the first quarter. The Companys home video retail business currently enjoys a competitive advantage over most other movie distribution channels, except theatrical releases, due to the early timing of the video retailer "distribution window." The Video business could be negatively affected if the video retail distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release; the length of the video retail distribution window was shortened; or the video retail distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now. The Company believes that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable video retail industry, however, the order, length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie. Studios have historically sold VHS movies to video retailers under a two tiered pricing structure consisting of "rental pricing" and "sell through" pricing, thereby creating a "rental window" for VHS product. The Company cannot control or predict with certainty studio pricing policies. The rental window has benefited the rental industry because, during the rental window, VHS prices are too high to generate consumer demand for purchasing VHS. There is not currently a domestic rental window for DVD. DVD rental product has generated higher margins than VHS revenue II 33 sharing product due to the lower cost associated with sell through DVD pricing, however, this pricing has also resulted in competition from mass merchant retailers at an earlier stage than is the case for VHS. The Video business could be negatively affected if consumers desire to purchase, rather than rent, movies. In addition, Videos profitability could be adversely affected if it did not derive most of its revenues from the rental business, as sell through margins are generally lower than rental margins. Changes in FCC laws and regulations could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the operations and ownership of the Companys properties. The Company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued operations, including environmental liabilities and pending litigation. While the pending or potential litigation, environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance in this regard. The Company may be adversely affected by changes in technology and its effect on competition in the Companys markets. Other economic, business, competitive and or regulatory factors affecting the Companys businesses generally. These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results. The forward looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document and the Company does not have any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. The Company cannot assure you that projected results or events will be achieved. You should review carefully all information, including the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements, included or incorporated by reference into this Form 10 K. Item 7A.
