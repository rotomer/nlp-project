The Company considers its properties adequate for its present needs. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had pending approximately 103,800 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 106,000 as of December 31, 2001 and approximately 100,000 as of December 31, 2000. The 2001 and 2000 numbers of claims included approximately 7,100 claims and 1,900 claims, respectively, on an inactive docket in Baltimore which would not be counted as pending under the Companys current methodology. In addition, the pending claim count was reduced by approximately 24,000 claims as a result of the Supreme Court of New Yorks order dated December 2002 establishing a deferred docket of claimants alleging minimal or no impairment. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2002, approximately 73,900 were pending in state courts, 27,100 in federal court and approximately 2,800 were third party claims. During 2002, the Company received approximately 49,400 new claims and closed approximately 18,500 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. I 38 Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs in 2002 and 2001 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $28 million and $21 million, respectively. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos, lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure, other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease. The total number of asbestos claims filed during 2002 has declined relative to 2001 primarily as a result of a decline in claims filed on behalf of individuals who have not identified the claimed injury or who are asymptomatic as to an alleged asbestos related disease. Claims identified as cancer remain a small percentage of asbestos claims pending at December 31, 2002. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities and that these asbestos liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort claims arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. Antitrust. In March 2001, after a series of judicial rulings, three individuals remained as plaintiffs in a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas against the Company, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment, and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries. They asserted, among other things, that the Company, Blockbuster and the studios conspired to fix the prices of videos to retailers and distributors, engaged in discriminatory pricing, and conspired to restrain competition. They were seeking treble damages for themselves and injunctive relief under both federal and California state law. In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the defendants. Plaintiffs have appealed the judgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2001, a similar complaint was filed in California in a Los Angeles County Superior Court by over 200 individual plaintiffs seeking class certification and monetary damages against the same defendants. In January 2002, the California court denied the plaintiffs request for class certification, and the plaintiffs have appealed that decision to a California appellate court. By order dated February 20, 2003, the California state court judge dismissed with prejudice all claims against the defendants. The Company believes that the plaintiffs position in these litigations is without merit and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in the litigations. Blockbuster Securities Actions. During February and March 2003, three putative class action complaints were filed against Blockbuster in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas claiming violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and seeking a class determination for purchasers of Blockbuster stock for the approximately eight month period between April and December 2002. Certain members of Blockbusters senior management are also named as defendants. A shareholder derivative action arising from the same operative facts was filed in February 2003 in the same court; and another shareholder derivative action was filed in March 2003 in the 160th Judicial District Court for Dallas County, Texas claiming breach of fiduciary duties for an approximately three week period from late April through mid May 2002. These actions named certain Blockbuster directors, some of whom are directors and or executive officers of the Company, and certain members of Blockbusters senior management, as individual defendants, and Blockbuster as a nominal defendant. Responses have not yet I 39 been filed to any of these lawsuits. The Company believes the plaintiffs positions in these lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend these matters. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that all of the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

II 2  Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Overview Viacom Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries ("Viacom" or the "Company") is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations, during 2002, in the following segments: CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of MTV Networks ("MTVN") including MTV MUSIC TELEVISION, NICKELODEON/NICK AT NITE, VH1 MUSIC FIRST, MTV2 MUSIC TELEVISION, TV LAND, NOGGIN, TNN: THE NATIONAL NETWORK, CMT: COUNTRY MUSIC TELEVISION; SHOWTIME NETWORKS INC.

TELEVISION: The Television segment consists of the CBS and UPN television networks, the Companys owned broadcast television stations, and its television production and syndication business, including KING WORLD PRODUCTIONS, and PARAMOUNT TELEVISION. Television generates revenues primarily from advertising sales and television license fees. INFINITY: The Infinity segment owns and operates 185 radio stations through INFINITY RADIO and owns and or operates outdoor advertising properties through VIACOM OUTDOOR. Infinity revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales. Beginning January 1, 2003, the Company operates Infinity as two segments, RADIO and OUTDOOR.

II 3 The following table presents the contributions to consolidated revenues from each segment for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Percentage Contribution of Revenues by Segment Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cable Networks 19 % 19 % 20 % Television 30 31 27 Infinity 15 16 14 Entertainment 15 15 17 Video 23 22 25 Eliminations (2 ) (3 ) (3 ) Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The Companys consolidated revenues were $24.6 billion, $23.2 billion and $20.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company generated approximately 16%, 16% and 18% of its total revenues from international regions in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, approximately 56% and 23% of international revenues of $4.0 billion were generated in Europe and Canada, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, approximately 54% and 23% of total international revenues of $3.8 billion were generated in Europe and Canada, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2000, approximately 54% and 23% of total international revenues of $3.6 billion were generated in Europe and Canada, respectively. The tables below present the Companys consolidated revenues by type and the percentage and amount of contribution of each type of revenue to consolidated revenues, net of intercompany eliminations, for each of the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Revenues by Type Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Advertising sales $ 11,225.4 $ 10,723.2 $ 8,143.6 Rental/retail sales 5,480.1 5,049.9 4,866.5 Affiliate fees 2,199.0 2,030.9 1,694.1 TV license fees 1,506.9 1,385.4 1,558.6 Features film exploitation 1,827.3 1,824.6 1,675.6 Other(a) 2,367.0 2,208.8 2,105.3 Total $ 24,605.7 $ 23,222.8 $ 20,043.7 Percentage of Revenues by Type Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Advertising sales 46 % 46 % 41 % Rental/retail sales 22 22 24 Affiliate fees 9 9 8 TV license fees 6 6 8 Feature film exploitation 7 8 8 Other(a) 10 9 11 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (a) Other primarily includes revenues from publishing, theme park operations, movie theaters, home video and royalties and fees. II 4 Consolidated Results of Operations 2002 vs. 2001 and 2001 vs. 2000 Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2002, revenues of $24.6 billion increased 6% from 2001 primarily driven by increases in advertising revenues, with additional contributions from increases in rental/retail sales, television license fees and affiliate fees. For the year ended December 31, 2001, revenues increased 16% to $23.2 billion from 2000. Revenue increases resulted from higher advertising sales, rental/retail sales, feature film revenues and affiliate fees partially offset by a decrease in television license fees. 2000 results reflect only eight months of CBS operations effective from May 4, 2000 when CBS Corporation merged with and into the Company, (the "Viacom/CBS Merger"). Advertising sales increased 5% in 2002 led by increases of 12% in the Cable Networks segment, 4% in the Television segment and 2% in the Infinity segment. The aggregate increase in advertising revenue was driven primarily by increased units sold at cable networks, as well as increases in average unit rates and units sold at the broadcast network operations. The Company benefited from the recovery and strength of the advertising market in 2002, especially during the second half of the year. Early indications in 2003 suggest continuing improvement in the advertising market; however advertising sales are dependent upon various factors, including continued strong ratings, and the strength of the overall economy and the advertising market. In particular, world events, including war or terrorism, could have an adverse effect on the advertising market. Advertising sales growth in 2001 versus 2000 was driven by the Viacom/CBS Merger. Advertising revenues accounted for 46% of the Companys consolidated revenues for 2002 and 2001 and 41% for 2000. Rental/retail sales for 2002 were up 9% in the video segment with rental sales growth of 3% and retail sales growth of 39%. Both rental and retail growth were driven by an increase in the number of company operated stores of 495 and by the continuing strength of DVD and game products. DVD rental revenues represented 39% of total rental revenues in 2002 compared with 19% in 2001, and 7% in 2000. Rental/retail sales for 2001 increased 4% from 2000 with a 4% increase in both rental revenue and retail revenue driven by an increase in the number of company operated stores of 158. DVD retail revenues more than doubled in 2002 from 2001 as a result of increased consumer demand. Retail revenues increased to 19% of total rental/retail revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 15% in 2001 and 14% in 2000. The Company expects rental and retail DVD revenues to increase as a percentage of revenues in 2003 compared with 2002. Affiliate fees for 2002 increased 8% over 2001 driven by increases at MTVN, SNI and BET reflecting rate increases at each of the networks as well as an increase in subscriber volume at MTVNs digital channels. Affiliate fees for 2001 increased 20% over 2000 driven by increases at MTVN and SNI, and the acquisition of BET in January 2001. Growth in 2001 versus 2000 at MTVN was principally due to the acquisition of TNN and CMT as part of the Viacom/CBS Merger as well as increases in both rate per subscriber and subscriber volume; growth at SNI reflected increases in both cable and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") fees. Television license fee revenues increased 9% in 2002 primarily from increased syndication revenues from cable sales and additional syndication revenues from the launch of THE DR. PHIL SHOW in 2002. Television license fees decreased 11% in 2001 compared with 2000 due to lower distribution fees and the absence of revenues from canceled shows. Feature film revenues remained flat in 2002 versus 2001, and increased 9% in 2001 versus 2000 primarily from strong home video growth partially offset by lower theatrical revenues. II 5 Operating Expenses Operating expenses include the following major components: production expenses attributable to television programming and feature films which reflect the amortization of television and theatrical inventory costs including direct production costs, residuals and participation expenses, production overhead and acquisition costs, as well as costs attributable to radio programming expenses including on air talent and other production costs; program amortization expenses reflecting the amortization of costs incurred to acquire rights to programming exhibited on the broadcast networks, cable networks and broadcast stations; costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses including amortization of the costs of videocassette, DVD and game inventory, revenue sharing expenses on rental inventory, store employee compensation expenses and occupancy expenses; and distribution expenses reflecting advertising and other distribution costs including residuals and participation expenses, incurred primarily with respect to theatrical and television product. For the year ended December 31, 2002, operating expenses of $14.9 billion increased 3% over operating expenses for 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2001, operating expenses of $14.5 billion increased 24% over operating expenses for 2000. The changes in operating expenses were due to the following: Production and program amortization expenses for 2002 increased 4% versus 2001 driven by contractual increases in costs associated with series at the broadcast networks and increases at the Company owned television stations due to new entertainment and sports programming investments. Production and program amortization expenses for 2001 increased 26% versus 2000 primarily reflecting a full year of expenses for CBS Network and stations, as well as radio stations, versus eight months in 2000 effective from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger. The increase in 2001 was also driven by higher news production costs at the broadcast networks, increased expenses associated with higher syndication revenues, the change in mix of network series in 2001 compared with 2000, higher contractual rights fees associated with SUPER BOWL XXXV and increases for other sports properties at CBS Network. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2002 increased 1% versus 2001 reflecting a shift in product mix and the net increase in the number of company operated stores of 495, partially offset by the 2001 charge associated with Blockbusters re merchandising and store reconfiguration plans. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2001 increased 14% versus 2000 reflecting the increase in the number of company operated stores of 158 and the 2001 charge described above. Distribution expenses for 2002 increased 8% versus 2001 reflecting higher costs associated with prints and advertising due to the higher number of feature films partially offset by a decrease in other distribution costs. Distribution expenses for 2001 increased 13% versus 2000 reflecting higher print and advertising costs associated with a higher number of feature films in theatrical release during 2001. Other operating expenses for 2002 include outdoor advertising expenses, which increased 10% versus 2001 reflecting higher guarantee payments for transit contracts. Other operating expenses for outdoor increased significantly in 2001 versus 2000 as 2001 reflected twelve months of expenses for outdoor compared with eight months in 2000 and also reflected expenses for acquired outdoor properties. II 6 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, which include expenses incurred to provide back office support, occupancy, selling and marketing costs, and incentive compensation, increased 3% to $4.2 billion for 2002 from $4.1 billion in 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses of $4.1 billion remained unchanged with the prior year reflecting costs savings across several divisions offset by an increase associated with a full year of expenses in 2001 from the Viacom/CBS Merger. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus 18% for 2001 and 20% for 2000. Included within selling, general and administrative expenses are residual costs, which primarily include pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. Residual costs for 2002 versus 2001 decreased 22% to $67.8 million due primarily to the recognition of actuarial gains for benefit plans of certain divested businesses. Residual costs increased 13% in 2001 versus 2000 as 2001 reflected a full year of costs compared with eight months in 2000, from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger. In 2003, pension expense for the Companys pension plans, including plans associated with its divested businesses is expected to increase by approximately $100 million primarily due to decreases in pension plan asset values and the expected rate of return on such assets. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2002, depreciation and amortization decreased to $945.6 million as compared with $3.1 billion for 2001. The decrease was due to the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") effective January 1, 2002, and as a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. For the year ended December 31, 2001, depreciation and amortization expense increased to $3.1 billion as compared with $2.2 billion for 2000. This increase was primarily due to the full year of amortization of the goodwill attributable to the Viacom/CBS Merger versus eight months of this amortization in 2000, as well as the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the remaining interest in Infinity and the acquisition of BET in 2001. Total Expenses Total expenses, including depreciation and amortization, decreased 8% to $20.0 billion for 2002 versus $21.8 billion for 2001 principally reflecting a reduction in amortization expense associated with the adoption of SFAS 142 in 2002 and the charge recorded by Blockbuster in 2001. Total expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 16% to $21.8 billion for 2001 from $18.7 billion for 2000, reflecting increases associated with revenue growth and twelve months of expenses for the combined companies, including goodwill amortization, associated with the Viacom/CBS Merger versus eight months of expenses, including amortization, in 2000. Additionally, 2000 results reflected the Viacom/CBS Merger related charge of $698.5 million. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense decreased 12% to $848.3 million from $969.2 million for 2001 due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates partially offset by expenses recognized upon the early redemption of debt in 2001. The Company had approximately $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2001 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at weighted average interest rates of 6.6% and 6.8%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, interest expense increased to $969.2 million from $822.3 million for 2000. The increase principally reflected the full year impact of $3.7 billion of CBS debt assumed II 7 with the Viacom/CBS Merger as well as the Companys fixed rate debt issuances of $1.65 billion in January 2001, $1.4 billion in May 2001 and $335.0 million in June 2001. This was offset by lower interest rates on the Companys variable rate debt and as a result of debt maturities, redemptions and tenders. The Company had approximately $13.1 billion principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at December 31, 2000 at a weighted average interest rate of 7.6%. Interest Income For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest income decreased to $15.8 million from $30.6 million in 2001. Interest income in 2000 was $53.2 million. The decreases in interest income were due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in 2002 versus 2001, and in 2001 versus 2000. Other Items, Net For the year ended December 31, 2002, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $30.0 million which principally consisted of foreign exchange losses of $51.9 million, losses of $19.7 million associated with securitizing trade receivables and an aggregate loss of approximately $13.8 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value. These losses were partially offset by the recovery of advertising commitments of $29.8 million, a gain of $18.8 million on the sale of a telephone kiosk advertising business and a net gain of $5.5 million from the sale of investments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, "Other items, net" of $254.7 million principally reflected a gain from television station swaps of $210.1 million and the recovery of certain advertising commitments of $250.0 million offset by impairment losses of approximately $125.0 million related to the Companys investments. The one time pre tax gains were also partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $8.2 million and losses of $22.8 million associated with securitizing trade receivables. Additionally, 2001 reflects an impairment loss of $46.6 million related to the purchase of two television stations. The recovery of advertising commitments in 2002 and 2001 reflected the restructuring of agreements with several Internet companies. As a result, the Company was released from related advertising commitments and reversed related deferred revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2000, "Other items, net" of $8.8 million principally reflected foreign exchange gains of $31.7 million and net gains of approximately $44.3 million on the sale of assets which were principally offset by the write down of approximately $66.9 million of several Internet investments to their market value. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. For 2002, the annual effective tax rate was 38.8%, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting, versus 118.5% in 2001 and 130.2% in 2000. The annual 2001 and 2000 rates were adversely affected by non deductible goodwill amortization. Assuming SFAS 142 had been adopted, the annual effective tax rates would have been 36.8% for 2001 and 43.0% for 2000. Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $39.5 million for 2002, $127.0 million for 2001 and $124.2 million for 2000. The amounts principally reflected operating losses from international ventures and Internet investments partially offset by Comedy Centrals results. Additionally, 2001 reflected operating losses from Internet equity investments that were no longer operating in 2002. The 2000 amount included losses from online equity ventures as well as equity losses of UPN, partially offset by results from Comedy Central. The remaining 50% interest of UPN was acquired by the Company in March 2000, and its results have been consolidated with the Company since the date of acquisition. II 8 Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest for 2002 primarily reflected the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Minority interest for 2001 primarily represented the minority ownership of Infinity, prior to its merger with the Company on February 21, 2001, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Minority interest for 2000 principally reflected the minority ownership of Infinity, from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Extraordinary Loss, Net of Tax In 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 145 which required that gains or losses recognized upon the extinguishment of debt no longer be classified as extraordinary. The Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $3.9 million, net of tax benefit of $2.6 million, in 2001. This amount has been reclassified to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations to conform with this new accounting standard. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest and Tax Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142 and recorded an after tax non cash charge of $1.5 billion (net of minority interest of $336 million), or $.84 per basic and $.83 per diluted share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded an after tax non cash charge of $452.3 million, or $.37 per basic and diluted share, which resulted from the early adoption of SOP 00 2, "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films" ("SOP 00 2"). Net Earnings (Loss) The Company reported net earnings of $725.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with a net loss of $223.5 million for 2001. The substantial improvement in net earnings reflected revenue growth principally from advertising sales and the reduction of amortization expense resulting from the implementation of SFAS 142. These increases were partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge of $1.5 billion recorded in 2002 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax. The Company reported a net loss of $816.1 million for 2000. 2001 reflected a full year of results for the combined company as a result of the Viacom/CBS Merger compared with eight months of results for 2000. Additionally, 2000 included a pre tax merger related charge of $698.5 million and an after tax non cash charge of $452.3 million from the adoption of SOP 00 2. II 9 Segment Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 The tables below present the Companys revenues and operating income by segment, as reported for each of the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues: Cable Networks $ 4,726.7 $ 4,297.6 $ 3,951.0 10 % 9 % Television 7,490.0 7,247.7 5,426.4 3 34 Infinity 3,754.6 3,670.2 2,764.7 2 33 Entertainment 3,646.9 3,597.8 3,351.7 1 7 Video 5,565.9 5,156.7 4,960.1 8 4 Eliminations (578.4 ) (747.2 ) (410.2 ) 23 (82 ) Total Revenues $ 24,605.7 $ 23,222.8 $ 20,043.7 6 % 16 % Operating Income: Cable Networks(a) $ 1,772.2 $ 1,234.9 $ 1,073.5 44 % 15 % Television(b) 1,202.4 402.1 351.0 199 15 Infinity 1,225.6 291.8 589.4 NM (50 ) Entertainment 333.5 199.0 259.3 68 (23 ) Video(c) 355.8 (219.6 ) 75.7 NM NM Segment Operating Income 4,889.5 1,908.2 2,348.9 156 (19 ) Corporate expenses (159.0 ) (169.1 ) (847.3 ) 6 80 Eliminations(d) (66.0 ) (191.7 ) (103.2 ) 66 (86 ) Residual costs(e) (67.8 ) (87.2 ) (77.5 ) 22 (13 ) Total Operating Income $ 4,596.7 $ 1,460.2 $ 1,320.9 215 % 11 % NM Not meaningful (a)2001 year reflects a fourth quarter charge of $75.4 million principally related to a restructuring plan at MTVN to reduce headcount and close certain international offices. (b)2001 year reflects a fourth quarter charge of $53.4 million related to the Companys plan to integrate UPN with CBS Network operations. (c)2001 year reflects a primarily non cash charge of $394.7 million in Video principally related to the elimination of less productive VHS tapes as part of the transition from VHS to the higher margin DVD rental market and a change in amortization. (d)Eliminations principally reflect the profit elimination of the sale of feature films to cable and broadcast networks and to the Video segment, and television programming sales to cable networks. (e)Primarily includes pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. 2001 operating income was affected by one time, primarily non cash charges in the Companys Cable Networks, Television and Video segments. Additionally, in 2002, SFAS 142 was adopted resulting in the elimination of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. A comparison of reported 2002 operating income with reported prior years operating income is less meaningful as a result of these items. Management believes adjusting prior years to reflect the impact of SFAS 142 as if it had been adopted on January 1, 2000 and excluding these non recurring charges, provides a more meaningful comparison of operating income and is more useful in analyzing the underlying historical segment results and future trends. II 10  The table below presents a reconciliation of reported operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to operating income adjusted for SFAS 142 and excluding charges as described below: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Operating Income $ 4,596.7 $ 1,460.2 $ 1,320.9 SFAS 142 Adjustment 2,112.0 1,358.6 Charges: MTVN(a) 75.4 UPN(b) 53.4 Blockbuster(c) 394.7 Viacom/CBS Merger Related 698.5 Operating Income Adjusted for SFAS 142 and Excluding Charges $ 4,596.7 $ 4,095.7 $ 3,378.0 (a)Reflects restructuring charge of $66.6 million for severance as a result of a reduction in the workforce and lease termination costs and $8.8 million as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. (b)Reflects restructuring charge of $52.8 million in connection with the Companys plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations and $.6 million as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. (c)Reflects a primarily non cash charge in Video principally related to the elimination of less productive VHS tapes as part of the transition from VHS to the higher margin DVD rental market and a change in amortization. The table below presents the Companys operating income by segment as reported for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with 2001 and 2000 which are presented as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. Operating income for 2001 has also been adjusted to exclude the charges at MTVN, UPN and Blockbuster. Operating income for 2000 has been adjusted to exclude Viacom/CBS Merger related charges.

The Company believes that EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operating performance of its segments, and it is a primary measure used internally by management to manage the business. EBITDA is also a primary measure used externally by the Companys investors, analysts and peers in its industry. However, EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, net earnings, cash flows, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. As EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Please also see page II 10 of the Form 10 K where operating income is presented in accordance with GAAP.

("SNI"), owner of several Premium Subscription Television Program Services) (Contributed 19% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, and 20% for the year ended December 31, 2000). Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 4,726.7 $ 4,297.6 $ 3,951.0 10 % 9 % Operating income (OI) $ 1,772.2 $ 1,234.9 $ 1,073.5 44 % 15 % OI as a % of revenues 37% 29% 27% OI Adjusted(a) $ 1,772.2 $ 1,541.0 $ 1,196.5 15 % 29 % OI Adjusted as a % of revenues 37% 36% 30% EBITDA $ 1,963.1 $ 1,682.0 $ 1,373.3 17 % 22 % (a)2002 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has not been adjusted. 2001 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back (i) amortization expense of $230.7 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000, and (ii) the MTVN charge of $75.4 million related to its 2001 restructuring plan. 2000 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back amortization expense of $123.0 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% principally driven by 12% growth in advertising revenues and an 8% increase in affiliate fees. Approximately 9% of Cable Networks revenues were generated from international regions, with approximately 70% of this total from Europe. Advertising revenue increases reflected 11% growth at MTVN due to selling more units, partially offset by a reduction in average unit rates. MTVNs advertising revenue growth was adversely impacted by the airing of units to satisfy audience deficiency liabilities incurred at VH1. BET delivered 17% advertising revenue growth for 2002 over the prior year, benefiting from higher average rates, slightly offset by reduced paid programming revenues. BETs results for 2002 included three additional weeks versus 2001, due to the January 23, 2001 closing of the BET acquisition. Cable affiliate fees increased 8% principally due to mid single digit rate increases at MTVNs domestic channels, excluding digital, and an 18% increase in domestic subscribers principally due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Noggin and the expansion of MTVN digital channels. Also contributing to the increase in cable affiliate fees was a mid single digit increase in average rates for Showtime and The Movie Channel. Other ancillary revenues for Cable Networks were principally comprised of consumer products licensing revenues from Nickelodeon and represented approximately 8% of revenues for each year. For 2002, Cable Networks operating income increased 44% reflecting the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and the impact of the MTVN charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001. The MTVN charge reflected $66.6 million for severance due to a reduction in workforce and for lease termination costs. In conjunction with the restructuring, $8.8 million was recorded as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. Assuming operating income was adjusted for SFAS 142 and excluding the charge, operating income would have increased 15% in 2002 reflecting higher revenues partially offset by higher operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses, principally comprised of programming and production costs for the cable channels, increased 7%, driven by higher programming costs at MTV, Nickelodeon, TNN and SNI. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. Selling, general and II 13 administrative expenses excluding the restructuring charge, increased 10% primarily due to higher compensation expense from sales commissions as a result of revenue growth. Capital expenditures for Cable Networks were $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. 2001 vs. 2000 Cable Networks revenue and operating income growth was principally driven by revenue growth in cable and DBS affiliate fees and increased efficiencies in 2001. MTVNs advertising revenues decreased 4% due to softness in the advertising market which contributed to a decline in the number of advertising spots sold at MTV, VH1 and TV Land. Effective cost containment measures at the channels, as well as a reduction of investment in online services during 2001 contributed to the operating income growth. The acquisitions of BET in January 2001 and CMT and TNN in May 2000 as a result of the Viacom/CBS Merger contributed to the overall increase in advertising revenues of 6% and affiliate fee revenues of 20% for Cable Networks. Showtime subscriptions increased 10% over the prior year by approximately 2.9 million to 31.3 million subscriptions at December 31, 2001. Capital expenditures for Cable Networks were $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $158.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company completed its acquisition of BET on January 23, 2001 for approximately $3 billion consisting principally of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption of debt. Television (CBS and UPN Television Networks, Television Stations; Television Production and Syndication) (Contributed 30% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, 31% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 27% for the year ended December 31, 2000). Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 7,490.0 $ 7,247.7 $ 5,426.4 3 % 34 % Operating income (OI) $ 1,202.4 $ 402.1 $ 351.0 199 % 15 % OI as a % of revenues 16% 6% 6% OI Adjusted(a) $ 1,202.4 $ 1,100.4 $ 849.8 9 % 29 % OI Adjusted as a % of revenues 16% 15% 16% EBITDA $ 1,343.2 $ 1,188.5 $ 919.1 13 % 29 % NM Not meaningful (a)2002 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has not been adjusted. 2001 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back (i) amortization expense of $644.9 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000, and (ii) the UPN charge of $53.4 million related to the 2001 plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations. 2000 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back (i) amortization expense of $450.3 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000, and (ii) $48.5 million of the Viacom/CBS Merger related charge associated with the acquisition of UPN in 2000. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Television revenues increased 3% principally driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, partially offset by lower syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 2%, with 9% growth for both CBS and UPN in primetime due to 5% average rate increases, partially offset by rate decreases in daytime and news dayparts. CBS Network had additional units available for sale in 2002 versus the prior year when there were fewer units available as a result of the events of September 11 during which CBS ran sustaining news II 14 coverage from September 11 through September 14, 2001. CBS Network sold approximately 85% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2002 2003 season versus 65% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2001 2002 season. The revenue increases were partially offset by the absence of the Super Bowl, which CBS televised in 2001. The Stations group delivered 12% year over year advertising revenue growth led by increased political ads and higher sales in the automotive and services industries. The acquisition of KCAL TV Los Angeles in May 2002 contributed 5% of the Stations group revenue growth for the year. In 2003, protracted coverage of a prolonged war could have an adverse effect on Televisions revenues and expenses. For 2002, Television revenues also reflected a decrease in domestic and foreign syndication revenues and lower network revenues, partially offset by higher home video revenues. Domestic syndication revenues included revenues from the initial availability to cable of 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED, SISTER, SISTER, and ANY DAY NOW as well as higher library revenues from THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW and HAPPY DAYS. However, these revenues did not match the absence of contributions from the syndication of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and CHEERS in the prior year and license fees from cancelled series including STAR TREK: VOYAGER, DR. LAURA and REAL TV. Foreign syndication revenues were lower primarily resulting from lower current series revenues partially offset by higher revenues from library product. Network revenues decreased as revenues from new series in the 2002/2003 season were more than offset by the absence of revenues from canceled series. Home video revenues were higher primarily from the DVD release of seasons 1 through 7 of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. For 2002, Television operating income increased to $1.2 billion from $402.1 million reflecting the impacts of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations. Assuming operating income was adjusted for SFAS 142 and excluding the charge, operating income would have increased 9% in 2002 reflecting higher revenues partially offset by higher operating and general and administrative expenses. Production and programming expenses at the broadcast networks increased slightly by 1.5% for the year, principally reflecting higher costs in primetime due to contractual series increases and higher sports rights offset by lower NFL costs due to the absence of the Super Bowl in 2002. The Stations group incurred higher costs for syndicated programming and sports rights. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. Capital expenditures for Television were $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $380.9 million and $460.1 million, respectively. 2001 vs. 2000 For 2001, CBS and UPN Networks combined revenues and operating income growth of 63% and 99%, respectively, was principally driven by 71% higher advertising revenues, as comparisons with 2000 included only eight months of results from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger versus twelve months of results in 2001. Additionally, CBS Network advertising revenue increases were led by growth in primetime principally due to rate increases. UPNs higher advertising revenues in 2001 benefited from ratings improvements. Assuming the Viacom/CBS Merger occurred at the beginning of 2000, CBS Enterprises revenues decreased for the year principally due to lower distribution fees received from THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW and the absence of revenues from canceled shows, including THE ROSEANNE SHOW and MARTIN SHORT, partially offset by the domestic syndication of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. II 15 Television benefited from network revenues from the new series ENTERPRISE, higher revenues from continuing network and first run syndication shows including FRASIER, JAG, JUDGE JUDY, JUDGE JOE BROWN and ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT and the licensing to basic cable of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and CHEERS. These higher revenues were partially offset by the absence of revenues from the canceled series BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and SUNSET BEACH, and lower revenues from SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH and MOESHA whose prior year revenues included first time syndication availabilities. The revenue and operating income growth at the broadcast networks and in syndication was partially impacted by the events of September 11. CBS Network also recorded higher news production costs as well as contractual rights fee increases for sports properties. Capital expenditures for Television were $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $116.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Infinity (Radio Stations and Outdoor Advertising Properties) (Contributed 15% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, 16% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 14% for the year ended December 31, 2000).

Approximately 18% of Infinitys revenues were generated from international regions, with approximately 77% of this total from Europe. Radio revenues increased 5% due to an increase in spots sold for the year, with average spot rates increasing slightly. Radio revenues included consideration for management services provided to Westwood One radio network, an affiliated company. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. For 2002, Outdoor revenues decreased 1% due to weakness in the outdoor advertising market during the first half of 2002. Geopolitical events, including war or terrorism, could have an adverse effect on Infinitys advertising revenues. For 2002, Infinity operating income increased to $1.2 billion from $291.8 million reflecting the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Assuming operating income was adjusted for SFAS 142, operating income would have decreased 5% in 2002 reflecting incremental expenses associated with acquired sports rights and higher guarantee payments on outdoor transit contracts. Capital expenditures for Infinity were $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $99.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. II 16 2001 vs. 2000 For 2001, Infinity revenues increased 33%, with advertising revenues increasing 30%, as comparisons with 2000 included only eight months of results from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger versus twelve months of results in 2001. In 2001, approximately 18% of Infinitys revenues were generated from international regions, with approximately 75% of this total from Europe. Assuming the Viacom/CBS Merger occurred January 1, 2000, Infinity revenues would have decreased 5% with lower revenues in both the radio and outdoor advertising businesses due to the softness in the advertising market with lower demand from the technology sector. Infinitys outdoor transit business was affected by lower pricing, particularly in the New York market, which suffered more than other markets after the events of September 11. Operating income decreased reflecting the impact of twelve months of amortization of goodwill in 2001 associated with the Viacom/CBS Merger and the incremental amortization of goodwill from the acquisition of the remaining minority interest of Infinity. On February 21, 2001, the Company completed its merger with Infinity, acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock that it did not already own, or approximately 36%, for a total purchase price of approximately $13.4 billion. Capital expenditures for the Infinity segment were $99.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $72.0 million for the period ended December 31, 2000, reflecting expenditures from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger. Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; Consumer Publishing, as well as the operation of Theme Parks, Movie Theaters and Music Publishing) (Contributed 15% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 and 17% for the year ended December 31, 2000). Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 3,646.9 $ 3,597.8 $ 3,351.7 1 % 7 % Operating income (OI) $ 333.5 $ 199.0 $ 259.3 68 % (23) % OI as a % of revenues 9% 6% 8% OI Adjusted (a) $ 333.5 $ 263.3 $ 322.6 27 % (18) % OI Adjusted as a % of revenues 9% 7% 10% EBITDA $ 454.2 $ 381.8 $ 440.1 19 % (13) % (a)2002 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has not been adjusted. 2001 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back amortization expense of $64.3 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. 2000 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back amortization expense of $63.3 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Entertainment revenues increased 1% compared with the same prior year period principally reflecting higher Publishing, Theaters and Features revenues, which were partially offset by lower Parks revenues. Approximately 33% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were slightly higher mainly due to higher network television, domestic home video, domestic syndication and pay television revenues, which were partially offset by lower worldwide theatrical, foreign syndication, foreign pay television and foreign home video revenues. Domestic theatrical revenues primarily included contributions from the theatrical release of THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, WE WERE SOLDIERS, JACKASS THE MOVIE, CHANGING LANES and STAR TREK NEMESIS. Worldwide home video revenues were higher than last years revenues including contributions from VANILLA SKY, II 17 JIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS and WE WERE SOLDIERS. Worldwide home video revenues included increases from the growth in demand for current releases and library titles in the DVD format and an overall decline in the demand for the VHS format. Theaters revenues increased due to higher average admission prices, higher attendance and increased per capita concession spending. Attendance in 2002 increased 3% compared with the prior year. Average admission prices and per capita concession spending both increased 5% over the prior year. Publishing revenues increased 4% primarily due to income from new distribution agreements and higher sales in the Adult Group and Childrens Book and Audio Divisions. The Adult Groups top selling titles for 2002 included "FROM A BUICK 8" by Stephen King, "SELF MATTERS" by Phillip C. McGraw and "EVERYTHINGS EVENTUAL" also by Stephen King, while top selling titles in the Childrens Division included "AMERICA" by Lynne Cheney and Robert Sadubas "THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS". For 2002, Entertainments operating income increased 68% reflecting the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Assuming SFAS 142 had been adopted in 2001, operating income would have increased 27% in 2002 principally reflecting growth from Features and Theaters. Features benefited from lower development and overhead costs. Theaters results reflected higher revenues and lower depreciation expense. Capital expenditures for Entertainment were $74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $54.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. License fees for television exhibition of completed motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $948.1 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. 2001 vs. 2000 For 2001, Entertainments revenues increased 7% principally due to higher Features, Theaters and Publishing revenues. In 2001, approximately 34% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues increased 9% led by higher worldwide home video and Pay TV, as well as higher domestic theatrical revenues, partially offset by lower foreign theatrical revenues. Home video revenues in 2001 included domestic contributions from the release of THE GODFATHER DVD COLLECTION, LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER, WHAT WOMEN WANT and RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE, along with contributions from the foreign video release of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II. Domestic theatrical revenues in 2001 included contributions from LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER, SAVE THE LAST DANCE, WHAT WOMEN WANT, ALONG CAME A SPIDER, THE SCORE and VANILLA SKY. Theaters revenues increased 7% primarily as a result of higher attendance and increased admission prices and per capita concession spending. Attendance for the year increased 2% compared with 2000. Average admission prices increased 5.9% and average per capita concession spending increased 3.2% over the prior year. Publishing revenues increased 9% reflecting increases in each of its major operating units: Adult, Childrens, and New Media. The Adult Groups top selling titles in 2001 included "JOHN ADAMS" by David McCullough, "DREAMCATCHER" by Stephen King, "ON THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE" by Mary Higgins Clark and "SELF MATTERS" by Phillip C. McGraw. Top Childrens titles were "OLIVIA" and "OLIVIA SAVES THE CIRCUS" by Ian Falconer. For 2001, Entertainments operating income decreased 23% principally reflecting the revenue items noted above, which was more than offset by increased print and advertising costs associated with a higher number of pictures in theatrical release during 2001. Theaters operating income increased due to higher revenues and lower depreciation expense. Publishing revenues increase were offset by startup investment costs associated with transitioning information and technology support to a new third party provider and higher operating expenses. Capital expenditures for Entertainment were $54.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 versus $93.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. II 18  Video (Home videocassette, DVD and video game rental and retail operations) (Contributed 23% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, 22% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 25% for the year ended December 31, 2000).

Domestic revenues increased 6% while international revenues increased 13%. International revenues represented approximately 21% of Video revenues, with approximately 55% from Europe and 23% from Canada. Worldwide same store revenues, which includes rental and retail product, increased 5.1% primarily resulting from 32.6% growth in same store retail revenues, and 0.9% growth in same store rental revenues over the prior year. Domestic and international same store revenues increased 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Blockbusters rental revenues are generated from the rental of VHS tapes, DVDs, video games and from any eventual sale of previously rented VHS tapes, DVDs and video games. Revenues generated from rental transactions include revenues received in connection with the initial rentals of product, as well as revenues received in connection with any continuation of such rentals past the initial rental period, as contemplated by Blockbusters membership agreement. For 2002, Video operating income increased to $355.8 million from a loss of $219.6 million reflecting the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and the charge taken in 2001. Assuming operating income was adjusted for SFAS 142 and excluding the charge described in the footnote above, operating income would have increased 2%. Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for lease obligations related to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in January 2003. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these lease guarantees. The Company has accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations and the $18.7 million had no impact on the Companys operating results for 2002. During the second half of 2002, Blockbuster continued its focus on the sale of new movies and games as a complement to its rental offering in order to accommodate increased demand for retail product. As a result of this increased focus, Blockbuster continued to expand the selection in its stores for DVD and games hardware and software. Blockbuster also continued to take advantage of its ability to offer promotions that combine film rentals with sales of popular retail titles, thereby providing an alternative to the offerings that can be provided by a traditional retailer. Blockbuster expects these types of promotions, II 19 as well as customer traffic generated by its rental business, to continue to drive increased retail sales. While much of the retail product is returnable to vendors, the increased investment in inventory necessary to capitalize on these initiatives increases Blockbusters exposure to excess inventories in the event anticipated sales fail to materialize. Blockbuster experienced some softness in its business during December 2002 which could be attributable primarily to aggressive price competition from mass market retailers. Blockbuster ended 2002 with 8,545 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 495 company operated stores and 69 franchise stores over December 31, 2001. Capital expenditures for Video were $140.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily due to new store openings and expenditures related to Blockbusters retail initiatives during 2002. Viacom currently owns approximately 80.4% of Blockbuster (NYSE: BBI). 2001 vs. 2000 For 2001, Video revenues increased 4% driven by higher worldwide same store sales and an increase in the number of company operated stores of 158. Domestic revenues increased 3% while international revenues, which represented approximately 20% of Videos revenues, increased 8%. Worldwide same store revenues, which include rental and retail products, increased 2.5%, driven by international same store sales up 12.6% as a result of copy depth programs in key international markets and the growth in DVD revenues. Worldwide same store rental revenues increased 2.1%, with domestic same store rental revenues increasing 0.5% and international same store rental revenues increasing by 10.7%. Videos operating income for 2001 decreased as a result of the 2001 charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters, principally related to the elimination of less productive VHS tapes as part of the transition from VHS to the higher margin DVD rental market and a change in amortization. Blockbuster experienced an improvement in profit margins primarily due to an increase in the percentage of rental revenues from DVDs which, on average, have a lower cost than VHS rental products, an increase in margins on domestic game rentals, and an increase in margins on previously rented products which on average sell at a higher average unit selling price because of higher DVD mix. For the year, compensation and occupancy costs increased principally driven by store growth and increased customer service initiatives. Capital expenditures for Blockbuster were $93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $212.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Blockbuster ended 2001 with 7,981 company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 158 company operated and 146 franchise stores over 2000. Restructuring, Blockbuster and Merger Related Charges Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of 2001, MTV Networks announced a restructuring plan to reduce headcount in its domestic and foreign offices and close certain offices in Latin America, Europe and Asia. Having met the conditions required by EITF Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3"), the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $66.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $8.8 million in depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2001. Included in the restructuring charge was severance of $58.3 million for the termination of 449 domestic staff employees, 26 information systems employees and 151 employees in Latin America, Europe and Asia across various levels and departments including sales and marketing, production, development, finance, online and creative services. The reserve also included lease termination and other occupancy costs of $8.3 million for vacated office space in New York. During 2002, an incremental $8.3 million was accrued as additional lease termination costs based on a revision to the initial estimate. As of December 31, 2002, all employees under the plan were terminated and the Company had paid and charged $47.1 million against the severance liability of which $11.4 million was paid and charged during 2001. As of December 31, 2002, $9.5 million was paid and charged against the lease termination liability; no payments were made against this liability in 2001. Severance and lease payments will continue into 2003 since certain employees will be paid out over the terms of their II 20 employment contracts and lease payments will continue to be paid in accordance with the terms of the lease. In the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with the Companys plan to integrate UPN with CBS Network operations and, having met the conditions required by EITF 94 3, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $52.8 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $.6 million in depreciation and amortization. The restructuring charge included programming write offs of $29.6 million and approximately $15.0 million of employee related costs, including severance, for the termination of 38 employees across various levels and departments including corporate, finance and administration, sales and marketing and affiliate relations. The reserve also included lease termination and other costs of $8.2 million for vacated space at three of UPNs offices. The integration of UPN with CBS Network operations began in January 2002 and was completed by the end of the year. During 2002, a $5.4 million revision to initial estimates resulted in a reduction in lease termination and other costs and an increase in programming write offs. Additionally, as of December 31, 2002, $3.0 million of severance liabilities was reversed due to a change in estimate. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had paid and charged approximately $11.3 million against the severance liability associated with the termination of the employees and $1.2 million against the lease termination and other costs. There were no payments charged against the reserve in 2001. Severance payments will continue into 2003 since certain employees will be paid out over the terms of their employment contracts. Blockbuster Charge During the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster began implementation of a strategic re merchandising plan to allow for an expansion of store space for DVD and other strategic product offerings, which it completed by December 31, 2001. In connection with its plan, Blockbuster disposed of approximately 30% of its rental VHS library in its stores, certain VHS merchandise inventory primarily located in its distribution center and certain games from its rental library in its stores. The net book value of the eliminated inventory, net of proceeds, resulted in a primarily non cash charge of approximately $195.9 million to operating expenses in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Blockbuster also recorded a charge of approximately $26.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to employee, labor and supply and disposal costs to execute the plan. Additionally, $2.6 million was charged to depreciation expense for the write off of fixed assets and $1.9 million was charged below operating income to equity in loss of affiliated companies for the adoption of a similar re merchandising plan at one of Blockbusters joint venture operations. The plan was completed by the end of 2001 through the destruction or sale of the identified items. Also, during the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster recorded approximately $27.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to two lawsuits. The amounts described above, and including the $141.7 million recorded as the change in accounting estimates for rental inventory, represented the 2001 pre tax charge of approximately $396.6 million. Merger Related Charge In the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a non recurring merger related charge of $698.5 million ($504.5 million after tax or $.41 per share), associated with the integration of Viacom and CBS and the acquisition of UPN. This amount included a non cash charge of $415.5 million principally attributable to compensation for stock options and $283.0 million of cash payments and accrued liabilities for severance, transaction fees and integration costs. During 2002, a $9.0 million revision to initial estimates resulted in a reduction of liabilities for transaction fees and an increase to severance and integration liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company paid and charged approximately $14.7 million for severance liabilities, $15.6 million for integration costs and the remaining liabilities for transaction fees of $14.1 million were released. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company paid and charged $17.0 million for severance liabilities, $0.4 million for transaction fees and $63.0 million for integration costs. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company paid and charged $92.1 million for severance liabilities, $26.5 million for transaction fees and $6.0 million for integration costs. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately $33.6 million remaining for severance and integration costs and the Company expects to substantially use these reserves by the end of 2003. II 21 Financial Position Current assets increased to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2002 from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2001 primarily due to an increase of $414.0 million in current inventory and an increase of $139.2 million in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease of $96.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in current inventory reflects an additional $249.2 million investment in merchandise inventory to support Blockbusters initiatives to increase its share of the retail VHS and DVD market. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 7.0% at December 31, 2002 compared with 7.1% at December 31, 2001. Net property and equipment decreased $222.5 million to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2002 from $6.3 billion at December 31, 2001 primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $843.9 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $537.1 million principally for outdoor advertising structures, video stores, construction of new park rides, and broadcasting equipment. Non current inventory increased $191.4 million to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2002 from $4.3 billion at December 31, 2001 primarily due to an increase in program rights and rental inventory. Goodwill of $57.1 billion decreased from $59.1 billion at December 31, 2001, reflecting the write off of goodwill related to Blockbuster as a result of the implementation of SFAS 142. Intangibles increased $601.5 million to $12.5 billion at December 31, 2002 from $11.9 billion at December 31, 2001, primarily reflecting the addition of FCC licenses with the acquisition of KCAL TV in May 2002. Current liabilities decreased to $7.3 billion at December 31, 2002 from $7.6 billion at December 31, 2001 primarily due to reductions of $342.6 million in accrued participations, largely offset by an increase of $231.2 million in accounts payable. Total debt, including current maturities, decreased $718.5 million to $10.4 billion at December 31, 2002 principally reflecting the use of cash from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Minority interest of $845.2 million at December 31, 2002 decreased $366.6 million from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2001 reflecting the impact on minority owners from the implementation of SFAS 142 and the acquisition of the minority interest in the Companys online music business. Cash Flows Operating Activities. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected net earnings of $725.7 million adjusted for non cash charges of $1.5 billion for the adoption of SFAS 142 and depreciation and amortization of $945.6 million. Additionally, operating cash flow benefited from the utilization of deferred tax assets of $655 million and from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $210 million. These increases were partially offset by an additional investment in Blockbusters merchandise and rental inventory and increased program rights for television series and sports. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected a net loss of $223.5 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense of $3.1 billion, and for the 2001 Blockbuster, MTVN and UPN charges plus decreases in accounts receivable, partially offset by payments of accrued expenses and accounts payable. Cash paid for income taxes of $630.1 million for 2002 were favorably impacted by the settlement of federal income tax audits and the recognition of tax benefits associated with non recurring items. Cash income taxes for 2003 will be higher due to expected higher operating income and the absence of the 2002 non recurring items and are expected to be in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Investing Activities. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected capital expenditures of $537.1 million, additional investments of $60.8 million in affiliated companies and acquisitions of $926.0 million primarily reflecting the acquisition of KCAL TV and the remaining interest in Noggin that the Company did not already own. Activity in 2002 also reflected Blockbusters acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in an Italy joint venture and the acquisition of a games retailer in the United Kingdom. During 2002, the Company acquired shares of Blockbusters Class A common stock for $11.2 million to maintain its ownership position at no less than II 22 80% for tax consolidation purposes. This purchase of subsidiary stock was reflected as part of acquisitions. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets of $72.2 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected the acquisitions of BET and outdoor businesses and capital expenditures of $515.4 million partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of radio stations and other assets. Financing Activities. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.0 billion, the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $1.2 billion, and the purchase of shares of Company stock for $1.1 billion. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.3 billion and from the exercise of stock employee options of $357.6 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflected $1.6 billion net repayment of debt and $1.1 billion used to purchase Company stock, partially offset by proceeds of $184.6 million from the exercise of employee stock options. Stock Purchase Program During 2002, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 27.8 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.2 billion under its stock purchase programs, of which $350.7 million was spent in the fourth quarter for 8.1 million shares. As of December 31, 2002, there was approximately $2.9 billion remaining under the current $3.0 billion purchase program. From January 1, through March 10, 2003, the Company purchased an additional 1.8 million shares for approximately $75.4 million. Acquisitions On May 15, 2002, the Company acquired the assets of KCAL TV Los Angeles for approximately $650 million. During 2002, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% interest in Noggin, the 24 hour digital network for kids that it did not already own for approximately $100 million. Blockbuster acquired the 51% interest that it did not already own in a joint venture in Italy and also acquired a games retailer in the United Kingdom for approximately $82.4 million in the aggregate in 2002. In November 2001, the Company completed the television station swaps of WDCA TV Washington D.C. and KTXH TV Houston in exchange for KBHK TV San Francisco. As a result of the swaps, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $210.1 million in "Other items, net". On February 21, 2001, the Company completed a merger with Infinity, acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock that it did not already own, approximately 36%. Under the terms of the merger, which was tax free for the stockholders of Infinity and Viacom, each issued and outstanding share of Infinity Class A common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.592 of a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock. The Infinity merger was accounted for at historical cost, with the exception of minority interest, which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price of approximately $13.4 billion represented the issuance of approximately 231.6 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the fair value of Infinity stock options assumed by the Company. Infinity stockholders received a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares. The goodwill attributable to this transaction was approximately $7.7 billion. On January 23, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of BET for approximately $3 billion, which principally represented the net issuance of approximately 43.0 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption by the Company of approximately $590 million in debt. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. An allocation of the total cost to acquire BET was based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of the acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of II 23 approximately $2.9 billion was allocated to intangibles. As of the acquisition date, BETs results are included as part of the Cable Networks segment. On May 4, 2000, CBS was merged with and into the Company. The total purchase price of approximately $39.8 billion included approximately $37.7 billion for the issuance of 825.5 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and 11,004 shares of Viacom Series C convertible preferred stock, which were subsequently converted into 11.0 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock, and approximately $1.9 billion for the fair value of CBS stock options assumed by the Company and transaction costs. In addition, Viacom assumed approximately $3.7 billion of CBS debt. Capital Structure At December 31, 2002 2001 Notes payable to banks $ 423.7 $ 645.0 Commercial paper 174.6 1,104.3 Senior debt 9,530.7 9,187.5 Senior subordinated debt 56.1 50.8 Subordinated exchange debentures 19.8 Other notes 28.6 16.2 Obligations under capital leases 392.2 452.0 Total Debt 10,605.9 11,475.6 Less current portion 199.0 299.0 Less discontinued operations debt (a) 201.7 352.9 Total Long Term Debt $ 10,205.2 $ 10,823.7 (a)Included in "Other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. Total debt of $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2001 were 14.5% and 15.5%, respectively, as a percentage of total capitalization of the Company. The senior, senior subordinated, and subordinated debt of each of Viacom Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Viacom International Inc., is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Viacom International Inc. and Viacom Inc., respectively. The senior debt and senior subordinated debt of the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries, CBS Broadcasting Inc. and Go Outdoor Systems Holdings S.A., respectively, are not guaranteed; the aggregate outstanding amount of such debt at December 31, 2002 was $108.3 million. The Companys total debt presented above includes, for the period ending December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively, (i) an aggregate unamortized premium of $49.5 million and $49.4 million and (ii) the change in the carrying value of the debt relating to fair value swaps of $86.2 million and $2.8 million. II 24 For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the following debt issuances, maturities and redemptions occurred: Debt Issuances August 28, 2002, $600.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2012 April 25, 2002, $700.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2007 June 29, 2001, $335.0 million 7.25% senior notes due 2051 May 17, 2001, $400.0 million 6.40% senior notes due 2006 May 17, 2001, $1.0 billion 6.625% senior notes due 2011 January 17, 2001, $400.0 million 6.40% senior notes due 2006 January 17, 2001, $500.0 million 7.70% senior notes due 2010 January 17, 2001, $750.0 million 7.875% senior debentures due 2030 Interest on all of the above notes is paid semi annually except for the 7.25% senior notes which is paid quarterly. Debt Maturities June 15, 2002, 8.375% notes, $321.8 million January 15, 2002, 7.50% senior notes, $250.0 million January 1, 2002, 7.625% senior notes, $143.0 million September 15, 2001, 10.25% senior subordinated notes, $35.3 million June 1, 2001, 8.875% notes, $230.0 million Debt Redemptions August 1, 2002, $239.5 million 8.25% senior debentures due 2022 at 103.5% of principal June 15, 2002, $2.6 million 8.875% senior subordinated notes due 2007 at 104.4% of principal June 1, 2002, $31.1 million 8.875% senior debentures due 2022 at 104.1% of principal January 15, 2002, $18.7 million 11.375% subordinated exchange debentures due 2009 at 105.7% of principal February 1, 2001, $60.3 million 9.00% senior subordinated notes due 2006 at 104.5% of principal October 15, 2001, $151.5 million 9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2006 at 104.7% of principal For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company repurchased approximately $55.0 million and $427.7 million of its debt, respectively. The Companys scheduled maturities of long term debt at face value, excluding commercial paper and capital leases, outstanding at December 31, 2002 are as follows: Year of Maturity 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 & thereafter Long term debt $ 874.8 $ 176.6 $ 1,473.2 $ 801.4 $ 700.1 $ 5,874.3 II 25 Viacom Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2002, the Companys credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, totaled $4.75 billion comprised of $1.45 billion and $1.5 billion 5 year revolving credit facilities and a $1.8 billion 364 day revolving credit facility. The $1.45 billion and $1.5 billion facilities are scheduled to expire in 2005 and 2006, respectively. On February 28, 2003, the Company entered into a $1.7 billion 364 day credit facility to replace the $1.8 billion facility which was to expire in March 2003. The terms and conditions of the $1.7 billion facility are substantially similar to the $1.8 billion facility. As of February 28, 2003, the Companys credit facilities total $4.65 billion. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the $1.5 billion facility. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined at the Companys option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Companys senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.51 billion in the aggregate. The facilities contain certain covenants, which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants. The primary purpose of the credit facilities is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2002, the Company had commercial paper borrowings of $174.6 million under its $4.75 billion commercial paper program. The Companys credit facilities supporting the commercial paper borrowings totaled $4.65 billion at February 28, 2003. Borrowings under the program have maturities of less than a year. At December 31, 2002, the Company had classified approximately $939.6 million of commercial paper and other debt scheduled to mature within the next twelve months as long term debt, reflecting its intent and ability, through the existence of unused revolving credit facilities, to refinance this debt on a long term basis. Blockbuster Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2002, Blockbusters credit agreement (the "Blockbuster Credit Agreement") was comprised of a $600.0 million long term revolver due July 1, 2004 and a $410.0 million term loan due in quarterly installments ending July 1, 2004. Blockbuster had $600.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the long term revolver at December 31, 2002. Blockbuster has the ability with this available borrowing capacity to extend the maturities of the current portion of the term loan. Interest rates under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement are based on the prime rate in the United States or LIBOR (plus a margin, or "LIBOR spread," based on leverage ratios, which is currently 1.25%) at Blockbusters option at the time of borrowing. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2002 for borrowings under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement was 3.1%. A variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver (0.25% at December 31, 2002). The Blockbuster Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment of dividends, purchase of Blockbusters common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2002, Blockbuster was in compliance with all covenants under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement. Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs As of December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001, the Company had an aggregate of $981.9 million and $950.0 million, respectively, outstanding under revolving receivable securitization programs. The programs result in the sale of receivables on a non recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable and debt on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these arrangements because they provide a cost efficient form of financing and an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from the programs were used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The Company is required to maintain certain ratios in connection with the programs. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization programs. II 26  Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes that its operating cash flow ($3.1 billion in 2002), cash and cash equivalents ($631.4 million at December 31, 2002), borrowing capacity under committed bank facilities (which consisted of unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.51 billion in the aggregate at December 31, 2002), and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, including commitments and contingencies, capital and investing commitments and its financing requirements for the foreseeable future. The funding for commitments to purchase sports programming rights, television and film operations, and talent contracts will come primarily from cash flow from operations. The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include capital expenditures, share purchases, acquisitions, and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activity available to meet these needs. Any net cash funding requirements are financed with short term borrowings (primarily commercial paper) and long term debt. Commercial paper borrowings, which also accommodate day to day changes in funding requirements, are backed by committed bank facilities that may be utilized in the event that commercial paper borrowings are not available. The Companys strong credit position, which is reflected by an A /A3 rating, affords access to the capital markets. The Company anticipates that scheduled debt maturities in 2003 will be funded with cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operating activities. There are no provisions in any of the Companys material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in the Companys debt ratings. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock and warrants of Viacom that may be issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 billion. The registration statement was first declared effective on January 8, 2001. The net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by Viacom for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital and capital expenditures, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. To date, the Company has issued $1.635 billion of securities under the shelf registration statement. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company had a total of $1.1 billion of long term debt maturities, redemptions and repurchases and issued $1.3 billion of long term debt. The long term debt issuances maintained the Companys unused borrowing capacity and its financial flexibility. Planned capital expenditures for 2003 are approximately $600 million to $625 million. The Company spent $537.1 million during 2002. Capital expenditures are funded with cash flows from operations. Commitments and Contingencies The following table presents the Companys significant unrecorded contractual commitments as of December 31, 2002: 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 & thereafter Programming and talent commitments $ 3,042.3 $ 2,273.8 $ 2,004.3 $ 1,055.3 $ 886.7 $ 4,283.0 Operating leases $ 930.9 $ 791.5 $ 662.4 $ 637.8 $ 422.9 $ 1,725.3 Capital lease obligations (including interest) $ 118.1 $ 90.5 $ 75.2 $ 62.1 $ 52.0 $ 102.9 Guaranteed minimum franchise payments $ 378.2 $ 342.1 $ 303.6 $ 212.4 $ 81.3 $ 156.5 II 27 Commitments At December 31, 2002, programming and talent commitments of the Company not reflected on the balance sheet are estimated to aggregate approximately $13.5 billion. These commitments include approximately $9.3 billion for the acquisition of sports programming rights, approximately $3.1 billion relating to television, radio and feature film production and acquisitions and approximately $1.1 billion for talent contracts. A majority of such fees are payable over several years, as part of the normal course of business. The Company has long term noncancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. The Company has also entered into capital leases for satellite transponders and buildings. Viacoms outdoor advertising business has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media such as buses, trains, bus shelters, terminals, billboards, and phone kiosks. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchiser is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. At December 31, 2002, future guaranteed minimum franchise payments not reflected on the balance sheet are estimated to aggregate approximately $1.5 billion. Guarantees The Company owns a 50% equity interest in United Cinemas International ("UCI"), which operates movie theaters in Europe, Latin America and Asia. As of December 31, 2002, the Company guaranteed approximately $250.6 million of UCIs debt obligations under a revolving credit facility which expires in December 2004, and $155.5 million of UCIs theater leases. The Company also owns a 50% interest in WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. and Graumans Theatres, LLC and guarantees certain theater leases for approximately $14.7 million. The debt and lease guarantees would only be triggered upon non payment by the respective primary obligors. These guarantees are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. Additionally, the Company has letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $405.2 million at December 31, 2002 and are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company is also subject to certain off balance sheet lease guarantees related to the divestitures of certain businesses. In October 1998, Blockbuster Music stores were sold to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. ("Wherehouse"). Some of the leases transferred in connection with this sale had previously been guaranteed either by the Company or its affiliates. The remaining initial terms of these leases expire on various dates through 2007. However, certain leases contain renewal options that can extend the primary lease term and remain subject to the guarantee. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to any amount paid under these guarantees. On January 21, 2003, Wherehouse filed a petition for protection under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law. Based on information regarding lease and guaranty expirations provided to Blockbuster by Wherehouse in connection with its bankruptcy, Blockbusters current estimate of the contingent liability is approximately $36.0 million. Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 which represented its estimate of the undiscounted lease guaranty obligation associated with the stores that Wherehouse has indicated it will vacate. The Company has accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations. Legal Matters Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse II 28 was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had pending approximately 103,800 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 106,000 as of December 31, 2001 and approximately 100,000 as of December 31, 2000. The 2001 and 2000 numbers of claims included approximately 7,100 claims and 1,900 claims, respectively, on an inactive docket in Baltimore which would not be counted as pending under the Companys current methodology. In addition, the pending claim count was reduced by approximately 24,000 claims as a result of the Supreme Court of New Yorks order dated December 2002 establishing a deferred docket of claimants alleging minimal or no impairment. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2002, approximately 73,900 were pending in state courts, 27,100 in federal court and approximately 2,800 were third party claims. During 2002, the Company received approximately 49,400 new claims and closed approximately 18,500 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs in 2002 and 2001 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $28 million and $21 million, respectively. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities and that these asbestos liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort claims arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. Antitrust. In March 2001, after a series of judicial rulings, three individuals remained as plaintiffs in a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas against the Company, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment, and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries. They asserted, among other things, that the Company, Blockbuster and the studios conspired to fix the prices of videos to retailers and distributors, engaged in discriminatory pricing, and conspired to restrain competition. They were seeking treble damages for themselves and injunctive relief under both federal and California state law. In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the defendants. Plaintiffs have appealed the judgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2001, a similar complaint was filed in California in a Los Angeles County Superior Court by over 200 individual plaintiffs seeking class certification and monetary damages against the same defendants. In January 2002, the California court denied the plaintiffs request for class certification, and the plaintiffs have appealed that decision to a California appellate court. By order dated February 20, 2003, the California state court judge dismissed with prejudice all claims against the defendants. The Company believes that the plaintiffs II 29 position in these litigations is without merit and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in the litigations. Blockbuster Securities Action. During February and March 2003, three putative class action complaints were filed against Blockbuster in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas claiming violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and seeking a class determination for purchasers of Blockbuster stock for the approximately eight month period between April and December 2002. Certain members of Blockbusters senior management are also named as defendants. A shareholder derivative action arising from the same operative facts was filed in February 2003 in the same court; and another shareholder derivative action was filed in March 2003 in the 160th Judicial District Court for Dallas County, Texas claiming breach of fiduciary duties for an approximately three week period from late April through mid May 2002. These actions named certain Blockbuster directors, some of whom are directors and or executive officers of the Company, and certain members of Blockbusters senior management, as individual defendants, and Blockbuster as a nominal defendant. Responses have not yet been filed to any of these lawsuits. The Company believes the plaintiffs positions in these lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend these matters. Other. The Company has amounts owed by an international licensee under a series of long term licensing arrangements covering feature film and television product. The licensee is disputing its obligation to accept and to pay for a portion of this product under certain of these arrangements. The Company has brought suit to enforce its rights under those arrangements and strongly believes in the merits of its position. The licensee is attempting to reorganize under German insolvency law. As a result, the Company may be unable to recover some or all of amounts being sought in the litigation, as well as the undisputed sums owing under these arrangements. The Company however, believes that the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that all of the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business with companies in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the non designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of "Other items, net". The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2002, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $266.0 million, of which $49.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $217.0 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. At December 31, 2001, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $268.1 million, of II 30 which $76.6 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $191.5 million represented hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. Approximately 90% of consolidated revenues are generated in U.S. dollars, accordingly, a 10% fluctuation in foreign currrency rates would not have a material effect on results of operations. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is exposed to movements in short term rates. Swap agreements are used to modify this exposure. This includes both fixed to variable rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, and variable to fixed rate swaps, which are designed as cash flow hedges. Based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2002, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause a $23.7 million change to pre tax earnings. As of December 31, 2002 if both parties were to agree, the swaps could have been terminated by a net payment from the counterparties of approximately $75.1 million. On January 23, 2001, the Company, in connection with the acquisition of BET, assumed $425 million of cash flow swap agreements which effectively converted variable rate debt to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2002, the notional amount outstanding was approximately $175 million. The notional amount of swaps amortizes by approximately $156 million in September of 2003 and matures in September 2004. Interest is received based upon three month LIBOR and is paid at approximately 5.07%. The amount of the ineffectiveness of these cash flow hedges that was reflected in earnings was immaterial. The effective portion of the change in value of cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During the next twelve months, approximately $5.0 million will be amortized into earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedges included in earnings was not material. The change in value of the fair value hedges and the hedged instruments is reported in earnings for the periods presented. During December 2001, the Company entered into $750 million notional amount swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. Of the $750 million notional amount, $225 million matures on January 15, 2003, $275 million matures on September 1, 2003 and $250 million matures on June 1, 2005, and the Company receives interest at approximately 3.2%, 3.8% and 4.5%, respectively, and pays three month LIBOR. These fair value hedges were fully effective. During November 2002, the 3.2% and 3.8% swap agreements entered in December 2001 were terminated by the Company and the Company received approximately $8.7 million in cash which is being amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the respective debt. On April 24, 2002, the Company entered into additional $700 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2007 and the Company receives interest at approximately 5.11% on $400 million and 5.35% on $300 million, and pays three month LIBOR. Credit Risk The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions, which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. The Companys receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2002 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Companys products and services are sold. II 31 Related Parties National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") is a closely held corporation that beneficially owns the Companys Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 69% of the voting power of all classes of the Companys Common Stock, and approximately 11% of the Companys Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis at December 31, 2002. Owners of the Companys Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. The Companys Class B Common Stock does not have voting rights. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios including Paramount Pictures, a division of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, NAI made payments to Paramount Pictures in the aggregate amounts of approximately $12.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. The Company owns a minority equity interest in Westwood One, Inc. ("Westwood One"). Most of Infinitys radio stations are affiliated with Westwood One, and Westwood One distributes nationally certain of the Companys radio programming. In connection with these arrangements, the Company receives affiliation fees as well as programming cost reimbursements and in certain instances, shares in revenue from the sale by Westwood One of Infinitys programming. In addition, certain employees of Infinity serve as officers of Westwood One for which the Company receives a management fee. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $110.4 million, $94.8 million and $77.6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Recent Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"), effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs. SFAS 143 requires the capitalization of any retirement costs as part of the total cost of the related long lived asset and the subsequent allocation of the total expense to future periods using a systematic and rational method. In accordance with its provisions, the Company will record a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the first quarter of 2003 in connection with the implementation of this standard. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the Companys statements of operations, financial position or cash flows. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 144 establishes an accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, including discontinued operations. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Effective December 31, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 145 "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS 145"). SFAS 145 no longer requires gains and losses from the extinguishments of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item. Adoption of SFAS 145 resulted in the reclassification of $3.9 million of extraordinary loss net of tax, recorded for the year ended December 31, 2001 to interest expense. In June of 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"), effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS 146 requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. The adoption of SFAS 146 will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. II 32 Effective December 31, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148"), an amendment of Statement No. 123. SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition to a voluntary adoption of the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. In November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates. Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with SOP 00 2, which requires managements judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments. The cost of Blockbusters rental library, which includes videocassettes, DVDs and games, is amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 12 months to an estimated residual value of $2 to $5 per unit, according to the product category. The estimates for useful lives and residual values of the rental library are continually evaluated based on changes in consumer demand. Changes in demand or buying patterns may impact the carrying value of the rental library and rental margins. During 2001, Blockbuster changed the estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for videocassettes and game products, which resulted in inventory write downs and increased amortization expense. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and II 33 liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. The Company assesses potential impairment of long lived assets under the guidance of SFAS 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of." Goodwill and other intangibles are evaluated for impairment under the guidance of SFAS 142 which was adopted in the first quarter of 2002. Upon adoption, the Company determined that based on segment valuation studies with the exception of Blockbuster, none of the Companys reporting units had an impairment. The write down of Blockbusters goodwill of $1.8 billion was determined after the fair value of Blockbuster had been allocated to specific assets and liabilites and was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Subsequently, Blockbuster performed its annual impairment test on October 31, 2002 and there was no additional impairment under the provisions of SFAS 142 for 2002. SFAS 142 requires companies to test for goodwill impairment annually and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below the units carrying amount. During December 2002, Blockbuster performed an interim impairment test on its goodwill balance as of December 31, 2002 which determined that its estimated fair value, under SFAS 142, was in excess of book value. As a result, there was no additional impairment. Blockbuster will perform its annual impairment test for 2003 on October 31, 2003, and on an interim date in 2003 should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the estimated future cash flows could result in a material impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142. The Companys cost and equity investments, where market value has declined below cost, are regularly reviewed by management to determine whether or not there has been an other than temporary decline in market value. In making that determination, management considers the extent to which cost exceeds market value, the duration of the market decline, the investees earnings and cash forecasts and current cash position, among other factors. In 2002, the Company recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately $13.8 million. In 2001, the Company recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately $125.0 million. Balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to taxes, legal issues, restructuring charges and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments and estimates by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued business, including environmental and asbestos are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled. The Company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption. The expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. For 2002, the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension plans increased significantly as a result of lowering the discount rate for the Companys major plans from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.50% in 2002, other actuarial losses and plan assets producing a return below the expected return due to market conditions in 2002. As of December 31, 2002, total pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of corresponding plan assets and therefore the Company recorded an additional pension liability of $865.0 million. The expected increased pension expense due to decreases in pension plan II 34 asset values and expected rate of return on such assets will not result in increased Company pension plan contributions. Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements This document and the documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition", contain both historical and forward looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect the Companys current expectations concerning future results and events. These forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect", "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will" or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe the Companys objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. The following important factors, among others, could affect future results, causing these results to differ materially from those expressed in the Companys forward looking statements: The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its over the air networks, basic cable networks, television stations, radio stations and outdoor businesses. The sale of advertising is affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising. Adverse changes to any of these factors, including as a result of acts of terrorism or war, could have a negative effect on revenues. Additionally, consumer and advertiser actions in response to the war in Iraq could have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. Operating results derived from the Companys motion picture and television production businesses fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public, which are difficult to predict. Motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent, reduced availability of co financing opportunities, and other factors have resulted in higher production costs. In addition, the commercial success of the Companys motion picture and television productions depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions, and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities. The Companys operating results fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases, as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition. The Companys basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent upon affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home ("DTH") distributors on acceptable terms. The loss of carriage on such distributors, or continued carriage on less favorable terms, could adversely affect, with respect to basic cable networks, revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising, and with respect to premium subscription television networks, subscriber fee revenues. In addition, continued consolidation among cable and or DTH distributors could have an adverse effect on subscriber fee revenues. Some of the Companys businesses are seasonal. The home video and consumer publishing businesses are subject to increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays, while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is generated from May through II 35 September. In addition, the home video and theme parks businesses revenues are influenced by weather. The Companys radio and outdoor advertising businesses experience fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers and typically experience highest revenues in the fourth quarter and lowest revenues in the first quarter. The Companys home video retail business currently enjoys a competitive advantage over most other movie distribution channels, except theatrical releases, due to the early timing of the video retailer "distribution window." The Video business could be negatively affected if the video retail distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release; the length of the video retail distribution window was shortened; or the video retail distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now. The Company believes that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable video retail industry; however, the order, length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie and the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of any future decisions by the studios. Increased studio licensing of product to video on demand and similar services might impact their decisions with respect to the timing and exclusivity of the video retailer distribution window with possible adverse affect on the Video business. The Company cannot control or predict with certainty studio pricing policies for DVD and VHS product. "Sell through" pricing of DVDs has reduced the significance of the "rental window" for VHS product and has resulted in competition from mass merchant retailers at an earlier stage than is the case for VHS. If sell through pricing and competition cause consumers to increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies, the Video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to increase rental market share, to replace profits from rentals with profits from sales of sell through product, or to otherwise positively affect gross profits. In addition, if studios make future changes in their pricing policies, which could include pricing rental windows for DVDs or expanded exploitation by studios of any international copyright laws that allow studios to charge retailers more for DVD and VHS rental product than for sell through product, the profitability of the Video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to enter into arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations. Changes in FCC laws and regulations could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the operations and ownership of the Companys properties. The Company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued businesses, including environmental liabilities and pending litigation. While the pending or potential litigations, and environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance in this regard. The Company may be adversely affected by changes in technology and its effect on competition in the Companys markets, including technologies that increase the threat of content piracy. Other economic, business, competitive and or regulatory factors could affect the Companys businesses generally. These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results. The forward looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document, and the Company does not have any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. The Company cannot make any assurances that projected results or events will be achieved.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. (Tabular dollars in millions) Managements discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Overview Viacom Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries ("Viacom" or the "Company") is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations, during 2002, in the following segments: CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of MTV Networks ("MTVN") including MTV MUSIC TELEVISION, NICKELODEON/NICK AT NITE, VH1 MUSIC FIRST, MTV2 MUSIC TELEVISION, TV LAND, NOGGIN, TNN: THE NATIONAL NETWORK, CMT: COUNTRY MUSIC TELEVISION; SHOWTIME NETWORKS INC. ("SNI"); and the BET CABLE NETWORK and BET JAZZ: THE JAZZ CHANNEL, among other program services. Cable Networks revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales and affiliate fees. TELEVISION: The Television segment consists of the CBS and UPN television networks, the Companys owned broadcast television stations, and its television production and syndication business, including KING WORLD PRODUCTIONS, and PARAMOUNT TELEVISION. Television generates revenues primarily from advertising sales and television license fees. INFINITY: The Infinity segment owns and operates 185 radio stations through INFINITY RADIO and owns and or operates outdoor advertising properties through VIACOM OUTDOOR. Infinity revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales. Beginning January 1, 2003, the Company operates Infinity as two segments, RADIO and OUTDOOR. Future disclosure of segment results will conform to this new presentation.

Entertainment revenues are generated primarily from feature film exploitation, publishing, theme park operations and movie theaters. VIDEO: The Video segment consists of an approximately 80.4% equity interest in Blockbuster Inc., which operates and franchises BLOCKBUSTER video stores worldwide. Video generates revenues primarily from its rental and retail sales of videocassettes, DVDs and games. II 3 The following table presents the contributions to consolidated revenues from each segment for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Percentage Contribution of Revenues by Segment Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Cable Networks 19 % 19 % 20 % Television 30 31 27 Infinity 15 16 14 Entertainment 15 15 17 Video 23 22 25 Eliminations (2 ) (3 ) (3 ) Total 100 % 100 % 100 % The Companys consolidated revenues were $24.6 billion, $23.2 billion and $20.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company generated approximately 16%, 16% and 18% of its total revenues from international regions in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, approximately 56% and 23% of international revenues of $4.0 billion were generated in Europe and Canada, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, approximately 54% and 23% of total international revenues of $3.8 billion were generated in Europe and Canada, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2000, approximately 54% and 23% of total international revenues of $3.6 billion were generated in Europe and Canada, respectively. The tables below present the Companys consolidated revenues by type and the percentage and amount of contribution of each type of revenue to consolidated revenues, net of intercompany eliminations, for each of the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Revenues by Type Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Advertising sales $ 11,225.4 $ 10,723.2 $ 8,143.6 Rental/retail sales 5,480.1 5,049.9 4,866.5 Affiliate fees 2,199.0 2,030.9 1,694.1 TV license fees 1,506.9 1,385.4 1,558.6 Features film exploitation 1,827.3 1,824.6 1,675.6 Other(a) 2,367.0 2,208.8 2,105.3 Total $ 24,605.7 $ 23,222.8 $ 20,043.7 Percentage of Revenues by Type Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Advertising sales 46 % 46 % 41 % Rental/retail sales 22 22 24 Affiliate fees 9 9 8 TV license fees 6 6 8 Feature film exploitation 7 8 8 Other(a) 10 9 11 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (a) Other primarily includes revenues from publishing, theme park operations, movie theaters, home video and royalties and fees. II 4 Consolidated Results of Operations 2002 vs. 2001 and 2001 vs. 2000 Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2002, revenues of $24.6 billion increased 6% from 2001 primarily driven by increases in advertising revenues, with additional contributions from increases in rental/retail sales, television license fees and affiliate fees. For the year ended December 31, 2001, revenues increased 16% to $23.2 billion from 2000. Revenue increases resulted from higher advertising sales, rental/retail sales, feature film revenues and affiliate fees partially offset by a decrease in television license fees. 2000 results reflect only eight months of CBS operations effective from May 4, 2000 when CBS Corporation merged with and into the Company, (the "Viacom/CBS Merger"). Advertising sales increased 5% in 2002 led by increases of 12% in the Cable Networks segment, 4% in the Television segment and 2% in the Infinity segment. The aggregate increase in advertising revenue was driven primarily by increased units sold at cable networks, as well as increases in average unit rates and units sold at the broadcast network operations. The Company benefited from the recovery and strength of the advertising market in 2002, especially during the second half of the year. Early indications in 2003 suggest continuing improvement in the advertising market; however advertising sales are dependent upon various factors, including continued strong ratings, and the strength of the overall economy and the advertising market. In particular, world events, including war or terrorism, could have an adverse effect on the advertising market. Advertising sales growth in 2001 versus 2000 was driven by the Viacom/CBS Merger. Advertising revenues accounted for 46% of the Companys consolidated revenues for 2002 and 2001 and 41% for 2000. Rental/retail sales for 2002 were up 9% in the video segment with rental sales growth of 3% and retail sales growth of 39%. Both rental and retail growth were driven by an increase in the number of company operated stores of 495 and by the continuing strength of DVD and game products. DVD rental revenues represented 39% of total rental revenues in 2002 compared with 19% in 2001, and 7% in 2000. Rental/retail sales for 2001 increased 4% from 2000 with a 4% increase in both rental revenue and retail revenue driven by an increase in the number of company operated stores of 158. DVD retail revenues more than doubled in 2002 from 2001 as a result of increased consumer demand. Retail revenues increased to 19% of total rental/retail revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with 15% in 2001 and 14% in 2000. The Company expects rental and retail DVD revenues to increase as a percentage of revenues in 2003 compared with 2002. Affiliate fees for 2002 increased 8% over 2001 driven by increases at MTVN, SNI and BET reflecting rate increases at each of the networks as well as an increase in subscriber volume at MTVNs digital channels. Affiliate fees for 2001 increased 20% over 2000 driven by increases at MTVN and SNI, and the acquisition of BET in January 2001. Growth in 2001 versus 2000 at MTVN was principally due to the acquisition of TNN and CMT as part of the Viacom/CBS Merger as well as increases in both rate per subscriber and subscriber volume; growth at SNI reflected increases in both cable and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") fees. Television license fee revenues increased 9% in 2002 primarily from increased syndication revenues from cable sales and additional syndication revenues from the launch of THE DR. PHIL SHOW in 2002. Television license fees decreased 11% in 2001 compared with 2000 due to lower distribution fees and the absence of revenues from canceled shows. Feature film revenues remained flat in 2002 versus 2001, and increased 9% in 2001 versus 2000 primarily from strong home video growth partially offset by lower theatrical revenues. II 5 Operating Expenses Operating expenses include the following major components: production expenses attributable to television programming and feature films which reflect the amortization of television and theatrical inventory costs including direct production costs, residuals and participation expenses, production overhead and acquisition costs, as well as costs attributable to radio programming expenses including on air talent and other production costs; program amortization expenses reflecting the amortization of costs incurred to acquire rights to programming exhibited on the broadcast networks, cable networks and broadcast stations; costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses including amortization of the costs of videocassette, DVD and game inventory, revenue sharing expenses on rental inventory, store employee compensation expenses and occupancy expenses; and distribution expenses reflecting advertising and other distribution costs including residuals and participation expenses, incurred primarily with respect to theatrical and television product. For the year ended December 31, 2002, operating expenses of $14.9 billion increased 3% over operating expenses for 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2001, operating expenses of $14.5 billion increased 24% over operating expenses for 2000. The changes in operating expenses were due to the following: Production and program amortization expenses for 2002 increased 4% versus 2001 driven by contractual increases in costs associated with series at the broadcast networks and increases at the Company owned television stations due to new entertainment and sports programming investments. Production and program amortization expenses for 2001 increased 26% versus 2000 primarily reflecting a full year of expenses for CBS Network and stations, as well as radio stations, versus eight months in 2000 effective from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger. The increase in 2001 was also driven by higher news production costs at the broadcast networks, increased expenses associated with higher syndication revenues, the change in mix of network series in 2001 compared with 2000, higher contractual rights fees associated with SUPER BOWL XXXV and increases for other sports properties at CBS Network. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2002 increased 1% versus 2001 reflecting a shift in product mix and the net increase in the number of company operated stores of 495, partially offset by the 2001 charge associated with Blockbusters re merchandising and store reconfiguration plans. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2001 increased 14% versus 2000 reflecting the increase in the number of company operated stores of 158 and the 2001 charge described above. Distribution expenses for 2002 increased 8% versus 2001 reflecting higher costs associated with prints and advertising due to the higher number of feature films partially offset by a decrease in other distribution costs. Distribution expenses for 2001 increased 13% versus 2000 reflecting higher print and advertising costs associated with a higher number of feature films in theatrical release during 2001. Other operating expenses for 2002 include outdoor advertising expenses, which increased 10% versus 2001 reflecting higher guarantee payments for transit contracts. Other operating expenses for outdoor increased significantly in 2001 versus 2000 as 2001 reflected twelve months of expenses for outdoor compared with eight months in 2000 and also reflected expenses for acquired outdoor properties. II 6 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, which include expenses incurred to provide back office support, occupancy, selling and marketing costs, and incentive compensation, increased 3% to $4.2 billion for 2002 from $4.1 billion in 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses of $4.1 billion remained unchanged with the prior year reflecting costs savings across several divisions offset by an increase associated with a full year of expenses in 2001 from the Viacom/CBS Merger. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus 18% for 2001 and 20% for 2000. Included within selling, general and administrative expenses are residual costs, which primarily include pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. Residual costs for 2002 versus 2001 decreased 22% to $67.8 million due primarily to the recognition of actuarial gains for benefit plans of certain divested businesses. Residual costs increased 13% in 2001 versus 2000 as 2001 reflected a full year of costs compared with eight months in 2000, from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger. In 2003, pension expense for the Companys pension plans, including plans associated with its divested businesses is expected to increase by approximately $100 million primarily due to decreases in pension plan asset values and the expected rate of return on such assets. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2002, depreciation and amortization decreased to $945.6 million as compared with $3.1 billion for 2001. The decrease was due to the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") effective January 1, 2002, and as a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. For the year ended December 31, 2001, depreciation and amortization expense increased to $3.1 billion as compared with $2.2 billion for 2000. This increase was primarily due to the full year of amortization of the goodwill attributable to the Viacom/CBS Merger versus eight months of this amortization in 2000, as well as the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the remaining interest in Infinity and the acquisition of BET in 2001. Total Expenses Total expenses, including depreciation and amortization, decreased 8% to $20.0 billion for 2002 versus $21.8 billion for 2001 principally reflecting a reduction in amortization expense associated with the adoption of SFAS 142 in 2002 and the charge recorded by Blockbuster in 2001. Total expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 16% to $21.8 billion for 2001 from $18.7 billion for 2000, reflecting increases associated with revenue growth and twelve months of expenses for the combined companies, including goodwill amortization, associated with the Viacom/CBS Merger versus eight months of expenses, including amortization, in 2000. Additionally, 2000 results reflected the Viacom/CBS Merger related charge of $698.5 million. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense decreased 12% to $848.3 million from $969.2 million for 2001 due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates partially offset by expenses recognized upon the early redemption of debt in 2001. The Company had approximately $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2001 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at weighted average interest rates of 6.6% and 6.8%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, interest expense increased to $969.2 million from $822.3 million for 2000. The increase principally reflected the full year impact of $3.7 billion of CBS debt assumed II 7 with the Viacom/CBS Merger as well as the Companys fixed rate debt issuances of $1.65 billion in January 2001, $1.4 billion in May 2001 and $335.0 million in June 2001. This was offset by lower interest rates on the Companys variable rate debt and as a result of debt maturities, redemptions and tenders. The Company had approximately $13.1 billion principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at December 31, 2000 at a weighted average interest rate of 7.6%. Interest Income For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest income decreased to $15.8 million from $30.6 million in 2001. Interest income in 2000 was $53.2 million. The decreases in interest income were due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in 2002 versus 2001, and in 2001 versus 2000. Other Items, Net For the year ended December 31, 2002, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $30.0 million which principally consisted of foreign exchange losses of $51.9 million, losses of $19.7 million associated with securitizing trade receivables and an aggregate loss of approximately $13.8 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value. These losses were partially offset by the recovery of advertising commitments of $29.8 million, a gain of $18.8 million on the sale of a telephone kiosk advertising business and a net gain of $5.5 million from the sale of investments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, "Other items, net" of $254.7 million principally reflected a gain from television station swaps of $210.1 million and the recovery of certain advertising commitments of $250.0 million offset by impairment losses of approximately $125.0 million related to the Companys investments. The one time pre tax gains were also partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $8.2 million and losses of $22.8 million associated with securitizing trade receivables. Additionally, 2001 reflects an impairment loss of $46.6 million related to the purchase of two television stations. The recovery of advertising commitments in 2002 and 2001 reflected the restructuring of agreements with several Internet companies. As a result, the Company was released from related advertising commitments and reversed related deferred revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2000, "Other items, net" of $8.8 million principally reflected foreign exchange gains of $31.7 million and net gains of approximately $44.3 million on the sale of assets which were principally offset by the write down of approximately $66.9 million of several Internet investments to their market value. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. For 2002, the annual effective tax rate was 38.8%, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting, versus 118.5% in 2001 and 130.2% in 2000. The annual 2001 and 2000 rates were adversely affected by non deductible goodwill amortization. Assuming SFAS 142 had been adopted, the annual effective tax rates would have been 36.8% for 2001 and 43.0% for 2000. Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $39.5 million for 2002, $127.0 million for 2001 and $124.2 million for 2000. The amounts principally reflected operating losses from international ventures and Internet investments partially offset by Comedy Centrals results. Additionally, 2001 reflected operating losses from Internet equity investments that were no longer operating in 2002. The 2000 amount included losses from online equity ventures as well as equity losses of UPN, partially offset by results from Comedy Central. The remaining 50% interest of UPN was acquired by the Company in March 2000, and its results have been consolidated with the Company since the date of acquisition. II 8 Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest for 2002 primarily reflected the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Minority interest for 2001 primarily represented the minority ownership of Infinity, prior to its merger with the Company on February 21, 2001, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Minority interest for 2000 principally reflected the minority ownership of Infinity, from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Extraordinary Loss, Net of Tax In 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 145 which required that gains or losses recognized upon the extinguishment of debt no longer be classified as extraordinary. The Company recognized an extraordinary loss of $3.9 million, net of tax benefit of $2.6 million, in 2001. This amount has been reclassified to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations to conform with this new accounting standard. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest and Tax Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142 and recorded an after tax non cash charge of $1.5 billion (net of minority interest of $336 million), or $.84 per basic and $.83 per diluted share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded an after tax non cash charge of $452.3 million, or $.37 per basic and diluted share, which resulted from the early adoption of SOP 00 2, "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films" ("SOP 00 2"). Net Earnings (Loss) The Company reported net earnings of $725.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared with a net loss of $223.5 million for 2001. The substantial improvement in net earnings reflected revenue growth principally from advertising sales and the reduction of amortization expense resulting from the implementation of SFAS 142. These increases were partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge of $1.5 billion recorded in 2002 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax. The Company reported a net loss of $816.1 million for 2000. 2001 reflected a full year of results for the combined company as a result of the Viacom/CBS Merger compared with eight months of results for 2000. Additionally, 2000 included a pre tax merger related charge of $698.5 million and an after tax non cash charge of $452.3 million from the adoption of SOP 00 2. II 9 Segment Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 The tables below present the Companys revenues and operating income by segment, as reported for each of the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues: Cable Networks $ 4,726.7 $ 4,297.6 $ 3,951.0 10 % 9 % Television 7,490.0 7,247.7 5,426.4 3 34 Infinity 3,754.6 3,670.2 2,764.7 2 33 Entertainment 3,646.9 3,597.8 3,351.7 1 7 Video 5,565.9 5,156.7 4,960.1 8 4 Eliminations (578.4 ) (747.2 ) (410.2 ) 23 (82 ) Total Revenues $ 24,605.7 $ 23,222.8 $ 20,043.7 6 % 16 % Operating Income: Cable Networks(a) $ 1,772.2 $ 1,234.9 $ 1,073.5 44 % 15 % Television(b) 1,202.4 402.1 351.0 199 15 Infinity 1,225.6 291.8 589.4 NM (50 ) Entertainment 333.5 199.0 259.3 68 (23 ) Video(c) 355.8 (219.6 ) 75.7 NM NM Segment Operating Income 4,889.5 1,908.2 2,348.9 156 (19 ) Corporate expenses (159.0 ) (169.1 ) (847.3 ) 6 80 Eliminations(d) (66.0 ) (191.7 ) (103.2 ) 66 (86 ) Residual costs(e) (67.8 ) (87.2 ) (77.5 ) 22 (13 ) Total Operating Income $ 4,596.7 $ 1,460.2 $ 1,320.9 215 % 11 % NM Not meaningful (a)2001 year reflects a fourth quarter charge of $75.4 million principally related to a restructuring plan at MTVN to reduce headcount and close certain international offices. (b)2001 year reflects a fourth quarter charge of $53.4 million related to the Companys plan to integrate UPN with CBS Network operations. (c)2001 year reflects a primarily non cash charge of $394.7 million in Video principally related to the elimination of less productive VHS tapes as part of the transition from VHS to the higher margin DVD rental market and a change in amortization. (d)Eliminations principally reflect the profit elimination of the sale of feature films to cable and broadcast networks and to the Video segment, and television programming sales to cable networks. (e)Primarily includes pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. 2001 operating income was affected by one time, primarily non cash charges in the Companys Cable Networks, Television and Video segments. Additionally, in 2002, SFAS 142 was adopted resulting in the elimination of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. A comparison of reported 2002 operating income with reported prior years operating income is less meaningful as a result of these items. Management believes adjusting prior years to reflect the impact of SFAS 142 as if it had been adopted on January 1, 2000 and excluding these non recurring charges, provides a more meaningful comparison of operating income and is more useful in analyzing the underlying historical segment results and future trends. II 10  The table below presents a reconciliation of reported operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to operating income adjusted for SFAS 142 and excluding charges as described below: Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Operating Income $ 4,596.7 $ 1,460.2 $ 1,320.9 SFAS 142 Adjustment 2,112.0 1,358.6 Charges: MTVN(a) 75.4 UPN(b) 53.4 Blockbuster(c) 394.7 Viacom/CBS Merger Related 698.5 Operating Income Adjusted for SFAS 142 and Excluding Charges $ 4,596.7 $ 4,095.7 $ 3,378.0 (a)Reflects restructuring charge of $66.6 million for severance as a result of a reduction in the workforce and lease termination costs and $8.8 million as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. (b)Reflects restructuring charge of $52.8 million in connection with the Companys plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations and $.6 million as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. (c)Reflects a primarily non cash charge in Video principally related to the elimination of less productive VHS tapes as part of the transition from VHS to the higher margin DVD rental market and a change in amortization. The table below presents the Companys operating income by segment as reported for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with 2001 and 2000 which are presented as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. Operating income for 2001 has also been adjusted to exclude the charges at MTVN, UPN and Blockbuster. Operating income for 2000 has been adjusted to exclude Viacom/CBS Merger related charges.

The Company believes that EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operating performance of its segments, and it is a primary measure used internally by management to manage the business. EBITDA is also a primary measure used externally by the Companys investors, analysts and peers in its industry. However, EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, operating income, net earnings, cash flows, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. As EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Please also see page II 10 of the Form 10 K where operating income is presented in accordance with GAAP.

("SNI"), owner of several Premium Subscription Television Program Services) (Contributed 19% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, and 20% for the year ended December 31, 2000). Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 4,726.7 $ 4,297.6 $ 3,951.0 10 % 9 % Operating income (OI) $ 1,772.2 $ 1,234.9 $ 1,073.5 44 % 15 % OI as a % of revenues 37% 29% 27% OI Adjusted(a) $ 1,772.2 $ 1,541.0 $ 1,196.5 15 % 29 % OI Adjusted as a % of revenues 37% 36% 30% EBITDA $ 1,963.1 $ 1,682.0 $ 1,373.3 17 % 22 % (a)2002 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has not been adjusted. 2001 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back (i) amortization expense of $230.7 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000, and (ii) the MTVN charge of $75.4 million related to its 2001 restructuring plan. 2000 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back amortization expense of $123.0 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% principally driven by 12% growth in advertising revenues and an 8% increase in affiliate fees. Approximately 9% of Cable Networks revenues were generated from international regions, with approximately 70% of this total from Europe. Advertising revenue increases reflected 11% growth at MTVN due to selling more units, partially offset by a reduction in average unit rates. MTVNs advertising revenue growth was adversely impacted by the airing of units to satisfy audience deficiency liabilities incurred at VH1. BET delivered 17% advertising revenue growth for 2002 over the prior year, benefiting from higher average rates, slightly offset by reduced paid programming revenues. BETs results for 2002 included three additional weeks versus 2001, due to the January 23, 2001 closing of the BET acquisition. Cable affiliate fees increased 8% principally due to mid single digit rate increases at MTVNs domestic channels, excluding digital, and an 18% increase in domestic subscribers principally due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Noggin and the expansion of MTVN digital channels. Also contributing to the increase in cable affiliate fees was a mid single digit increase in average rates for Showtime and The Movie Channel. Other ancillary revenues for Cable Networks were principally comprised of consumer products licensing revenues from Nickelodeon and represented approximately 8% of revenues for each year. For 2002, Cable Networks operating income increased 44% reflecting the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and the impact of the MTVN charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001. The MTVN charge reflected $66.6 million for severance due to a reduction in workforce and for lease termination costs. In conjunction with the restructuring, $8.8 million was recorded as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. Assuming operating income was adjusted for SFAS 142 and excluding the charge, operating income would have increased 15% in 2002 reflecting higher revenues partially offset by higher operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses, principally comprised of programming and production costs for the cable channels, increased 7%, driven by higher programming costs at MTV, Nickelodeon, TNN and SNI. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. Selling, general and II 13 administrative expenses excluding the restructuring charge, increased 10% primarily due to higher compensation expense from sales commissions as a result of revenue growth. Capital expenditures for Cable Networks were $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. 2001 vs. 2000 Cable Networks revenue and operating income growth was principally driven by revenue growth in cable and DBS affiliate fees and increased efficiencies in 2001. MTVNs advertising revenues decreased 4% due to softness in the advertising market which contributed to a decline in the number of advertising spots sold at MTV, VH1 and TV Land. Effective cost containment measures at the channels, as well as a reduction of investment in online services during 2001 contributed to the operating income growth. The acquisitions of BET in January 2001 and CMT and TNN in May 2000 as a result of the Viacom/CBS Merger contributed to the overall increase in advertising revenues of 6% and affiliate fee revenues of 20% for Cable Networks. Showtime subscriptions increased 10% over the prior year by approximately 2.9 million to 31.3 million subscriptions at December 31, 2001. Capital expenditures for Cable Networks were $139.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $158.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company completed its acquisition of BET on January 23, 2001 for approximately $3 billion consisting principally of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption of debt. Television (CBS and UPN Television Networks, Television Stations; Television Production and Syndication) (Contributed 30% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, 31% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 27% for the year ended December 31, 2000). Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 7,490.0 $ 7,247.7 $ 5,426.4 3 % 34 % Operating income (OI) $ 1,202.4 $ 402.1 $ 351.0 199 % 15 % OI as a % of revenues 16% 6% 6% OI Adjusted(a) $ 1,202.4 $ 1,100.4 $ 849.8 9 % 29 % OI Adjusted as a % of revenues 16% 15% 16% EBITDA $ 1,343.2 $ 1,188.5 $ 919.1 13 % 29 % NM Not meaningful (a)2002 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has not been adjusted. 2001 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back (i) amortization expense of $644.9 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000, and (ii) the UPN charge of $53.4 million related to the 2001 plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations. 2000 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back (i) amortization expense of $450.3 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000, and (ii) $48.5 million of the Viacom/CBS Merger related charge associated with the acquisition of UPN in 2000. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Television revenues increased 3% principally driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, partially offset by lower syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 2%, with 9% growth for both CBS and UPN in primetime due to 5% average rate increases, partially offset by rate decreases in daytime and news dayparts. CBS Network had additional units available for sale in 2002 versus the prior year when there were fewer units available as a result of the events of September 11 during which CBS ran sustaining news II 14 coverage from September 11 through September 14, 2001. CBS Network sold approximately 85% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2002 2003 season versus 65% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2001 2002 season. The revenue increases were partially offset by the absence of the Super Bowl, which CBS televised in 2001. The Stations group delivered 12% year over year advertising revenue growth led by increased political ads and higher sales in the automotive and services industries. The acquisition of KCAL TV Los Angeles in May 2002 contributed 5% of the Stations group revenue growth for the year. In 2003, protracted coverage of a prolonged war could have an adverse effect on Televisions revenues and expenses. For 2002, Television revenues also reflected a decrease in domestic and foreign syndication revenues and lower network revenues, partially offset by higher home video revenues. Domestic syndication revenues included revenues from the initial availability to cable of 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED, SISTER, SISTER, and ANY DAY NOW as well as higher library revenues from THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW and HAPPY DAYS. However, these revenues did not match the absence of contributions from the syndication of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and CHEERS in the prior year and license fees from cancelled series including STAR TREK: VOYAGER, DR. LAURA and REAL TV. Foreign syndication revenues were lower primarily resulting from lower current series revenues partially offset by higher revenues from library product. Network revenues decreased as revenues from new series in the 2002/2003 season were more than offset by the absence of revenues from canceled series. Home video revenues were higher primarily from the DVD release of seasons 1 through 7 of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. For 2002, Television operating income increased to $1.2 billion from $402.1 million reflecting the impacts of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations. Assuming operating income was adjusted for SFAS 142 and excluding the charge, operating income would have increased 9% in 2002 reflecting higher revenues partially offset by higher operating and general and administrative expenses. Production and programming expenses at the broadcast networks increased slightly by 1.5% for the year, principally reflecting higher costs in primetime due to contractual series increases and higher sports rights offset by lower NFL costs due to the absence of the Super Bowl in 2002. The Stations group incurred higher costs for syndicated programming and sports rights. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. Capital expenditures for Television were $138.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $380.9 million and $460.1 million, respectively. 2001 vs. 2000 For 2001, CBS and UPN Networks combined revenues and operating income growth of 63% and 99%, respectively, was principally driven by 71% higher advertising revenues, as comparisons with 2000 included only eight months of results from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger versus twelve months of results in 2001. Additionally, CBS Network advertising revenue increases were led by growth in primetime principally due to rate increases. UPNs higher advertising revenues in 2001 benefited from ratings improvements. Assuming the Viacom/CBS Merger occurred at the beginning of 2000, CBS Enterprises revenues decreased for the year principally due to lower distribution fees received from THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW and the absence of revenues from canceled shows, including THE ROSEANNE SHOW and MARTIN SHORT, partially offset by the domestic syndication of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. II 15 Television benefited from network revenues from the new series ENTERPRISE, higher revenues from continuing network and first run syndication shows including FRASIER, JAG, JUDGE JUDY, JUDGE JOE BROWN and ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT and the licensing to basic cable of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and CHEERS. These higher revenues were partially offset by the absence of revenues from the canceled series BEVERLY HILLS 90210 and SUNSET BEACH, and lower revenues from SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH and MOESHA whose prior year revenues included first time syndication availabilities. The revenue and operating income growth at the broadcast networks and in syndication was partially impacted by the events of September 11. CBS Network also recorded higher news production costs as well as contractual rights fee increases for sports properties. Capital expenditures for Television were $120.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $116.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Infinity (Radio Stations and Outdoor Advertising Properties) (Contributed 15% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, 16% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 14% for the year ended December 31, 2000). Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 3,754.6 $ 3,670.2 $ 2,764.7 2% 33 % Operating income (OI) $ 1,225.6 $ 291.8 $ 589.4 NM (50) % OI as a % of revenues 33% 8% 21% OI Adjusted(a) $ 1,225.6 $ 1,288.5 $ 1,133.1 (5)% 14 % OI Adjusted as a % of revenues 33% 35% 41% EBITDA $ 1,462.0 $ 1,517.7 $ 1,282.6 (4)% 18 % NM Not meaningful (a)2002 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has not been adjusted. 2001 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back amortization expense of $996.7 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. 2000 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back amortization expense of $543.7 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Infinity revenues increased 2%, led by advertising revenue growth in the radio markets. Approximately 18% of Infinitys revenues were generated from international regions, with approximately 77% of this total from Europe. Radio revenues increased 5% due to an increase in spots sold for the year, with average spot rates increasing slightly. Radio revenues included consideration for management services provided to Westwood One radio network, an affiliated company. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. For 2002, Outdoor revenues decreased 1% due to weakness in the outdoor advertising market during the first half of 2002. Geopolitical events, including war or terrorism, could have an adverse effect on Infinitys advertising revenues. For 2002, Infinity operating income increased to $1.2 billion from $291.8 million reflecting the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Assuming operating income was adjusted for SFAS 142, operating income would have decreased 5% in 2002 reflecting incremental expenses associated with acquired sports rights and higher guarantee payments on outdoor transit contracts. Capital expenditures for Infinity were $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $99.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. II 16 2001 vs. 2000 For 2001, Infinity revenues increased 33%, with advertising revenues increasing 30%, as comparisons with 2000 included only eight months of results from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger versus twelve months of results in 2001. In 2001, approximately 18% of Infinitys revenues were generated from international regions, with approximately 75% of this total from Europe. Assuming the Viacom/CBS Merger occurred January 1, 2000, Infinity revenues would have decreased 5% with lower revenues in both the radio and outdoor advertising businesses due to the softness in the advertising market with lower demand from the technology sector. Infinitys outdoor transit business was affected by lower pricing, particularly in the New York market, which suffered more than other markets after the events of September 11. Operating income decreased reflecting the impact of twelve months of amortization of goodwill in 2001 associated with the Viacom/CBS Merger and the incremental amortization of goodwill from the acquisition of the remaining minority interest of Infinity. On February 21, 2001, the Company completed its merger with Infinity, acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock that it did not already own, or approximately 36%, for a total purchase price of approximately $13.4 billion. Capital expenditures for the Infinity segment were $99.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $72.0 million for the period ended December 31, 2000, reflecting expenditures from the date of the Viacom/CBS Merger. Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; Consumer Publishing, as well as the operation of Theme Parks, Movie Theaters and Music Publishing) (Contributed 15% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001 and 17% for the year ended December 31, 2000). Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 3,646.9 $ 3,597.8 $ 3,351.7 1 % 7 % Operating income (OI) $ 333.5 $ 199.0 $ 259.3 68 % (23) % OI as a % of revenues 9% 6% 8% OI Adjusted (a) $ 333.5 $ 263.3 $ 322.6 27 % (18) % OI Adjusted as a % of revenues 9% 7% 10% EBITDA $ 454.2 $ 381.8 $ 440.1 19 % (13) % (a)2002 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has not been adjusted. 2001 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back amortization expense of $64.3 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. 2000 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back amortization expense of $63.3 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Entertainment revenues increased 1% compared with the same prior year period principally reflecting higher Publishing, Theaters and Features revenues, which were partially offset by lower Parks revenues. Approximately 33% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were slightly higher mainly due to higher network television, domestic home video, domestic syndication and pay television revenues, which were partially offset by lower worldwide theatrical, foreign syndication, foreign pay television and foreign home video revenues. Domestic theatrical revenues primarily included contributions from the theatrical release of THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, WE WERE SOLDIERS, JACKASS THE MOVIE, CHANGING LANES and STAR TREK NEMESIS. Worldwide home video revenues were higher than last years revenues including contributions from VANILLA SKY, II 17 JIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS and WE WERE SOLDIERS. Worldwide home video revenues included increases from the growth in demand for current releases and library titles in the DVD format and an overall decline in the demand for the VHS format. Theaters revenues increased due to higher average admission prices, higher attendance and increased per capita concession spending. Attendance in 2002 increased 3% compared with the prior year. Average admission prices and per capita concession spending both increased 5% over the prior year. Publishing revenues increased 4% primarily due to income from new distribution agreements and higher sales in the Adult Group and Childrens Book and Audio Divisions. The Adult Groups top selling titles for 2002 included "FROM A BUICK 8" by Stephen King, "SELF MATTERS" by Phillip C. McGraw and "EVERYTHINGS EVENTUAL" also by Stephen King, while top selling titles in the Childrens Division included "AMERICA" by Lynne Cheney and Robert Sadubas "THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS". For 2002, Entertainments operating income increased 68% reflecting the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Assuming SFAS 142 had been adopted in 2001, operating income would have increased 27% in 2002 principally reflecting growth from Features and Theaters. Features benefited from lower development and overhead costs. Theaters results reflected higher revenues and lower depreciation expense. Capital expenditures for Entertainment were $74.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $54.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. License fees for television exhibition of completed motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $948.1 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. 2001 vs. 2000 For 2001, Entertainments revenues increased 7% principally due to higher Features, Theaters and Publishing revenues. In 2001, approximately 34% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues increased 9% led by higher worldwide home video and Pay TV, as well as higher domestic theatrical revenues, partially offset by lower foreign theatrical revenues. Home video revenues in 2001 included domestic contributions from the release of THE GODFATHER DVD COLLECTION, LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER, WHAT WOMEN WANT and RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE, along with contributions from the foreign video release of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II. Domestic theatrical revenues in 2001 included contributions from LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER, SAVE THE LAST DANCE, WHAT WOMEN WANT, ALONG CAME A SPIDER, THE SCORE and VANILLA SKY. Theaters revenues increased 7% primarily as a result of higher attendance and increased admission prices and per capita concession spending. Attendance for the year increased 2% compared with 2000. Average admission prices increased 5.9% and average per capita concession spending increased 3.2% over the prior year. Publishing revenues increased 9% reflecting increases in each of its major operating units: Adult, Childrens, and New Media. The Adult Groups top selling titles in 2001 included "JOHN ADAMS" by David McCullough, "DREAMCATCHER" by Stephen King, "ON THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE" by Mary Higgins Clark and "SELF MATTERS" by Phillip C. McGraw. Top Childrens titles were "OLIVIA" and "OLIVIA SAVES THE CIRCUS" by Ian Falconer. For 2001, Entertainments operating income decreased 23% principally reflecting the revenue items noted above, which was more than offset by increased print and advertising costs associated with a higher number of pictures in theatrical release during 2001. Theaters operating income increased due to higher revenues and lower depreciation expense. Publishing revenues increase were offset by startup investment costs associated with transitioning information and technology support to a new third party provider and higher operating expenses. Capital expenditures for Entertainment were $54.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 versus $93.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. II 18  Video (Home videocassette, DVD and video game rental and retail operations) (Contributed 23% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, 22% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 25% for the year ended December 31, 2000). Percent Better/(Worse) Year Ended December 31, 2002 vs. 2001 2001 vs. 2000 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $ 5,565.9 $ 5,156.7 $ 4,960.1 8 % 4 % Operating income (OI) $ 355.8 $ (219.6 ) $ 75.7 NM NM OI as a % of revenues 6% NM 2% OI Adjusted(a) $ 355.8 $ 350.5 $ 254.0 2 % 38 % OI Adjusted as a % of revenues 6% 7% 5% EBITDA $ 589.6 $ 204.1 $ 534.8 189 % (62 )% NM Not meaningful (a)2002 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has not been adjusted. 2001 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back (i) amortization expense of $175.4 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000, and (ii) the charge of $394.7 million principally related to the elimination of less productive VHS tapes as part of the transition from VHS to the higher margin DVD rental market and change in amortization. 2000 operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP has been adjusted to add back amortization expense of $178.3 million, as if SFAS 142 had been adopted January 1, 2000. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Video revenues increased 8% to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion principally driven by an increase of 5.1% in worldwide same store revenues and a net increase of 495 in the number of company operated stores from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. Domestic revenues increased 6% while international revenues increased 13%. International revenues represented approximately 21% of Video revenues, with approximately 55% from Europe and 23% from Canada. Worldwide same store revenues, which includes rental and retail product, increased 5.1% primarily resulting from 32.6% growth in same store retail revenues, and 0.9% growth in same store rental revenues over the prior year. Domestic and international same store revenues increased 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Blockbusters rental revenues are generated from the rental of VHS tapes, DVDs, video games and from any eventual sale of previously rented VHS tapes, DVDs and video games. Revenues generated from rental transactions include revenues received in connection with the initial rentals of product, as well as revenues received in connection with any continuation of such rentals past the initial rental period, as contemplated by Blockbusters membership agreement. For 2002, Video operating income increased to $355.8 million from a loss of $219.6 million reflecting the impact of the adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and the charge taken in 2001. Assuming operating income was adjusted for SFAS 142 and excluding the charge described in the footnote above, operating income would have increased 2%. Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for lease obligations related to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in January 2003. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these lease guarantees. The Company has accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations and the $18.7 million had no impact on the Companys operating results for 2002. During the second half of 2002, Blockbuster continued its focus on the sale of new movies and games as a complement to its rental offering in order to accommodate increased demand for retail product. As a result of this increased focus, Blockbuster continued to expand the selection in its stores for DVD and games hardware and software. Blockbuster also continued to take advantage of its ability to offer promotions that combine film rentals with sales of popular retail titles, thereby providing an alternative to the offerings that can be provided by a traditional retailer. Blockbuster expects these types of promotions, II 19 as well as customer traffic generated by its rental business, to continue to drive increased retail sales. While much of the retail product is returnable to vendors, the increased investment in inventory necessary to capitalize on these initiatives increases Blockbusters exposure to excess inventories in the event anticipated sales fail to materialize. Blockbuster experienced some softness in its business during December 2002 which could be attributable primarily to aggressive price competition from mass market retailers. Blockbuster ended 2002 with 8,545 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 495 company operated stores and 69 franchise stores over December 31, 2001. Capital expenditures for Video were $140.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 versus $93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily due to new store openings and expenditures related to Blockbusters retail initiatives during 2002. Viacom currently owns approximately 80.4% of Blockbuster (NYSE: BBI). 2001 vs. 2000 For 2001, Video revenues increased 4% driven by higher worldwide same store sales and an increase in the number of company operated stores of 158. Domestic revenues increased 3% while international revenues, which represented approximately 20% of Videos revenues, increased 8%. Worldwide same store revenues, which include rental and retail products, increased 2.5%, driven by international same store sales up 12.6% as a result of copy depth programs in key international markets and the growth in DVD revenues. Worldwide same store rental revenues increased 2.1%, with domestic same store rental revenues increasing 0.5% and international same store rental revenues increasing by 10.7%. Videos operating income for 2001 decreased as a result of the 2001 charge recorded in the third and fourth quarters, principally related to the elimination of less productive VHS tapes as part of the transition from VHS to the higher margin DVD rental market and a change in amortization. Blockbuster experienced an improvement in profit margins primarily due to an increase in the percentage of rental revenues from DVDs which, on average, have a lower cost than VHS rental products, an increase in margins on domestic game rentals, and an increase in margins on previously rented products which on average sell at a higher average unit selling price because of higher DVD mix. For the year, compensation and occupancy costs increased principally driven by store growth and increased customer service initiatives. Capital expenditures for Blockbuster were $93.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared with $212.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Blockbuster ended 2001 with 7,981 company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 158 company operated and 146 franchise stores over 2000. Restructuring, Blockbuster and Merger Related Charges Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of 2001, MTV Networks announced a restructuring plan to reduce headcount in its domestic and foreign offices and close certain offices in Latin America, Europe and Asia. Having met the conditions required by EITF Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity" ("EITF 94 3"), the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $66.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $8.8 million in depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2001. Included in the restructuring charge was severance of $58.3 million for the termination of 449 domestic staff employees, 26 information systems employees and 151 employees in Latin America, Europe and Asia across various levels and departments including sales and marketing, production, development, finance, online and creative services. The reserve also included lease termination and other occupancy costs of $8.3 million for vacated office space in New York. During 2002, an incremental $8.3 million was accrued as additional lease termination costs based on a revision to the initial estimate. As of December 31, 2002, all employees under the plan were terminated and the Company had paid and charged $47.1 million against the severance liability of which $11.4 million was paid and charged during 2001. As of December 31, 2002, $9.5 million was paid and charged against the lease termination liability; no payments were made against this liability in 2001. Severance and lease payments will continue into 2003 since certain employees will be paid out over the terms of their II 20 employment contracts and lease payments will continue to be paid in accordance with the terms of the lease. In the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with the Companys plan to integrate UPN with CBS Network operations and, having met the conditions required by EITF 94 3, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $52.8 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $.6 million in depreciation and amortization. The restructuring charge included programming write offs of $29.6 million and approximately $15.0 million of employee related costs, including severance, for the termination of 38 employees across various levels and departments including corporate, finance and administration, sales and marketing and affiliate relations. The reserve also included lease termination and other costs of $8.2 million for vacated space at three of UPNs offices. The integration of UPN with CBS Network operations began in January 2002 and was completed by the end of the year. During 2002, a $5.4 million revision to initial estimates resulted in a reduction in lease termination and other costs and an increase in programming write offs. Additionally, as of December 31, 2002, $3.0 million of severance liabilities was reversed due to a change in estimate. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had paid and charged approximately $11.3 million against the severance liability associated with the termination of the employees and $1.2 million against the lease termination and other costs. There were no payments charged against the reserve in 2001. Severance payments will continue into 2003 since certain employees will be paid out over the terms of their employment contracts. Blockbuster Charge During the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster began implementation of a strategic re merchandising plan to allow for an expansion of store space for DVD and other strategic product offerings, which it completed by December 31, 2001. In connection with its plan, Blockbuster disposed of approximately 30% of its rental VHS library in its stores, certain VHS merchandise inventory primarily located in its distribution center and certain games from its rental library in its stores. The net book value of the eliminated inventory, net of proceeds, resulted in a primarily non cash charge of approximately $195.9 million to operating expenses in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Blockbuster also recorded a charge of approximately $26.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to employee, labor and supply and disposal costs to execute the plan. Additionally, $2.6 million was charged to depreciation expense for the write off of fixed assets and $1.9 million was charged below operating income to equity in loss of affiliated companies for the adoption of a similar re merchandising plan at one of Blockbusters joint venture operations. The plan was completed by the end of 2001 through the destruction or sale of the identified items. Also, during the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster recorded approximately $27.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to two lawsuits. The amounts described above, and including the $141.7 million recorded as the change in accounting estimates for rental inventory, represented the 2001 pre tax charge of approximately $396.6 million. Merger Related Charge In the second quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a non recurring merger related charge of $698.5 million ($504.5 million after tax or $.41 per share), associated with the integration of Viacom and CBS and the acquisition of UPN. This amount included a non cash charge of $415.5 million principally attributable to compensation for stock options and $283.0 million of cash payments and accrued liabilities for severance, transaction fees and integration costs. During 2002, a $9.0 million revision to initial estimates resulted in a reduction of liabilities for transaction fees and an increase to severance and integration liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company paid and charged approximately $14.7 million for severance liabilities, $15.6 million for integration costs and the remaining liabilities for transaction fees of $14.1 million were released. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company paid and charged $17.0 million for severance liabilities, $0.4 million for transaction fees and $63.0 million for integration costs. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company paid and charged $92.1 million for severance liabilities, $26.5 million for transaction fees and $6.0 million for integration costs. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately $33.6 million remaining for severance and integration costs and the Company expects to substantially use these reserves by the end of 2003. II 21 Financial Position Current assets increased to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2002 from $6.8 billion at December 31, 2001 primarily due to an increase of $414.0 million in current inventory and an increase of $139.2 million in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease of $96.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in current inventory reflects an additional $249.2 million investment in merchandise inventory to support Blockbusters initiatives to increase its share of the retail VHS and DVD market. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 7.0% at December 31, 2002 compared with 7.1% at December 31, 2001. Net property and equipment decreased $222.5 million to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2002 from $6.3 billion at December 31, 2001 primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $843.9 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $537.1 million principally for outdoor advertising structures, video stores, construction of new park rides, and broadcasting equipment. Non current inventory increased $191.4 million to $4.5 billion at December 31, 2002 from $4.3 billion at December 31, 2001 primarily due to an increase in program rights and rental inventory. Goodwill of $57.1 billion decreased from $59.1 billion at December 31, 2001, reflecting the write off of goodwill related to Blockbuster as a result of the implementation of SFAS 142. Intangibles increased $601.5 million to $12.5 billion at December 31, 2002 from $11.9 billion at December 31, 2001, primarily reflecting the addition of FCC licenses with the acquisition of KCAL TV in May 2002. Current liabilities decreased to $7.3 billion at December 31, 2002 from $7.6 billion at December 31, 2001 primarily due to reductions of $342.6 million in accrued participations, largely offset by an increase of $231.2 million in accounts payable. Total debt, including current maturities, decreased $718.5 million to $10.4 billion at December 31, 2002 principally reflecting the use of cash from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Minority interest of $845.2 million at December 31, 2002 decreased $366.6 million from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2001 reflecting the impact on minority owners from the implementation of SFAS 142 and the acquisition of the minority interest in the Companys online music business. Cash Flows Operating Activities. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected net earnings of $725.7 million adjusted for non cash charges of $1.5 billion for the adoption of SFAS 142 and depreciation and amortization of $945.6 million. Additionally, operating cash flow benefited from the utilization of deferred tax assets of $655 million and from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $210 million. These increases were partially offset by an additional investment in Blockbusters merchandise and rental inventory and increased program rights for television series and sports. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected a net loss of $223.5 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense of $3.1 billion, and for the 2001 Blockbuster, MTVN and UPN charges plus decreases in accounts receivable, partially offset by payments of accrued expenses and accounts payable. Cash paid for income taxes of $630.1 million for 2002 were favorably impacted by the settlement of federal income tax audits and the recognition of tax benefits associated with non recurring items. Cash income taxes for 2003 will be higher due to expected higher operating income and the absence of the 2002 non recurring items and are expected to be in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Investing Activities. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected capital expenditures of $537.1 million, additional investments of $60.8 million in affiliated companies and acquisitions of $926.0 million primarily reflecting the acquisition of KCAL TV and the remaining interest in Noggin that the Company did not already own. Activity in 2002 also reflected Blockbusters acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in an Italy joint venture and the acquisition of a games retailer in the United Kingdom. During 2002, the Company acquired shares of Blockbusters Class A common stock for $11.2 million to maintain its ownership position at no less than II 22 80% for tax consolidation purposes. This purchase of subsidiary stock was reflected as part of acquisitions. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets of $72.2 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected the acquisitions of BET and outdoor businesses and capital expenditures of $515.4 million partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of radio stations and other assets. Financing Activities. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.0 billion, the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $1.2 billion, and the purchase of shares of Company stock for $1.1 billion. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.3 billion and from the exercise of stock employee options of $357.6 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflected $1.6 billion net repayment of debt and $1.1 billion used to purchase Company stock, partially offset by proceeds of $184.6 million from the exercise of employee stock options. Stock Purchase Program During 2002, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 27.8 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.2 billion under its stock purchase programs, of which $350.7 million was spent in the fourth quarter for 8.1 million shares. As of December 31, 2002, there was approximately $2.9 billion remaining under the current $3.0 billion purchase program. From January 1, through March 10, 2003, the Company purchased an additional 1.8 million shares for approximately $75.4 million. Acquisitions On May 15, 2002, the Company acquired the assets of KCAL TV Los Angeles for approximately $650 million. During 2002, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% interest in Noggin, the 24 hour digital network for kids that it did not already own for approximately $100 million. Blockbuster acquired the 51% interest that it did not already own in a joint venture in Italy and also acquired a games retailer in the United Kingdom for approximately $82.4 million in the aggregate in 2002. In November 2001, the Company completed the television station swaps of WDCA TV Washington D.C. and KTXH TV Houston in exchange for KBHK TV San Francisco. As a result of the swaps, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $210.1 million in "Other items, net". On February 21, 2001, the Company completed a merger with Infinity, acquiring all of the issued and outstanding shares of Infinity common stock that it did not already own, approximately 36%. Under the terms of the merger, which was tax free for the stockholders of Infinity and Viacom, each issued and outstanding share of Infinity Class A common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.592 of a share of Viacom Class B Common Stock. The Infinity merger was accounted for at historical cost, with the exception of minority interest, which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price of approximately $13.4 billion represented the issuance of approximately 231.6 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the fair value of Infinity stock options assumed by the Company. Infinity stockholders received a cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares. The goodwill attributable to this transaction was approximately $7.7 billion. On January 23, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of BET for approximately $3 billion, which principally represented the net issuance of approximately 43.0 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and the assumption by the Company of approximately $590 million in debt. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. An allocation of the total cost to acquire BET was based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of the acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of II 23 approximately $2.9 billion was allocated to intangibles. As of the acquisition date, BETs results are included as part of the Cable Networks segment. On May 4, 2000, CBS was merged with and into the Company. The total purchase price of approximately $39.8 billion included approximately $37.7 billion for the issuance of 825.5 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and 11,004 shares of Viacom Series C convertible preferred stock, which were subsequently converted into 11.0 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock, and approximately $1.9 billion for the fair value of CBS stock options assumed by the Company and transaction costs. In addition, Viacom assumed approximately $3.7 billion of CBS debt. Capital Structure At December 31, 2002 2001 Notes payable to banks $ 423.7 $ 645.0 Commercial paper 174.6 1,104.3 Senior debt 9,530.7 9,187.5 Senior subordinated debt 56.1 50.8 Subordinated exchange debentures 19.8 Other notes 28.6 16.2 Obligations under capital leases 392.2 452.0 Total Debt 10,605.9 11,475.6 Less current portion 199.0 299.0 Less discontinued operations debt (a) 201.7 352.9 Total Long Term Debt $ 10,205.2 $ 10,823.7 (a)Included in "Other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. Total debt of $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2001 were 14.5% and 15.5%, respectively, as a percentage of total capitalization of the Company. The senior, senior subordinated, and subordinated debt of each of Viacom Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Viacom International Inc., is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Viacom International Inc. and Viacom Inc., respectively. The senior debt and senior subordinated debt of the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries, CBS Broadcasting Inc. and Go Outdoor Systems Holdings S.A., respectively, are not guaranteed; the aggregate outstanding amount of such debt at December 31, 2002 was $108.3 million. The Companys total debt presented above includes, for the period ending December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively, (i) an aggregate unamortized premium of $49.5 million and $49.4 million and (ii) the change in the carrying value of the debt relating to fair value swaps of $86.2 million and $2.8 million. II 24 For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the following debt issuances, maturities and redemptions occurred: Debt Issuances August 28, 2002, $600.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2012 April 25, 2002, $700.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2007 June 29, 2001, $335.0 million 7.25% senior notes due 2051 May 17, 2001, $400.0 million 6.40% senior notes due 2006 May 17, 2001, $1.0 billion 6.625% senior notes due 2011 January 17, 2001, $400.0 million 6.40% senior notes due 2006 January 17, 2001, $500.0 million 7.70% senior notes due 2010 January 17, 2001, $750.0 million 7.875% senior debentures due 2030 Interest on all of the above notes is paid semi annually except for the 7.25% senior notes which is paid quarterly. Debt Maturities June 15, 2002, 8.375% notes, $321.8 million January 15, 2002, 7.50% senior notes, $250.0 million January 1, 2002, 7.625% senior notes, $143.0 million September 15, 2001, 10.25% senior subordinated notes, $35.3 million June 1, 2001, 8.875% notes, $230.0 million Debt Redemptions August 1, 2002, $239.5 million 8.25% senior debentures due 2022 at 103.5% of principal June 15, 2002, $2.6 million 8.875% senior subordinated notes due 2007 at 104.4% of principal June 1, 2002, $31.1 million 8.875% senior debentures due 2022 at 104.1% of principal January 15, 2002, $18.7 million 11.375% subordinated exchange debentures due 2009 at 105.7% of principal February 1, 2001, $60.3 million 9.00% senior subordinated notes due 2006 at 104.5% of principal October 15, 2001, $151.5 million 9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2006 at 104.7% of principal For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company repurchased approximately $55.0 million and $427.7 million of its debt, respectively. The Companys scheduled maturities of long term debt at face value, excluding commercial paper and capital leases, outstanding at December 31, 2002 are as follows: Year of Maturity 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 & thereafter Long term debt $ 874.8 $ 176.6 $ 1,473.2 $ 801.4 $ 700.1 $ 5,874.3 II 25 Viacom Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2002, the Companys credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, totaled $4.75 billion comprised of $1.45 billion and $1.5 billion 5 year revolving credit facilities and a $1.8 billion 364 day revolving credit facility. The $1.45 billion and $1.5 billion facilities are scheduled to expire in 2005 and 2006, respectively. On February 28, 2003, the Company entered into a $1.7 billion 364 day credit facility to replace the $1.8 billion facility which was to expire in March 2003. The terms and conditions of the $1.7 billion facility are substantially similar to the $1.8 billion facility. As of February 28, 2003, the Companys credit facilities total $4.65 billion. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the $1.5 billion facility. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined at the Companys option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Companys senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.51 billion in the aggregate. The facilities contain certain covenants, which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants. The primary purpose of the credit facilities is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2002, the Company had commercial paper borrowings of $174.6 million under its $4.75 billion commercial paper program. The Companys credit facilities supporting the commercial paper borrowings totaled $4.65 billion at February 28, 2003. Borrowings under the program have maturities of less than a year. At December 31, 2002, the Company had classified approximately $939.6 million of commercial paper and other debt scheduled to mature within the next twelve months as long term debt, reflecting its intent and ability, through the existence of unused revolving credit facilities, to refinance this debt on a long term basis. Blockbuster Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2002, Blockbusters credit agreement (the "Blockbuster Credit Agreement") was comprised of a $600.0 million long term revolver due July 1, 2004 and a $410.0 million term loan due in quarterly installments ending July 1, 2004. Blockbuster had $600.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the long term revolver at December 31, 2002. Blockbuster has the ability with this available borrowing capacity to extend the maturities of the current portion of the term loan. Interest rates under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement are based on the prime rate in the United States or LIBOR (plus a margin, or "LIBOR spread," based on leverage ratios, which is currently 1.25%) at Blockbusters option at the time of borrowing. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2002 for borrowings under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement was 3.1%. A variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver (0.25% at December 31, 2002). The Blockbuster Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment of dividends, purchase of Blockbusters common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2002, Blockbuster was in compliance with all covenants under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement. Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs As of December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001, the Company had an aggregate of $981.9 million and $950.0 million, respectively, outstanding under revolving receivable securitization programs. The programs result in the sale of receivables on a non recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable and debt on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these arrangements because they provide a cost efficient form of financing and an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from the programs were used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The Company is required to maintain certain ratios in connection with the programs. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization programs. II 26  Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes that its operating cash flow ($3.1 billion in 2002), cash and cash equivalents ($631.4 million at December 31, 2002), borrowing capacity under committed bank facilities (which consisted of unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.51 billion in the aggregate at December 31, 2002), and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, including commitments and contingencies, capital and investing commitments and its financing requirements for the foreseeable future. The funding for commitments to purchase sports programming rights, television and film operations, and talent contracts will come primarily from cash flow from operations. The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include capital expenditures, share purchases, acquisitions, and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activity available to meet these needs. Any net cash funding requirements are financed with short term borrowings (primarily commercial paper) and long term debt. Commercial paper borrowings, which also accommodate day to day changes in funding requirements, are backed by committed bank facilities that may be utilized in the event that commercial paper borrowings are not available. The Companys strong credit position, which is reflected by an A /A3 rating, affords access to the capital markets. The Company anticipates that scheduled debt maturities in 2003 will be funded with cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operating activities. There are no provisions in any of the Companys material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in the Companys debt ratings. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock and warrants of Viacom that may be issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 billion. The registration statement was first declared effective on January 8, 2001. The net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by Viacom for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital and capital expenditures, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. To date, the Company has issued $1.635 billion of securities under the shelf registration statement. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company had a total of $1.1 billion of long term debt maturities, redemptions and repurchases and issued $1.3 billion of long term debt. The long term debt issuances maintained the Companys unused borrowing capacity and its financial flexibility. Planned capital expenditures for 2003 are approximately $600 million to $625 million. The Company spent $537.1 million during 2002. Capital expenditures are funded with cash flows from operations. Commitments and Contingencies The following table presents the Companys significant unrecorded contractual commitments as of December 31, 2002: 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 & thereafter Programming and talent commitments $ 3,042.3 $ 2,273.8 $ 2,004.3 $ 1,055.3 $ 886.7 $ 4,283.0 Operating leases $ 930.9 $ 791.5 $ 662.4 $ 637.8 $ 422.9 $ 1,725.3 Capital lease obligations (including interest) $ 118.1 $ 90.5 $ 75.2 $ 62.1 $ 52.0 $ 102.9 Guaranteed minimum franchise payments $ 378.2 $ 342.1 $ 303.6 $ 212.4 $ 81.3 $ 156.5 II 27 Commitments At December 31, 2002, programming and talent commitments of the Company not reflected on the balance sheet are estimated to aggregate approximately $13.5 billion. These commitments include approximately $9.3 billion for the acquisition of sports programming rights, approximately $3.1 billion relating to television, radio and feature film production and acquisitions and approximately $1.1 billion for talent contracts. A majority of such fees are payable over several years, as part of the normal course of business. The Company has long term noncancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. The Company has also entered into capital leases for satellite transponders and buildings. Viacoms outdoor advertising business has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media such as buses, trains, bus shelters, terminals, billboards, and phone kiosks. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchiser is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. At December 31, 2002, future guaranteed minimum franchise payments not reflected on the balance sheet are estimated to aggregate approximately $1.5 billion. Guarantees The Company owns a 50% equity interest in United Cinemas International ("UCI"), which operates movie theaters in Europe, Latin America and Asia. As of December 31, 2002, the Company guaranteed approximately $250.6 million of UCIs debt obligations under a revolving credit facility which expires in December 2004, and $155.5 million of UCIs theater leases. The Company also owns a 50% interest in WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. and Graumans Theatres, LLC and guarantees certain theater leases for approximately $14.7 million. The debt and lease guarantees would only be triggered upon non payment by the respective primary obligors. These guarantees are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. Additionally, the Company has letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $405.2 million at December 31, 2002 and are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company is also subject to certain off balance sheet lease guarantees related to the divestitures of certain businesses. In October 1998, Blockbuster Music stores were sold to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. ("Wherehouse"). Some of the leases transferred in connection with this sale had previously been guaranteed either by the Company or its affiliates. The remaining initial terms of these leases expire on various dates through 2007. However, certain leases contain renewal options that can extend the primary lease term and remain subject to the guarantee. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to any amount paid under these guarantees. On January 21, 2003, Wherehouse filed a petition for protection under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law. Based on information regarding lease and guaranty expirations provided to Blockbuster by Wherehouse in connection with its bankruptcy, Blockbusters current estimate of the contingent liability is approximately $36.0 million. Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 which represented its estimate of the undiscounted lease guaranty obligation associated with the stores that Wherehouse has indicated it will vacate. The Company has accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations. Legal Matters Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse II 28 was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had pending approximately 103,800 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 106,000 as of December 31, 2001 and approximately 100,000 as of December 31, 2000. The 2001 and 2000 numbers of claims included approximately 7,100 claims and 1,900 claims, respectively, on an inactive docket in Baltimore which would not be counted as pending under the Companys current methodology. In addition, the pending claim count was reduced by approximately 24,000 claims as a result of the Supreme Court of New Yorks order dated December 2002 establishing a deferred docket of claimants alleging minimal or no impairment. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2002, approximately 73,900 were pending in state courts, 27,100 in federal court and approximately 2,800 were third party claims. During 2002, the Company received approximately 49,400 new claims and closed approximately 18,500 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs in 2002 and 2001 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $28 million and $21 million, respectively. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities and that these asbestos liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort claims arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. Antitrust. In March 2001, after a series of judicial rulings, three individuals remained as plaintiffs in a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas against the Company, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment, and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries. They asserted, among other things, that the Company, Blockbuster and the studios conspired to fix the prices of videos to retailers and distributors, engaged in discriminatory pricing, and conspired to restrain competition. They were seeking treble damages for themselves and injunctive relief under both federal and California state law. In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the defendants. Plaintiffs have appealed the judgment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2001, a similar complaint was filed in California in a Los Angeles County Superior Court by over 200 individual plaintiffs seeking class certification and monetary damages against the same defendants. In January 2002, the California court denied the plaintiffs request for class certification, and the plaintiffs have appealed that decision to a California appellate court. By order dated February 20, 2003, the California state court judge dismissed with prejudice all claims against the defendants. The Company believes that the plaintiffs II 29 position in these litigations is without merit and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously in the litigations. Blockbuster Securities Action. During February and March 2003, three putative class action complaints were filed against Blockbuster in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas claiming violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and seeking a class determination for purchasers of Blockbuster stock for the approximately eight month period between April and December 2002. Certain members of Blockbusters senior management are also named as defendants. A shareholder derivative action arising from the same operative facts was filed in February 2003 in the same court; and another shareholder derivative action was filed in March 2003 in the 160th Judicial District Court for Dallas County, Texas claiming breach of fiduciary duties for an approximately three week period from late April through mid May 2002. These actions named certain Blockbuster directors, some of whom are directors and or executive officers of the Company, and certain members of Blockbusters senior management, as individual defendants, and Blockbuster as a nominal defendant. Responses have not yet been filed to any of these lawsuits. The Company believes the plaintiffs positions in these lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend these matters. Other. The Company has amounts owed by an international licensee under a series of long term licensing arrangements covering feature film and television product. The licensee is disputing its obligation to accept and to pay for a portion of this product under certain of these arrangements. The Company has brought suit to enforce its rights under those arrangements and strongly believes in the merits of its position. The licensee is attempting to reorganize under German insolvency law. As a result, the Company may be unable to recover some or all of amounts being sought in the litigation, as well as the undisputed sums owing under these arrangements. The Company however, believes that the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that all of the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business with companies in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the non designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of "Other items, net". The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2002, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $266.0 million, of which $49.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $217.0 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. At December 31, 2001, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $268.1 million, of II 30 which $76.6 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $191.5 million represented hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. Approximately 90% of consolidated revenues are generated in U.S. dollars, accordingly, a 10% fluctuation in foreign currrency rates would not have a material effect on results of operations. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is exposed to movements in short term rates. Swap agreements are used to modify this exposure. This includes both fixed to variable rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, and variable to fixed rate swaps, which are designed as cash flow hedges. Based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2002, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause a $23.7 million change to pre tax earnings. As of December 31, 2002 if both parties were to agree, the swaps could have been terminated by a net payment from the counterparties of approximately $75.1 million. On January 23, 2001, the Company, in connection with the acquisition of BET, assumed $425 million of cash flow swap agreements which effectively converted variable rate debt to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2002, the notional amount outstanding was approximately $175 million. The notional amount of swaps amortizes by approximately $156 million in September of 2003 and matures in September 2004. Interest is received based upon three month LIBOR and is paid at approximately 5.07%. The amount of the ineffectiveness of these cash flow hedges that was reflected in earnings was immaterial. The effective portion of the change in value of cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During the next twelve months, approximately $5.0 million will be amortized into earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedges included in earnings was not material. The change in value of the fair value hedges and the hedged instruments is reported in earnings for the periods presented. During December 2001, the Company entered into $750 million notional amount swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. Of the $750 million notional amount, $225 million matures on January 15, 2003, $275 million matures on September 1, 2003 and $250 million matures on June 1, 2005, and the Company receives interest at approximately 3.2%, 3.8% and 4.5%, respectively, and pays three month LIBOR. These fair value hedges were fully effective. During November 2002, the 3.2% and 3.8% swap agreements entered in December 2001 were terminated by the Company and the Company received approximately $8.7 million in cash which is being amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the respective debt. On April 24, 2002, the Company entered into additional $700 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2007 and the Company receives interest at approximately 5.11% on $400 million and 5.35% on $300 million, and pays three month LIBOR. Credit Risk The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions, which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. The Companys receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2002 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Companys products and services are sold. II 31 Related Parties National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") is a closely held corporation that beneficially owns the Companys Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 69% of the voting power of all classes of the Companys Common Stock, and approximately 11% of the Companys Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis at December 31, 2002. Owners of the Companys Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. The Companys Class B Common Stock does not have voting rights. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios including Paramount Pictures, a division of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, NAI made payments to Paramount Pictures in the aggregate amounts of approximately $12.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. The Company owns a minority equity interest in Westwood One, Inc. ("Westwood One"). Most of Infinitys radio stations are affiliated with Westwood One, and Westwood One distributes nationally certain of the Companys radio programming. In connection with these arrangements, the Company receives affiliation fees as well as programming cost reimbursements and in certain instances, shares in revenue from the sale by Westwood One of Infinitys programming. In addition, certain employees of Infinity serve as officers of Westwood One for which the Company receives a management fee. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $110.4 million, $94.8 million and $77.6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Recent Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"), effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs. SFAS 143 requires the capitalization of any retirement costs as part of the total cost of the related long lived asset and the subsequent allocation of the total expense to future periods using a systematic and rational method. In accordance with its provisions, the Company will record a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the first quarter of 2003 in connection with the implementation of this standard. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the Companys statements of operations, financial position or cash flows. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 144 establishes an accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, including discontinued operations. The adoption of SFAS 144 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. Effective December 31, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 145 "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections" ("SFAS 145"). SFAS 145 no longer requires gains and losses from the extinguishments of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item. Adoption of SFAS 145 resulted in the reclassification of $3.9 million of extraordinary loss net of tax, recorded for the year ended December 31, 2001 to interest expense. In June of 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" ("SFAS 146"), effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS 146 requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. The adoption of SFAS 146 will not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. II 32 Effective December 31, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148"), an amendment of Statement No. 123. SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition to a voluntary adoption of the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. In November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45"). FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Critical Accounting Policies Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates. Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with SOP 00 2, which requires managements judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments. The cost of Blockbusters rental library, which includes videocassettes, DVDs and games, is amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 12 months to an estimated residual value of $2 to $5 per unit, according to the product category. The estimates for useful lives and residual values of the rental library are continually evaluated based on changes in consumer demand. Changes in demand or buying patterns may impact the carrying value of the rental library and rental margins. During 2001, Blockbuster changed the estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for videocassettes and game products, which resulted in inventory write downs and increased amortization expense. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and II 33 liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. The Company assesses potential impairment of long lived assets under the guidance of SFAS 121 "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of." Goodwill and other intangibles are evaluated for impairment under the guidance of SFAS 142 which was adopted in the first quarter of 2002. Upon adoption, the Company determined that based on segment valuation studies with the exception of Blockbuster, none of the Companys reporting units had an impairment. The write down of Blockbusters goodwill of $1.8 billion was determined after the fair value of Blockbuster had been allocated to specific assets and liabilites and was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Subsequently, Blockbuster performed its annual impairment test on October 31, 2002 and there was no additional impairment under the provisions of SFAS 142 for 2002. SFAS 142 requires companies to test for goodwill impairment annually and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below the units carrying amount. During December 2002, Blockbuster performed an interim impairment test on its goodwill balance as of December 31, 2002 which determined that its estimated fair value, under SFAS 142, was in excess of book value. As a result, there was no additional impairment. Blockbuster will perform its annual impairment test for 2003 on October 31, 2003, and on an interim date in 2003 should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the estimated future cash flows could result in a material impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142. The Companys cost and equity investments, where market value has declined below cost, are regularly reviewed by management to determine whether or not there has been an other than temporary decline in market value. In making that determination, management considers the extent to which cost exceeds market value, the duration of the market decline, the investees earnings and cash forecasts and current cash position, among other factors. In 2002, the Company recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately $13.8 million. In 2001, the Company recorded a non cash impairment loss of approximately $125.0 million. Balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to taxes, legal issues, restructuring charges and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments and estimates by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued business, including environmental and asbestos are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled. The Company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption. The expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. For 2002, the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension plans increased significantly as a result of lowering the discount rate for the Companys major plans from 7.25% in 2001 to 6.50% in 2002, other actuarial losses and plan assets producing a return below the expected return due to market conditions in 2002. As of December 31, 2002, total pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of corresponding plan assets and therefore the Company recorded an additional pension liability of $865.0 million. The expected increased pension expense due to decreases in pension plan II 34 asset values and expected rate of return on such assets will not result in increased Company pension plan contributions. Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements This document and the documents incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10 K, including "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition", contain both historical and forward looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather reflect the Companys current expectations concerning future results and events. These forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect", "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will" or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe the Companys objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. The following important factors, among others, could affect future results, causing these results to differ materially from those expressed in the Companys forward looking statements: The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its over the air networks, basic cable networks, television stations, radio stations and outdoor businesses. The sale of advertising is affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising. Adverse changes to any of these factors, including as a result of acts of terrorism or war, could have a negative effect on revenues. Additionally, consumer and advertiser actions in response to the war in Iraq could have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations. Operating results derived from the Companys motion picture and television production businesses fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public, which are difficult to predict. Motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent, reduced availability of co financing opportunities, and other factors have resulted in higher production costs. In addition, the commercial success of the Companys motion picture and television productions depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions, and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities. The Companys operating results fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases, as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition. The Companys basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent upon affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home ("DTH") distributors on acceptable terms. The loss of carriage on such distributors, or continued carriage on less favorable terms, could adversely affect, with respect to basic cable networks, revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising, and with respect to premium subscription television networks, subscriber fee revenues. In addition, continued consolidation among cable and or DTH distributors could have an adverse effect on subscriber fee revenues. Some of the Companys businesses are seasonal. The home video and consumer publishing businesses are subject to increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays, while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is generated from May through II 35 September. In addition, the home video and theme parks businesses revenues are influenced by weather. The Companys radio and outdoor advertising businesses experience fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers and typically experience highest revenues in the fourth quarter and lowest revenues in the first quarter. The Companys home video retail business currently enjoys a competitive advantage over most other movie distribution channels, except theatrical releases, due to the early timing of the video retailer "distribution window." The Video business could be negatively affected if the video retail distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release; the length of the video retail distribution window was shortened; or the video retail distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now. The Company believes that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable video retail industry; however, the order, length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie and the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of any future decisions by the studios. Increased studio licensing of product to video on demand and similar services might impact their decisions with respect to the timing and exclusivity of the video retailer distribution window with possible adverse affect on the Video business. The Company cannot control or predict with certainty studio pricing policies for DVD and VHS product. "Sell through" pricing of DVDs has reduced the significance of the "rental window" for VHS product and has resulted in competition from mass merchant retailers at an earlier stage than is the case for VHS. If sell through pricing and competition cause consumers to increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies, the Video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to increase rental market share, to replace profits from rentals with profits from sales of sell through product, or to otherwise positively affect gross profits. In addition, if studios make future changes in their pricing policies, which could include pricing rental windows for DVDs or expanded exploitation by studios of any international copyright laws that allow studios to charge retailers more for DVD and VHS rental product than for sell through product, the profitability of the Video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to enter into arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations. Changes in FCC laws and regulations could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the operations and ownership of the Companys properties. The Company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued businesses, including environmental liabilities and pending litigation. While the pending or potential litigations, and environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance in this regard. The Company may be adversely affected by changes in technology and its effect on competition in the Companys markets, including technologies that increase the threat of content piracy. Other economic, business, competitive and or regulatory factors could affect the Companys businesses generally. These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results. The forward looking statements included in this document are only made as of the date of this document, and the Company does not have any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. The Company cannot make any assurances that projected results or events will be achieved. You should review carefully all information, including the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements, included or incorporated by reference into this Form 10 K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Response to this is included in "Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Market Risk."
