These forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will" or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe the Companys objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. More information about these risks, uncertainties and other factors is set forth on pages II 32 to II 35 of "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition."

The Company cannot make any assurance that projected results or events will be achieved. Item 2. Properties. The Company maintains its world headquarters at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York, where it rents approximately 1.2 million square feet for executive offices and certain of its operating divisions. The lease for the majority of the space runs to 2010, with four renewal options for five years each thereafter. The Company also leases the following major facilities in New York City for certain of its operating divisions: (a) approximately 548,000 square feet of office space at 1633 Broadway, New York, New York, which lease runs to 2010, and (b) approximately 237,000 square feet of office space at 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, which lease runs to 2009. The Company owns the building located at 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, containing approximately 900,000 square feet which is principally leased to third parties and houses approximately 250,000 square feet of office space used by the Company, and the CBS Broadcast Center complex located on approximately 3.7 acres at 524 West 57th Street, New York, New York and consists of approximately 860,000 square feet.

The Company also owns and leases office, studio, retail and warehouse space, broadcast, antenna and satellite transmission facilities and outdoor advertising properties throughout the U.S., Canada and several countries around the world for its businesses. The Company considers its properties adequate for its present needs. I 40 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had pending approximately 112,280 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 103,800 as of December 31, 2002 and approximately 106,000 as of December 31, 2001. The 2002 and 2001 numbers of claims included approximately 1,100 claims and 7,100 claims, respectively, on inactive dockets in various states which would not be counted as pending under the Companys current methodology. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2003, approximately 82,340 were pending in state courts, 27,400 in federal court and approximately 2,540 were third party claims. During 2003, the Company received approximately 36,990 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 28,500 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs (recovery) in 2003 and 2002 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $(8.7) million and $28 million, respectively. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. If proceeds received in 2003 from commuted insurance policies were excluded from the Companys total costs in 2003, the Companys total costs after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits would have been $56.6 million. Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos, lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure, other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease. Claims identified as cancer remain a small percentage of asbestos claims pending at December 31, 2003. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities and that these asbestos liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. Antitrust. In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the Company, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries with I 41 respect to a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint included federal antitrust and California state law claims. In August 2003, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal court judgment. The Supreme Court of the United States refused plaintiffs petition for writ of certiorari in March 2004. In February 2003, a similar complaint that had been filed in a Los Angeles County Superior Court was also dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the California state court dismissal, as well as a prior denial of class certification. The Company believes that the plaintiffs positions in these litigations are without merit and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in the litigations. Blockbuster Securities Actions. During February and March 2003, putative class action complaints were filed against Blockbuster in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. A director and certain officers of Blockbuster were also named as defendants. The remaining putative class actions have been consolidated into one action styled In re Blockbuster Inc. Securities Litigation, which is pending in the same court. The consolidated amended complaint, filed July 2003, claims violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the time period approximately between February and December 2002. It also generally alleges that the defendants made untrue statements of material fact and or omitted to disclose material facts about Blockbusters business and operations, that the value of Blockbusters common stock was therefore artificially inflated and that certain of the individual defendants sold shares of Blockbusters common stock at inflated prices. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. In addition, three shareholder derivative actions were filed in February, March and April 2003, of which one is pending in federal court in Texas and two have been consolidated into one action in Texas state court, each arising from substantially similar operative facts. These shareholder derivative actions include claims for breach of fiduciary duties for various time periods beginning in February 2002 and name certain Blockbuster officers and directors, some of whom are directors and or executive officers of the Company, as individual defendants, and Blockbuster as a nominal defendant. The Company and Blockbuster believe the plaintiffs positions in all of these actions are without merit and Blockbuster intends to vigorously defend these matters. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that all of the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

II 2  Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. (Tabular dollars in millions) Managements discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes.

Cable Networks contributed 21% to consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. TELEVISION: The Television segment consists of the CBS and UPN television networks, the Companys 39 owned broadcast television stations, and its television production and syndication business, including KING WORLD PRODUCTIONS and PARAMOUNT TELEVISION.

RADIO: The Radio segment owns and operates 185 radio stations in 41 U.S. markets through INFINITY RADIO. Radio revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales.

OUTDOOR: The Outdoor segment through VIACOM OUTDOOR displays advertising on media including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks and stadium signage.

Entertainment contributed 15% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and 16% for the year ended December 31, 2001. VIDEO: The Video segment consists of an approximately 81.5% equity interest in Blockbuster Inc., which operates and franchises 8,867 BLOCKBUSTER video stores worldwide.

II 3 On February 10, 2004, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the Company to pursue the divestiture of Viacoms approximately 81.5% interest in Blockbuster, based on the conclusion that Blockbuster would be better positioned as a company completely independent of Viacom. The Company anticipates that the divestiture would be achieved through a tax free split off, but will also continue to consider other alternatives. The transaction is subject to further approval of the Viacom Board and an assessment of market conditions. The split off, which would result in a reduction of Viacoms outstanding shares, is expected to be completed by mid 2004. Consolidated Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 and 2002 vs. 2001 Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2003, revenues of $26.6 billion increased 8% from $24.6 billion in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, revenues of $24.6 billion increased 6% from $23.2 billion in 2001. Revenue growth for each year primarily reflected increases in advertising sales, rental/retail sales and affiliate fees, along with continuing contributions from feature film exploitation. The table below presents the Companys consolidated revenues by type and the percentage and amount of contribution of each type of revenue to consolidated revenues, net of intercompany eliminations, for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues by Type Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Advertising sales $ 12,071.9 45 % $ 11,225.1 46 % $ 10,722.8 46 % Rental/retail sales 5,815.1 22 5,480.1 22 5,049.9 22 Affiliate fees 2,407.7 9 2,199.0 9 2,030.9 9 Feature film exploitation 2,212.4 8 1,860.0 7 1,853.6 8 TV license fees 1,514.5 6 1,472.2 6 1,359.2 6 Other 2,563.7 10 2,369.3 10 2,206.4 9 Total Revenues $ 26,585.3 100 % $ 24,605.7 100 % $ 23,222.8 100 % Advertising sales, which represented 45% of the Companys consolidated revenues for 2003, increased 8% in 2003 to $12.1 billion reflecting growth in all of the Companys segments which generate advertising revenues: Cable Networks, Television, Radio and Outdoor. The increase in advertising revenues was due to increased units sold and higher rates at the cable and broadcast networks and 7% higher U.S. billboard and 17% higher European outdoor revenues primarily driven by favorable exchange rates. For 2002, advertising sales increased 5% to $11.2 billion led by increases in Cable Networks, Television and Radio. The 2002 increase in advertising revenues was driven primarily by increased units sold at cable networks, as well as increases in average unit rates and units sold at the broadcast network operations. Rental/retail sales for 2003 were up 6% to $5.8 billion reflecting a 26% increase in retail sales and a 2% increase in rental sales. Both rental and retail growth were driven by an increase of 198 worldwide company operated stores since December 31, 2002, the acquisition of GameStation, Inc., a leading games retailer in the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of 2002 and favorable foreign exchange rates. Worldwide same store revenues declined 2.2% reflecting a 3.6% decline in same store rental revenues as a result of a weaker rental market worldwide partially offset by an increase in same store retail revenues of 3.7% reflecting growth in both movie and games sales. Rental/retail sales for 2002 were up 9% to $5.5 billion with rental sales growth of 3% and retail sales growth of 39% driven by an increase of 495 worldwide company operated stores since December 31, 2001 and increased DVD and game product sales. Affiliate fees for 2003 increased 9% to $2.4 billion primarily driven by rate increases and growth in subscriber volume at MTVN as well as the acquisition of Comedy Central in May 2003. Affiliate fees for II 4 2002 increased 8% to $2.2 billion reflecting rate increases at each of the Cable Networks as well as an increase in subscriber volume at MTV Networks digital channels. Feature film revenues increased 19% to $2.2 billion in 2003 primarily reflecting 62% higher worldwide home entertainment revenues from DVD sales and contributions from increased syndication, theatrical and pay television revenues partially offset by lower network revenues. Feature film revenues remained relatively flat in 2002 versus 2001 at $1.9 billion reflecting growth in DVD sales primarily offset by lower theatrical revenues. Television license fees increased 3% to $1.5 billion in 2003 principally reflecting increased syndication revenues due to a full year of results for THE DR. PHIL SHOW versus four months in 2002. Television license fee revenues increased 8% in 2002 to $1.5 billion primarily from increased syndication revenues from cable sales and revenues from THE DR. PHIL SHOW, launched in 2002. Other revenues, which include revenues from publishing, theme park operations, movie theaters and consumer products, increased 8% to $2.6 billion in 2003 primarily reflecting higher Nickelodeon consumer products revenues as well as higher theaters revenues from favorable foreign currency translation, higher admission prices and increased per capita spending. For 2002, other revenues increased 7% to $2.4 billion primarily due to higher publishing, theaters and Nickelodeon consumer products revenues. The Companys 2004 revenues are expected to benefit from the continued strengthening of the advertising market and from the Super Bowl telecast on CBS in February, as well as the full year impact of the Comedy Central acquisition. Assuming the divestiture of Blockbuster occurs, the Companys advertising supported businesses as a percentage of consolidated revenues would significantly increase. International Revenues The Company generated approximately 18% of its total revenues from international regions in 2003 and 16% in 2002 and 2001, principally from Europe and Canada. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Europe $ 2,839.8 58 % $ 2,263.4 56 % $ 2,030.6 54 % Canada 1,087.1 22 927.2 23 881.7 23 All other 960.1 20 838.6 21 844.0 23 Total International Revenues $ 4,887.0 100 % $ 4,029.2 100 % $ 3,756.3 100 % Operating Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2003, operating expenses of $16.3 billion increased 9% over 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, operating expenses of $14.9 billion increased 3% over 2001. The major components and changes in operating expenses were as follows: Production and program rights amortization expenses represented approximately 47% of total operating expenses in 2003 and reflect the costs and amortization of television and theatrical inventory, including direct production costs, residuals and participation expenses, production overhead and acquisition costs as well as costs attributable to television and radio programming expenses including on air talent and other production costs, and costs and amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast networks, cable networks and broadcast stations. For 2003, production and program rights amortization increased 11% over 2002 primarily due to 22% higher costs at Cable Networks, principally for new and existing programming at MTVN. Also contributing to the increases were higher costs for contractual series at the broadcast networks and more original summer programming, higher sports rights amortization at CBS Network and Radio II 5 and higher feature film amortization. Production and program rights amortization expenses for 2002 increased 4% over 2001 driven by contractual increases in costs associated with series at the broadcast networks and increases at the Company owned television stations due to new entertainment and sports programming investments. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses represented approximately 27% of total operating expenses in 2003 and include amortization of the costs of videocassette, DVD and game inventory, revenue sharing expenses on rental inventory, store employee compensation expense and occupancy expenses. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2003 increased 6% over 2002 reflecting an increase in rental/retail sales of 6%, an increase of 198 worldwide company operated stores partially offset by improved product buying and inventory management. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2002 increased 1% over 2001 reflecting a shift in product mix and the net increase of 495 worldwide company operated stores, partially offset by the 2001 charge associated with Blockbusters re merchandising and store reconfiguration plans. Distribution expenses, which represented approximately 9% of total operating expenses in 2003, reflect advertising and other distribution costs incurred primarily with respect to theatrical and television product. Distribution expenses for 2003 increased 11% over 2002 reflecting higher print and advertising costs for feature films in theatrical release. Distribution expenses for 2002 increased 8% over 2001 reflecting higher costs associated with prints and advertising due to the higher number of feature films released partially offset by a decrease in other distribution costs. Other operating expenses for 2003, included an increase in Outdoor expenses of 7%, reflecting higher rotation and embellishment expenses for billboards. Outdoor expenses for 2002 increased 10% over 2001 reflecting higher guarantee payments for transit contracts. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, which include expenses incurred to provide back office support, occupancy, selling and marketing costs, increased 4% to $4.4 billion in 2003 reflecting increased costs from Comedy Central, acquired in May 2003, increased employee related expenses and higher directors and officers insurance premiums and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a pre tax gain of $40 million received in 2003 from the settlement of a 2001 physical damage and business interruption claim. For 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $4.2 billion. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 16% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 17% for 2002 and 18% for 2001. Advertising expenses remained relatively flat at $1.4 billion for 2003 and 2002 reflecting higher advertising costs for feature films in theatrical release offset by decreases at Blockbuster. Advertising expenses decreased 5% in 2002 versus 2001 reflecting lower advertising spending at the broadcast and cable networks and Company owned television stations partially offset by increases at Blockbuster for marketing efforts associated with key rental and retail promotions. Included within selling, general and administrative expenses are residual costs, which primarily include pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. Residual costs for 2003 increased to $146.5 million from $67.8 million principally due to actuarial losses from a lower discount rate and a decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets in 2003. Residual costs decreased to $67.8 million in 2002 from $87.2 million in 2001 due primarily to the recognition of actuarial gains for benefit plans of certain divested businesses. II 6 Impairment and Restructuring Charges During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non cash impairment charge related to Blockbuster of approximately $1.3 billion in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. In completing its analysis of the fair value of the video business during the fourth quarter of 2003, several events led Blockbuster to conclude that the business had incremental risks that were required to be included in its evaluation of goodwill. These events included Blockbusters lower than anticipated same store revenues during the December 2003 selling season caused by increased competition from retail DVD and other home video distribution channels. Blockbuster also identified risks associated with certain international operations, such as increased competition, two tiered pricing and piracy. Additionally, Blockbusters review of long lived assets in conjunction with SFAS 144 resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $18.5 million to reduce the carrying value of certain fixed assets in four international markets. These charges were included in "Impairment and restructuring charges" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, restructuring charges of $26.4 million were recorded at Cable Networks. These charges principally reflected $17.7 million of severance liabilities resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Comedy Central that the Company did not own and organizational changes at Showtime Networks Inc. Also included in this total was $8.4 million for additional lease termination costs for MTVN due to a change in the initial estimate for its 2001 charge. In 2001, the Company recorded a Cable Networks restructuring charge of $66.6 million for MTVN and a UPN restructuring charge of $52.8 million. These charges were principally associated with reducing headcount and closing certain MTVN domestic and foreign offices and integrating UPN into CBS Network operations. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and amortization increased 6% to $999.8 million principally driven by an increase of 198 company operated video stores and the addition of broadcasting equipment and outdoor advertising properties. For the year ended December 31, 2002, depreciation and amortization decreased to $945.6 million as compared with $3.1 billion for 2001. This decrease was due to the Companys initial adoption of SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002, and as a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense decreased 9% to $776.0 million from $848.3 million primarily due to a reduction in debt including lower average commercial paper borrowings. The Company had approximately $10.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at weighted average interest rates of 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense decreased 12% to $848.3 million from $969.2 million due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates. The Company had approximately $11.5 billion at December 31, 2001 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at a weighted average interest rate of 6.8%. Interest Income For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest income decreased to $14.8 million from $15.8 million in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest income decreased to $15.8 million from $30.6 million in 2001 due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in 2002 versus 2001. II 7 Other Items, Net For the year ended December 31, 2003, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $3.4 million principally consisting of foreign exchange losses of $2.3 million, losses associated with securitizing trade receivables of $14.8 million and an aggregate loss of $7.0 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value, partially offset by a net gain on the disposition of investments of $14.8 million and an insurance recoupment of $5.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $30.0 million which principally consisted of foreign exchange losses of $51.9 million, losses of $19.7 million associated with securitizing trade receivables and an aggregate loss of approximately $13.8 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value. These losses were partially offset by the recovery of advertising commitments of $29.8 million, a gain of $18.8 million on the sale of a telephone kiosk advertising business and a net gain of $5.5 million from the sale of investments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, "Other items, net" of $254.7 million principally reflected a gain from television station swaps of $210.1 million and the recovery of certain advertising commitments of $250.0 million offset by impairment losses of approximately $125.0 million related to the Companys investments. The one time pre tax gains were also partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $8.2 million and losses of $22.8 million associated with securitizing trade receivables. Additionally, 2001 reflects an impairment loss of $46.6 million related to the purchase of two television stations. The recovery of advertising commitments in 2002 and 2001 reflected the restructuring of agreements with several Internet companies. As a result, the Company was released from related advertising commitments and reversed related deferred revenues. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. For 2003, the annual effective tax rate, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting was 55.9% in 2003, 38.8% in 2002 and 118.5% in 2001. The annual 2003 rate was adversely affected by the non cash charge recorded to reduce the carrying value of Blockbuster goodwill. Excluding the non cash charge, the annual effective tax rate was 39.8% in 2003. The annual 2001 rate was adversely affected by non deductible goodwill amortization. Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $.6 million for 2003, $39.5 million for 2002 and $127.0 million for 2001. The amounts principally reflected operating losses from Internet investments and international ventures partially offset by positive results of Westwood One and Comedy Central prior to its acquisition in May 2003. Additionally, 2001 reflected operating losses from Internet equity investments that were no longer operating in 2002. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest for 2003 and 2002 primarily represented the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Minority interest increased in 2003 principally due to recording the minority interest portion of the 2003 Blockbuster non cash charge. Minority interest for 2001 primarily represented the minority ownership of Infinity prior to its merger with the Company on February 21, 2001, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest and Tax Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which requires the capitalization of asset retirement costs as part of the total cost of the II 8 related long lived asset and the depreciation of this cost over the corresponding assets useful life. As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded a charge of $18.5 million, or $.01 per share, reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142 and recorded an after tax non cash charge of $1.5 billion (net of minority interest of $336.1 million), or $.84 per basic and $.83 per diluted share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net Earnings (Loss) The Company reported net earnings of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 versus net earnings of $725.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a net loss of $223.5 million for 2001. The improvement in net earnings in 2003 was primarily due to revenue growth from increases in advertising, feature film exploitation, rental/retail sales and affiliate fees and the non cash impairment charge of $1.5 billion recorded in 2002 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax. These increases were partially offset by the non cash Blockbuster charge of $1.0 billion, net of minority interest and tax, recorded in 2003 and increases in operating expenses primarily from programming and production costs. The substantial improvement in 2002 over 2001 reflected revenue growth principally from advertising sales and the reduction of amortization expense resulting from the implementation of SFAS 142 partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2002. II 9  Segment Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 The tables below present the Companys revenues, operating income and depreciation and amortization by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

(b)Primarily include pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. (c)Eliminations in all periods principally reflect the timing of intercompany transactions from the sale of television product to Cable Networks and the sale of feature films to cable and broadcast networks and the Video segment. II 10 Segment Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 and 2002 vs. 2001 Cable Networks (Basic Cable Television Program Services through MTV Networks ("MTVN"), including MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite, TV Land, MTV2, Spike TV, Comedy Central and CMT; BET and BET Jazz: The Jazz Channel; and through Showtime Networks Inc. ("SNI"), owner of several Premium Subscription Television Program Services) (Contributed 21% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 5,645.5 $ 4,726.7 $ 4,297.6 Operating income (OI) $ 2,172.3 $ 1,772.2 $ 1,234.9 OI as a % of revenues 38% 37% 29% Depreciation and amortization $ 195.3 $ 190.9 $ 447.1 Capital expenditures $ 90.3 $ 95.7 $ 139.9 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Cable Networks revenues increased 19% to $5.6 billion principally driven by 26% growth in advertising revenues and a 9% increase in affiliate fees. Approximately 9% of Cable Networks revenues were generated from international regions, of which approximately 68% came from Europe. Comedy Centrals results have been consolidated in this segment as part of MTVN effective from the date of its acquisition on May 22, 2003. For 2003, advertising revenues increased 26% reflecting 27% growth at MTVN principally due to selling more units and higher average unit rates. BET delivered 17% advertising revenue growth for 2003 over the prior year as a result of higher average rates. The 9% increase in affiliate fees was primarily due to rate and subscriber increases at MTVN and BET partially offset by declines at SNI. Other ancillary revenues for Cable Networks, which represented 9% of revenues for 2003 and 8% for 2002, grew 40% reflecting higher consumer product licensing revenues at Nickelodeon and contributions from co produced feature films. Cable Networks revenue growth benefited from Comedy Central contributions of 8% to advertising, 3% to affiliate and 5% to ancillary revenue growth for the year. During the second quarter of 2003, restructuring charges of $26.4 million were recorded at Cable Networks. These charges principally reflected $17.7 million of severance liabilities resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central that the Company did not own and organizational changes at SNI. Also included in this total was $8.4 million for additional lease termination costs for MTVN due to a change in the initial estimate for its 2001 charge. For 2003, Cable Networks operating income increased 23% reflecting higher revenues partially offset by increased expenses. Operating expenses, principally comprised of programming and production costs for the cable channels, increased 23%, led by increases at MTVN and BET primarily for new programming initiatives and the impact of Comedy Central. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% primarily due to higher marketing costs at MTVN and the inclusion of Comedy Central, which contributed 5% of the increase. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved one percentage point for the year. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% to $4.7 billion principally driven by 12% growth in advertising revenues and 8% growth in affiliate fees. MTVNs advertising revenues increased 11% due to selling more units, partially offset by a reduction of average unit rates. Cable affiliate fees increased 8% II 11 principally due to mid single digit rate increases at MTVNs domestic channels, excluding digital, an 18% increase in domestic subscribers principally due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Noggin and the expansion of MTVN digital channels and mid single digit average rate increases at SNI. Other ancillary revenues were principally comprised of consumer product licensing revenues from Nickelodeon. For 2002, Cable Networks operating income increased 44% as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The increase also reflected the impact of the MTVN charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The MTVN charge reflected $66.6 million for severance due to a reduction in workforce and for lease termination costs. In conjunction with the restructuring, $8.8 million was recorded as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. Operating expenses increased 7% principally driven by higher programming costs at MTV, Nickelodeon, Spike TV and SNI. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% primarily due to higher compensation expense from sales commissions as a result of revenue growth. Television (CBS and UPN Television Networks and Stations; Television Production and Syndication) (Contributed 29% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, 30% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 31% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 7,761.0 $ 7,456.8 $ 7,218.7 Operating income (OI) $ 1,238.1 $ 1,177.6 $ 385.8 OI as a % of revenues 16% 16% 5% Depreciation and amortization $ 151.1 $ 140.8 $ 786.4 Capital expenditures $ 123.6 $ 138.7 $ 120.2 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Television revenues increased 4% to $7.8 billion primarily driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, and higher syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 6%, with 8% growth in CBS primetime due primarily to a 6% average rate increase. Late night, daytime and news advertising revenues were up with average rate increases partially offset by a rate decrease at sports, due primarily to the impact of the war on the broadcast of the NCAA basketball tournament. The Stations group delivered 2% year over year advertising revenue growth led by ratings improvements for the CBS Network, particularly at 10 pm, which improved the stations local news and syndication as well as higher sales in the automotive, leisure and media industries. The Stations group also benefited from the full year results of KCAL TV Los Angeles, acquired in May 2002, which contributed 3% to the revenue growth for the year. These increases were more than offset by the absence of political advertising which was down over 80% versus the prior year. Higher syndication revenues for the year were partially offset by a decrease in domestic syndication availabilities and home entertainment revenues. Syndication revenues were higher primarily due to increases in license fees and barter revenues for THE DR. PHIL SHOW which debuted in September 2002 and higher barter revenues from EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. Revenue from domestic syndication availabilities in 2003 included THE PARKERS, SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH and the off network syndication of seasons one through five of BECKER, and did not match last years initial basic cable syndication availabilities including 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED and SEVEN DAYS. Home entertainment revenues decreased as contributions from the DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE did not match the contributions from last years DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. II 12 For 2003, Television operating income increased 5% principally due to the revenue increases noted above. Operating expenses, principally comprised of production costs and programming expenses, increased 5% for the year. CBS Network experienced higher programming costs due to more hours of original summer programming, contractual series increases in primetime and increased sports rights payments which were associated with the first year of new contracts with both the NCAA and the PGA Tour. The Stations group incurred higher operating expenses for the year principally due to expansion of news coverage and talent partially offset by reduced advertising and promotion. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, remained flat. Television operating income for 2003 included approximately $27 million from insurance recoveries. License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $634.9 million and $668.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including intercompany revenues of $345.2 million and $366.8 million. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Television revenues increased 3% to $7.5 billion principally driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, partially offset by lower syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 2%, with 9% growth for both CBS and UPN in primetime due to 5% average rate increases, partially offset by rate decreases in daytime and news dayparts. CBS Network had additional units available for sale in 2002 versus the prior year when there were fewer units available as a result of the events of September 11, during which CBS ran sustained news coverage from September 11 through September 14, 2001. CBS Network sold approximately 85% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2002/2003 season versus 65% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2001/2002 season. The revenue increases were partially offset by the absence of the Super Bowl, which CBS televised in 2001. The Stations group delivered 12% year over year advertising revenue growth led by increased political ads and higher sales in the automotive and services industries. The acquisition of KCAL TV Los Angeles in May 2002 contributed 5% of the Stations group revenue growth for the year. For 2002, Television revenues also reflected a decrease in domestic and foreign syndication revenues and lower network revenues, partially offset by higher home entertainment revenues. Domestic syndication revenues included revenues from the initial availability to cable of 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED, SISTER, SISTER, and ANY DAY NOW as well as higher library revenues from THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW and HAPPY DAYS. However, these revenues did not match the absence of contributions from the syndication of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and CHEERS in the prior year and license fees from cancelled series including STAR TREK: VOYAGER, DR. LAURA and REAL TV. Foreign syndication revenues were lower primarily resulting from lower current series revenues partially offset by higher revenues from library product. Network revenues decreased as revenues from new series in the 2002/2003 season were more than offset by the absence of revenues from canceled series. Home entertainment revenues were higher primarily from the DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. For 2002, Television operating income increased to $1.2 billion from $385.8 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The increase also reflected the impact of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations. Production and programming expenses at the broadcast networks increased 1.5%, principally reflecting higher costs in primetime due to contractual series increases and higher sports rights offset by lower NFL costs due to the absence of the Super Bowl in 2002. The Stations group incurred higher costs for syndicated programming and sports rights. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. II 13 Radio (Radio Stations) (Contributed 8% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 2,097.6 $ 2,121.6 $ 2,014.8 Operating income (OI) $ 975.0 $ 1,007.6 $ 382.4 OI as a % of revenues 46% 47% 19% Depreciation and amortization $ 27.4 $ 30.8 $ 608.0 Capital expenditures $ 14.1 $ 14.4 $ 12.4 2003 vs. 2002 Radio revenues are generated from 185 domestic radio stations. For 2003, Radio revenues of $2.1 billion reflected a 1% increase in advertising revenues primarily from national sales. The advertising revenue growth was more than offset by lower ancillary revenues principally related to management services provided to Westwood One, an affiliated company. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For 2003, Radio operating income decreased 3% principally due to the revenue decrease and an increase in expenses. Operating expenses, primarily comprised of radio programming expenses including on air talent, program rights amortization and other production costs, increased 7% for the year primarily reflecting contractual talent increases as well as increased sports rights. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3%, reflecting $13 million of insurance recoveries and lower advertising and promotional expenditures for the year. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased one percentage point. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Radio revenues increased 5% to $2.1 billion. Advertising revenues increased 5% driven by an increase in spots sold for the year, with average spot rates increasing slightly. Radio also experienced an increase in ancillary revenues principally related to management services provided to Westwood One. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Radio operating income increased to $1.0 billion from $382 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, offset by incremental expenses associated with acquired sports rights. Outdoor (Outdoor Advertising Properties) (Contributed 7% of consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 1,748.3 $ 1,633.5 $ 1,656.6 Operating income (loss) (OI) $ 207.9 $ 218.0 $ (90.6 ) OI as a % of revenues 12% 13% NM Depreciation and amortization $ 215.9 $ 205.6 $ 617.9 Capital expenditures $ 58.1 $ 67.1 $ 86.9 NM Not meaningful II 14 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Outdoor revenues increased 7% to $1.7 billion reflecting a 17% increase from its European properties and a 2% increase in North America. Revenue growth from its European properties was principally driven by favorable foreign exchange rates. North American results reflected higher revenues from U.S. billboards, driven by an increase in the number of displays, partially offset by lower revenues from the U.S. transit business, due to a decrease in the number of displays and in the average per unit rate, and lower revenues from billboards in Mexico. Approximately 43% of Outdoor revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe, in 2003 compared with 41% in 2002. For 2003, Outdoor operating income decreased 5% to $207.9 million as the revenue increase was more than offset by a 9% increase in total expenses principally due to higher billboard lease costs and sales related expenses as well as in transit guarantees and posting rotation expenses due to shorter campaigns. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased one percentage point for the year. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Outdoor revenues decreased 1% to $1.6 billion due to weakness in the outdoor advertising market during the first half of 2002. The decline in revenues reflected a 5% decrease in domestic revenues, partially offset by a 4% increase in revenues from its European properties. Approximately 41% and 40% of Outdoors revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe, for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Outdoor operating income for 2002 increased to $218.0 million from an operating loss of $90.6 million, as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Operating income also reflected higher guarantee payments on transit contracts in 2002 versus 2001. Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; Consumer Publishing as well as the operation of Theme Parks, Movie Theaters and Music Publishing) (Contributed 15% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and 16% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 4,101.3 $ 3,680.1 $ 3,626.8 Operating income (OI) $ 271.4 $ 358.3 $ 215.3 OI as a % of revenues 7% 10% 6% Depreciation and amortization $ 129.7 $ 120.7 $ 182.8 Capital expenditures $ 66.4 $ 74.6 $ 54.9 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Entertainment revenues increased 11% to $4.1 billion principally reflecting higher Features, Theaters and Consumer Publishing revenues. Approximately 37% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were higher principally due to increased worldwide home entertainment, theatrical and pay television revenues, partially offset by lower network revenues. Worldwide home entertainment revenues included contributions from THE ADVENTURES OF INDIANA JONES THE COMPLETE DVD MOVIE COLLECTION, HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS, THE ITALIAN JOB and LARA CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE. Domestic theatrical revenues were lower than the prior year due in part to fewer titles in domestic theatrical release. Foreign theatrical revenues were higher than the prior year primarily due to contributions from HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS, LARA II 15 CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE and THE ITALIAN JOB. Pay television revenues were higher while network revenues were lower compared to the prior year, both reflecting a change in the mix of titles available. Theaters revenues increased 12% principally due to the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation, higher average admission prices and increased per capita spending, which more than offset a decline in attendance. Parks revenues increased slightly for the year primarily due to a 1% increase in average per capita spending and the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 2% decline in attendance. Publishing revenues increased 3% on the strength of its top selling titles for the year which included "THE ULTIMATE WEIGHT SOLUTION" by Dr. Phil McGraw, "LIVING HISTORY" by Hillary Rodham Clinton and "THE DARK TOWER V (WOLVES OF THE CALLA)" by Stephen King. For 2003, Entertainment operating income decreased 24% to $271.4 million, as the revenue increases noted above were more than offset by increased Features distribution and film amortization costs. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased three percentage points. License fees for television exhibition of completed motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $1.2 and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including intercompany revenues of $281.1 million and $303.7 million. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $3.7 billion principally reflecting higher Publishing, Theaters and Features revenues, partially offset by lower Parks revenues. Approximately 33% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were slightly higher principally due to higher network television, domestic home video, domestic syndication and pay television revenues, which were partially offset by lower worldwide theatrical, foreign syndication, foreign pay television and foreign home video revenues. Domestic theatrical revenues primarily included contributions from the theatrical release of THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, WE WERE SOLDIERS, JACKASS THE MOVIE, CHANGING LANES and STAR TREK NEMESIS. Worldwide home video revenues were higher than last years revenues including contributions from VANILLA SKY, JIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS and WE WERE SOLDIERS. Worldwide home video revenues included increases from the growth in demand for current releases and library titles in the DVD format and an overall decline in the demand for the VHS format. Theaters revenues increased 7% due to higher average admission prices, higher attendance and increased per capita concession spending. Attendance in 2002 increased 3% compared with the prior year. Average admission prices and per capita concession spending both increased 5% over the prior year. Publishing revenues increased 4% primarily due to income from new distribution agreements and higher sales in the Adult Group and Childrens Book and Audio Divisions. The top selling titles for 2002 included "FROM A BUICK 8" by Stephen King, "SELF MATTERS" by Dr. Phil McGraw and "EVERYTHINGS EVENTUAL" also by Stephen King. II 16  For 2002, Entertainment operating income increased 66% to $358.3 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Operating income benefited from the revenue increases noted above and from lower development and overhead costs at Features and lower depreciation expense at Theaters. Video (Home videocassette, DVD and video game rental and retail operations) (Contributed 22% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, 23% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 22% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 5,911.7 $ 5,565.9 $ 5,156.7 Operating income (OI) $ (847.8 ) $ 355.8 $ (219.6 ) OI as a % of revenues NM 6% NM Depreciation and amortization $ 257.9 $ 233.8 $ 423.7 Capital expenditures $ 176.8 $ 140.6 $ 93.1 NM Not meaningful 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Video revenues increased 6% to $5.9 billion as a result of growth in rental and retail revenues. International revenues accounted for 26% of total revenues with 62% from Europe and 20% from Canada. The following is a summary of revenues by category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Rental $ 4,533.5 77 % $ 4,460.4 80 % $ 4,314.7 84 % Retail 1,281.6 22 1,019.7 18 735.2 14 Other 96.6 1 85.8 2 106.8 2 Total revenues $ 5,911.7 100 % $ 5,565.9 100 % $ 5,156.7 100 % The increase in revenues was primarily due to a net increase of 198 company operated stores, favorable exchange rates and the fourth quarter of 2002 acquisitions of GameStation, Inc., a leading games retailer in the United Kingdom, and the remaining interest in joint venture stores in Italy. Worldwide same store revenues decreased 2.2% as a result of a 3.6% decrease in worldwide same store rental revenues, partially offset by a 3.7% increase in worldwide same store retail revenues. The decline in worldwide same store rental revenues was primarily the result of a weaker market worldwide. While the rental market slowed during 2003, retail demand for DVDs and games continued to increase and Blockbuster capitalized on this growth during the first half of 2003. The growth in same store retail revenues slowed during the second half of 2003 as Blockbuster competed against strong same store sales growth in the prior year. During the third and fourth quarters of 2002, Blockbuster implemented several promotions to increase demand for retail product. These initiatives were reduced in 2003 in order to focus on improving profitability. II 17 Rental Revenues For 2003, rental revenues increased 1.6% to $4.5 billion due primarily to increases in movie rental revenues, offset slightly by decreased game rental revenues. The following is a summary of rental revenues by product category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Movie rental: VHS $ 1,435.7 32 % $ 2,190.1 49 % $ 3,057.8 71 % DVD 2,599.7 57 1,741.0 39 799.1 18 Total movie rental 4,035.4 89 3,931.1 88 3,856.9 89 Game rental 498.1 11 529.3 12 457.8 11 Total rental revenues $ 4,533.5 100 % $ 4,460.4 100 % $ 4,314.7 100 % The increase in rental revenues was primarily due to a net increase of 198 company operated stores, favorable exchange rates and the fourth quarter of 2002 acquisition of the remaining interest in joint venture stores in Italy, partially offset by a 3.6% decrease in worldwide same store rental revenues, driven by decreases in both movies and games. The decrease in same store rental revenues was the result of a generally weaker rental market and increased competition from retail DVD sales as compared to prior year. Domestic operations represented 78.6% of rental revenues in 2003 as compared with 81.8% in 2002. Blockbusters rental revenues are generated from the rental of VHS tapes, DVDs, video games and from any eventual sale of previously rented VHS tapes, DVDs and video games. Revenues generated from rental transactions include revenues received in connection with the initial rental of product, as well as revenues related to any continuations of such rentals past the initial rental period, as contemplated by Blockbusters membership agreement. Blockbuster believes the decline in same store rental revenues was in line with the overall industry, reflecting a softening in the movie rental industry during the fourth quarter of 2003 and increased competition from retail DVD sales. Based upon Blockbusters belief that the size of the video rental market has contracted as a result of the competition from DVD sell through, simultaneous availability of rental and retail product and availability of other home video distribution channels, they expect the market to continue to decline slightly in the coming year. Retail Revenues For 2003, retail revenues increased 26% to $1.3 billion due to increases in both movie and game sales. The following is a summary of retail revenues by product category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Movie sales: VHS $ 65.2 5 % $ 128.8 13 % $ 167.9 23 % DVD 516.4 40 370.4 36 178.8 24 Total movie sales 581.6 45 499.2 49 346.7 47 Game sales 305.0 24 164.7 16 31.0 4 General retail 395.0 31 355.8 35 357.5 49 Total retail revenues $ 1,281.6 100 % $ 1,019.7 100 % $ 735.2 100 % Retail revenues continued to grow as a percentage of total revenues during 2003, representing 21.7% of total revenues in 2003, compared with 18.3% of total revenues in 2002. The increase in overall retail II 18 revenues was primarily the result of the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 of GameStation, Inc., favorable exchange rates and an increase in company operated stores. In addition, worldwide same store retail revenues increased 3.7% driven by increases across all categories. Overall, retail revenue growth reflected an increase in units sold, both for movies and games, as well as an increase in the average unit price for movies due to a higher DVD mix, partially offset by a lower average unit price for games. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Blockbuster recorded a non cash charge of approximately $1.3 billion resulting from the application of SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 to reduce the carrying value of its goodwill and other long lived assets which resulted in an operating loss of $847.8 million for full year 2003. The impact of the charge more than offset the increase in gross profit that was driven by the overall growth in revenues and gross margin to 59.6% in 2003 from 57.6% in 2002, with both rental and retail gross margins improving year over year. Blockbuster ended 2003 with 8,867 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 198 company operated stores and 124 franchise stores over December 31, 2002. Viacom currently owns approximately 81.5% of Blockbuster (NYSE: BBI). 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Video revenues increased 8% to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion principally driven by an increase of 5.1% in worldwide same store revenues and a net increase of 495 company operated stores from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. Domestic revenues increased 7% while international revenues increased 13%. International revenues represented approximately 21% of Video revenues, with approximately 55% from Europe and 23% from Canada. Worldwide same store revenues, which includes rental and retail product, increased 5.1% primarily resulting from 32.6% growth in same store retail revenues, and 0.9% growth in same store rental revenues over the prior year. Domestic and international same store revenues increased 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Blockbuster ended 2002 with 8,545 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 495 company operated stores and 69 franchise stores over December 31, 2001. For 2002, Video operating income increased to $355.8 million from a loss of $219.6 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The improvement in operating income was also due to the charge reflected in 2001 results as described below. Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for lease obligations related to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in January 2003. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these lease guarantees. The Company has accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations and the $18.7 million had no impact on the Companys operating results for 2002. During the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster began implementation of a strategic re merchandising plan to allow for an expansion of store space for DVD and other strategic product offerings, which it completed by December 31, 2001. In connection with its plan, Blockbuster disposed of approximately 30% of its rental VHS library in its stores, certain VHS merchandise inventory primarily located in its distribution center and certain games from its rental library in its stores. The net book value of the eliminated inventory, net of proceeds, resulted in a primarily non cash charge of approximately $195.9 million to operating expenses in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Blockbuster also recorded a charge of approximately $26.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to employee, labor and supply and disposal costs to execute the plan. Additionally, $2.6 million was charged to depreciation expense for the write off of fixed assets and $1.9 million was charged below operating income to equity in loss of affiliated companies for the adoption of a similar re merchandising plan at one of Blockbusters joint venture operations. The plan was completed by the end of 2001 through the destruction or sale of the identified items. II 19 Also, during the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster recorded approximately $27.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to two lawsuits. The amounts described above, including $141.7 million recorded as the change in accounting estimates for rental inventory, represented the 2001 pre tax charge of approximately $396.6 million. Financial Position Current assets increased 8% to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2003 from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily due to an increase of $615.3 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $219.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in other current assets of $133.4 million. The increase in accounts receivable was driven primarily by higher fourth quarter revenues from Entertainment as well as increased advertising and affiliate revenues at MTV Networks. Also contributing to this increase was the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central, as well as the timing of customer payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 6.4% at December 31, 2003 compared with 7.0% at December 31, 2002. This decrease reflected improved receivable aging at the end of 2003 and favorable customer settlements during the year. Net property and equipment decreased $120.7 million to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.1 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $896.8 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $534.4 million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $158.8 million and the addition of capital leases of $80.3 million. Goodwill of $57.1 billion decreased $59.5 million from December 31, 2002, reflecting the $1.3 billion non cash charge related to Blockbusters goodwill, partially offset by additional goodwill resulting from acquisitions, primarily the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central. Current liabilities increased $238.8 million to $7.6 billion primarily due to increases of $159.7 million in income taxes payable and $195.4 million in participants share, residuals and royalties payable, primarily for feature films. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $122.3 million, primarily relating to purchases made by Blockbuster at the end of 2002. Total debt, including current maturities, decreased $524.7 million to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2003 principally reflecting the use of cash from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Minority interest of $627.0 million at December 31, 2003 decreased $218.2 million from $845.2 million at December 31, 2002 reflecting the impact on minority owners of the write down of Blockbusters goodwill, as well as the purchases of Blockbuster Class A common stock in 2003 in order to maintain Viacoms consolidated tax position with Blockbuster. Cash Flows Operating Activities. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected net earnings of $1.4 billion adjusted for non cash charges of $1.3 billion and depreciation and amortization of $999.8 million. Additionally, operating cash flow reflected increases in participation liabilities and decreases in other assets offset by increases in receivables noted above and payments of accounts payable. The reduction in accounts payable was largely attributable to the purchases of merchandise inventory by Blockbuster at the end of 2002. Operating cash flow also benefited from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $77.1 million. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected net earnings of $725.7 million adjusted for non cash charges of $1.5 billion for the adoption of SFAS 142 and depreciation and amortization of $945.6 million. Additionally, operating cash flow benefited from the utilization of deferred tax assets of $655 million and from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $210.3 million. These increases were partially offset by an additional investment in Blockbusters merchandise and rental inventory and increased program rights for television series and sports. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected a net loss of $223.5 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of II 20 $3.1 billion, and for the 2001 Blockbuster, MTVN and UPN charges plus decreases in accounts receivable, partially offset by payments of accrued expenses and accounts payable. Cash paid for income taxes of $933.9 million for 2003 was higher than 2002 payments of $630.1 million principally due to higher operating income (excluding the non cash impairment charge) as well as the absence of 2002 non recurring items. The Company anticipates that higher operating income and the absence of non recurring tax attributes in 2004 will result in an increase in cash payments for taxes of approximately $500 million to $700 million over 2003 levels. While the Company does not have direct access to Blockbusters cash flow, should the Company complete the divestiture of Blockbuster in 2004, the Companys operating cash flow would decrease by the amount of their cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Blockbusters operating cash flow was approximately 17% of the Companys consolidated cash flow. Investing Activities. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected acquisitions of $1.3 billion, capital expenditures of $534.4 million principally for video stores, broadcasting equipment and outdoor advertising structures and additional investments of $40.0 million in affiliated companies. Acquisitions primarily consisted of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central, as well as Outdoors acquisition of a billboard operator in Puerto Rico and the purchase of $62.3 million of Blockbuster Class A stock by the Company in order to maintain its ownership interest of at least 80% for tax consolidation purposes. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets totaling $47.3 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected capital expenditures of $537.1 million, additional investments of $60.8 million in affiliated companies and acquisitions of $926.0 million primarily reflecting the acquisition of KCAL TV and the remaining interest in Noggin that the Company did not already own. Activity in 2002 also reflected Blockbusters acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in an Italy joint venture and the acquisition of a games retailer in the United Kingdom. During 2002, the Company acquired shares of Blockbusters Class A common stock for $11.2 million. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets totaling $72.2 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected the acquisitions of BET and outdoor businesses and capital expenditures of $515.4 million partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of radio stations and other assets. Capital expenditures for 2004 are anticipated to be approximately $700 million. The increase over 2003 levels is primarily to support Blockbusters various revenue and profitability growth initiatives, as well as systems and infrastructure improvements. The Company spent $534.4 million during 2003. Capital expenditures are funded with cash flows from operations. Financing Activities. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected the purchase of Company stock for $945.1 million, repayment of notes and debentures of $771.2 million and the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $472.1 million, including payments of financing costs. In addition, the Company paid $104.6 million in dividends to stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2003. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $736.5 million, net of financing costs, and from the exercise of employee stock options of $263.3 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.0 billion, the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $1.2 billion, and the purchase of Company stock for $1.1 billion. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.3 billion and from the exercise of employee stock options of $357.6 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflected the net repayment of debt for $1.6 billion and the purchase of Company stock for $1.1 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $184.6 million. II 21 In 2004, the declarations of a $.06 per share quarterly dividend would result in an annual payment to Viacoms stockholders of approximately $420 million. On January 28, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $.06 per share quarterly dividend payable April 1, 2004 to Viacoms stockholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2004. Stock Purchase Program During 2003, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 23.6 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $981.4 million under its stock purchase programs, of which $545.3 million was spent in the fourth quarter for 13.3 million shares. As of December 31, 2003 there was approximately $1.9 billion remaining under the current $3.0 billion purchase program. From January 1 through March 10, 2004, the Company purchased an additional 8.2 million shares for approximately $336.6 million. During 2002, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 27.8 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.2 billion under its stock purchase programs, of which $350.7 million was spent in the fourth quarter of 2002 for 8.1 million shares. Acquisitions On May 22, 2003, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central that it did not own for $1.2 billion in cash. Comedy Centrals results have been consolidated as part of Cable Networks, effective from the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of approximately $1.1 billion was allocated to goodwill. The final allocation of the purchase price will be based on comprehensive final evaluations of the fair value of Comedy Centrals assets acquired and liabilities assumed. On May 15, 2002, the Company acquired the assets of KCAL TV Los Angeles for approximately $650 million. During 2002, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% interest in Noggin, the 24 hour digital network for kids that it did not already own for approximately $100 million. Blockbuster acquired the 51% interest that it did not already own in a joint venture in Italy and also acquired a games retailer in the United Kingdom for approximately $82.4 million in the aggregate in 2002.

Total debt of $10.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 was 13.8% and 14.5%, respectively, as a percentage of total capitalization of the Company. The senior debt of Viacom Inc. is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary Viacom International Inc. The senior debt and senior subordinated debt of the Companys wholly owned II 22 subsidiaries, CBS Broadcasting Inc. and Go Outdoor Systems Holdings S.A., respectively, are not guaranteed; the aggregate outstanding amount of such debt at December 31, 2003 was $118.5 million. The Companys total debt presented above includes, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, (i) an aggregate unamortized premium of $41.4 million and $49.5 million and (ii) the net change in the carrying value of the debt relating to fair value swaps of $48.2 million and $86.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the following debt issuances, maturities and redemptions occurred: Debt Issuances May 14, 2003, $300.0 million 4.625% senior notes due 2018 May 14, 2003, $450.0 million 5.50% senior debentures due 2033 August 28, 2002, $600.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2012 April 25, 2002, $700.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2007 Interest on all of the above debt instruments is paid semi annually. Debt Maturities September 1, 2003, 6.875% notes, $275.0 million January 15, 2003, 6.75% senior notes, $333.8 million June 15, 2002, 8.375% notes, $321.8 million January 15, 2002, 7.50% senior notes, $250.0 million January 1, 2002, 7.625% senior notes, $143.0 million Debt Redemptions July 15, 2003, $150.0 million 7.50% senior debentures due 2023 at 103.6% of principal August 1, 2002, $239.5 million 8.25% senior debentures due 2022 at 103.5% of principal June 15, 2002, $2.6 million 8.875% senior subordinated notes due 2007 at 104.4% of principal June 1, 2002, $31.1 million 8.875% senior debentures due 2022 at 104.1% of principal January 15, 2002, $18.7 million 11.375% subordinated exchange debentures due 2009 at 105.7% of principal For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company repurchased approximately $1.0 million and $55.0 million of its debt, respectively. The Companys scheduled maturities of long term debt at face value, excluding commercial paper and capital leases, outstanding at December 31, 2003 were as follows: Year of Maturity 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and thereafter Long term debt $ 126.1 $ 1,472.8 $ 801.7 $ 700.2 $ .2 $ 6,483.6 II 23  Viacom Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2003, the Companys credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, totaled $4.65 billion comprised of a $1.7 billion 364 day revolving facility due February 2004, a $1.45 billion revolving facility due May 2005 and a $1.5 billion revolving facility due March 2006 (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). In February 2004, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion 5 year credit facility which replaced the $1.7 billion and $1.45 billion facilities. The terms and conditions of the $3.0 billion facility are substantially similar to the $1.5 billion facility. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the $3.0 billion and $1.5 billion facilities. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined at the Companys option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Companys senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.41 billion in the aggregate. The facilities contain covenants, which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities. The primary purpose of the credit facilities is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2003, the Company had commercial paper borrowings of $20.0 million under its $4.65 billion commercial paper program. The Companys credit facilities supporting the commercial paper borrowings totaled $4.5 billion in February 2004. Borrowings under the program have maturities of less than a year. At December 31, 2003, the Company had classified approximately $21.6 million of commercial paper and other debt scheduled to mature within the next twelve months as long term debt, reflecting its intent and ability, through the existence of unused revolving credit facilities, to refinance this debt on a long term basis. Blockbuster Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2003, Blockbusters credit agreement (the "Blockbuster Credit Agreement") was comprised of a $600.0 million long term revolver due July 1, 2004 and a $100.0 million term loan due in quarterly installments ending July 1, 2004. Blockbuster had $600.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the long term revolver at December 31, 2003. Interest rates under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement are based on the prime rate in the United States or LIBOR (plus a margin, or "LIBOR spread," based on leverage ratios, which is currently 1.25%) at Blockbusters option at the time of borrowing. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2003 for borrowings under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement was 2.4%. A variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver (0.25% at December 31, 2003). The Blockbuster Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment of dividends, purchase of Blockbusters common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, Blockbuster was in compliance with all covenants under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement. Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company had an aggregate of $1.0 billion and $981.9 million, respectively, outstanding under revolving receivable securitization programs. The programs result in the sale of receivables on a non recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable and debt on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these arrangements because they provide an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from the programs were used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The terms of the revolving securitization II 24 arrangements require that the receivable pools subject to the programs meet certain performance ratios. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization programs. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes that its operating cash flow ($3.5 billion in 2003), cash and cash equivalents ($850.7 million at December 31, 2003), borrowing capacity under committed bank facilities (which consisted of unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.41 billion in the aggregate at December 31, 2003), and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, including commitments and contingencies, capital and investing commitments and its financing requirements for the foreseeable future. The funding for commitments to purchase sports programming rights, television and film operations, and talent contracts will come primarily from cash flow from operations. The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include capital expenditures, share purchases, acquisitions, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activity available to meet these needs. Any net cash funding requirements are financed with short term borrowings (primarily commercial paper) and long term debt. Commercial paper borrowings, which also accommodate day to day changes in funding requirements, are backed by committed bank facilities that may be utilized in the event that commercial paper borrowings are not available. The Companys strong credit position, which is reflected by an A /A3 rating, affords access to the capital markets. The Company anticipates that scheduled debt maturities in 2004 will be funded with cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operating activities. There are no provisions in any of the Companys material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in the Companys debt ratings. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock and warrants of Viacom that may be issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 billion. The registration statement was first declared effective on January 8, 2001. The net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by Viacom for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital and capital expenditures, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. To date, the Company has issued $2.385 billion of securities under the shelf registration statement. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company had a total of $759.8 million of long term debt maturities, redemptions and repurchases and issued $750 million of long term debt. The long term debt issuances maintained the Companys unused borrowing capacity and its financial flexibility. II 25 As of December 31, 2003, the Companys significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and thereafter Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 13,199.2 $ 3,555.8 $ 3,972.2 $ 2,152.2 $ 3,519.0 Operating leases (2) 5,436.8 972.0 1,546.1 1,016.9 1,901.8 Guaranteed minimum franchise payments (3) 1,453.5 424.5 620.3 204.7 204.0 Purchase obligations (4) 1,155.9 758.9 238.2 79.7 79.1 Capital lease obligations (including interest) (5) 508.6 102.2 161.7 116.6 128.1 Long term debt obligations (6) 9,584.6 126.1 2,274.5 700.4 6,483.6 Other long term liabilities (7) 1,763.5 1,458.0 192.1 113.4 (1)Programming and talent commitments of the Company include $8.2 billion for the acquisition of sports programming rights, $3.2 billion relating to television, radio and feature film production and acquisitions and $1.1 billion for talent contracts. (2)Includes long term noncancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3)Viacoms outdoor advertising business has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks and stadium signage. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchiser is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. (4)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (5)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders and buildings. (6)Long term debt obligations are presented at face value. (7)Long term contractual obligations, including program liabilities and participations due to producers and residuals. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements primarily consist of the guarantees described below. Guarantees The Company owns a 50% equity interest in United Cinemas International ("UCI"), which operates movie theaters in Europe, Latin America and Asia. As of December 31, 2003, the Company guaranteed approximately $291.9 million of UCIs debt obligations under a revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2004, and $175.6 million of UCIs theater leases. The Company also owns a 50% interest in WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. and Graumans Theatres LLC and guarantees certain theater leases for approximately $13.2 million. The debt and lease guarantees would only be triggered upon non payment by the respective primary obligors. These guarantees are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. Additionally, the Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $348.0 million at December 31, 2003 and are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. The Company is also subject to certain off balance sheet lease guarantees related to the divestitures of certain businesses. In October 1998, Blockbuster Music stores were sold to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. ("Wherehouse"). Some of the leases transferred in connection with this sale had previously been guaranteed either by the Company or its affiliates. The remaining initial terms of these leases expire on various dates through 2007. However, certain leases contain renewal options that can II 26 extend the primary lease term and remain subject to the guarantee. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to any amount paid under these guarantees. On January 21, 2003, Wherehouse filed a petition for protection under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law. Based on information regarding lease and guaranty expirations originally available to Blockbuster in connection with the Wherehouse bankruptcy, Blockbusters estimated a contingent liability of approximately $36.0 million. Of this amount Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 which represented its estimate of the lease guarantee obligation at that time. During 2003, Blockbuster paid approximately $8.2 million associated with the lease guarantee obligation. As of December 31, 2003, Blockbuster estimated its contingent liability for Wherehouse leases to be approximately $12.6 million. Of this amount Blockbuster determined its reserve to be $7.9 million and as a result Blockbuster reduced its original reserve by $2.6 million. The Company had previously accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations. Legal Matters Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had pending approximately 112,280 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 103,800 as of December 31, 2002 and approximately 106,000 as of December 31, 2001. The 2002 and 2001 numbers of claims included approximately 1,100 claims and 7,100 claims, respectively, on inactive dockets in various states which would not be counted as pending under the Companys current methodology. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2003, approximately 82,340 were pending in state courts, 27,400 in federal court and approximately 2,540 were third party claims. During 2003, the Company received approximately 36,990 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 28,500 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs (recovery) in 2003 and 2002 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $(8.7) million and $28 million, respectively. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. If proceeds received in 2003 from commuted insurance policies were excluded from the Companys total costs in 2003, the Companys total costs after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits would have been $56.6 million. Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos, lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure, other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease. Claims identified as cancer remain a small percentage of asbestos claims II 27 pending at December 31, 2003. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities and that these asbestos liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. Antitrust. In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the Company, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries with respect to a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint included federal antitrust and California state law claims. In August 2003, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal court judgment. The Supreme Court of the United States refused plaintiffs petition for writ of certiorari in March 2004. In February 2003, a similar complaint that had been filed in a Los Angeles County Superior Court was also dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the California state court dismissal, as well as a prior denial of class certification. The Company believes that the plaintiffs positions in these litigations are without merit and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in the litigations. Blockbuster Securities Actions. During February and March 2003, putative class action complaints were filed against Blockbuster in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. A director and certain officers of Blockbuster were also named as defendants. The remaining putative class actions have been consolidated into one action styled In re Blockbuster Inc. Securities Litigation, which is pending in the same court. The consolidated amended complaint, filed July 2003, claims violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the time period approximately between February and December 2002. It also generally alleges that the defendants made untrue statements of material fact and or omitted to disclose material facts about Blockbusters business and operations, that the value of Blockbusters common stock was therefore artificially inflated and that certain of the individual defendants sold shares of Blockbusters common stock at inflated prices. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. In addition, three shareholder derivative actions were filed in February, March and April 2003, of which one is pending in federal court in Texas and two have been consolidated into one action in Texas state court, each arising from substantially similar operative facts. These shareholder derivative actions include claims for breach of fiduciary duties for various time periods beginning in February 2002 and name certain Blockbuster officers and directors, some of whom are directors and or executive officers of the Company, as individual defendants, and Blockbuster as a nominal defendant. The Company and Blockbuster believe the plaintiffs positions in all of these actions are without merit and Blockbuster intends to vigorously defend these matters. Other. In December 2002, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Blockbuster had breached the revenue sharing agreement between the two parties. Buena Vista claims damages in excess of $120 million. Blockbuster has answered and asserted counterclaims for reformation and breach of contract. On July 22, 2003, the California federal court granted Buena Vistas motion for partial summary judgment, stating in its ruling that a liquidated damages provision in the contract is enforceable. The court reaffirmed its ruling when it denied Blockbusters motion for reconsideration in February 2004. Blockbuster has several remaining defenses to the claims asserted by Buena Vista. Blockbuster and the Company believe the plaintiffs position is without merit, and intend to vigorously defend this matter. II 28 Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that all of the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business with companies in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the non designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of "Other items, net". The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2003, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $296.9 million, of which $12.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $284.9 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. At December 31, 2002, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $266.0 million, of which $49.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $217.0 million represented hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is exposed to movements in short term rates. Swap agreements are used to modify this exposure. This includes both fixed to variable rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, and variable to fixed rate swaps, which are designed as cash flow hedges. Based on the amount of variable rate debt and receivable securitization programs outstanding at December 31, 2003, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause a $23.8 million change to pre tax earnings. As of December 31, 2003 if all parties were to agree, the swaps could have been terminated by a net payment from the counterparties of approximately $47.6 million. The Company has entered into cash flow swap agreements which effectively converted variable rate interest payments on commercial paper to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount outstanding relating to these agreements was approximately $19.4 million and the swap agreements mature in September 2004. Interest is received based upon three month LIBOR and is paid at approximately 5.07%. The amount of the ineffectiveness of these cash flow hedges that was reflected in earnings was immaterial. The effective portion of the change in value of cash flow hedges is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During the next twelve months, approximately $.5 million will be amortized into earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedges included in earnings was not material. The change in value of the fair value hedges and the hedged instruments is reported in earnings for the periods presented. II 29 On May 14, 2003, the Company entered into additional $300 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2018 and the Company receives interest at approximately 4.55% and pays three month LIBOR. On April 25, 2002, the Company entered into additional $700 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2007 and the Company receives interest at approximately 5.11% on $400 million and 5.35% on $300 million, and pays three month LIBOR. During December 2001, the Company entered into $750 million notional amount of swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. Of the $750 million notional amount, $225 million received interest at approximately 3.2% and was to mature on January 15, 2003 and $275 million received interest at approximately 3.8% and was to mature on September 1, 2003. These swaps were terminated in November 2002 resulting in the Company receiving $8.7 million in cash which was amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the respective debt. These fair value hedges were fully effective. The remaining $250 million in notional amount matures on June 1, 2005 and receives interest at approximately 4.5%. These fair value hedges are fully effective. All the swaps paid or pay interest based on three month LIBOR. Credit Risk The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. The Companys receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2003 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Companys products and services are sold. Related Parties National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") is a closely held corporation that beneficially owns the Companys Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 71% of the voting power of all classes of the Companys Common Stock, and approximately 11% of the Companys Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis at December 31, 2003. Owners of the Companys Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. The Companys Class B Common Stock does not have voting rights. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios including Paramount Pictures, a division of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, NAI made payments to Paramount Pictures in the aggregate amounts of approximately $9.6 million, $12.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. NAI and Mr. Redstone owned in the aggregate approximately 30% of the common stock of Midway Games Inc. ("Midway") as of December 31, 2003. Midway sells home video games to Blockbuster and also places advertisements on various of the Companys cable networks from time to time. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, transactions with Midway totaled approximately $9.9 million, $12.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively. The Company owns a minority equity interest in Westwood One, Inc. ("Westwood One"). Most of Infinitys radio stations are affiliated with Westwood One, and Westwood One distributes nationally certain of the Companys radio programming. In connection with these arrangements, the Company receives affiliation fees as well as programming cost reimbursements and in certain instances, shares in revenue II 30 from the sale by Westwood One of Infinitys programming. In addition, certain employees of Infinity serve as officers of Westwood One for which the Company receives a management fee. CBS Television and Cable Networks also enter into programming agreements with Westwood One. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $85.5 million, $127.7 million and $104.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Recent Pronouncements In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The adoption of SFAS 150 as of July 1, 2003 did not have any effect on the Companys financial position. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51" which was replaced in December 2003 by the issuance of FIN 46R ("FIN 46R"). FIN 46R explains how to identify variable interest entities ("VIEs") and how a company should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46R requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. The provisions of FIN 46R are effective for special purpose entities (SPEs) as of December 31, 2003. The Company has completed its review of its special purpose entities under FIN 46R and has determined that the application of FIN 46R did not impact the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows. The provisions of FIN 46R must be applied to VIEs as of March 31, 2004. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of the remaining provisions of FIN 46R will have on the Company. Critical Accounting Policies Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates. Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with SOP 00 2, which requires managements judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments. The cost of Blockbusters rental library, which includes videocassettes, DVDs and games, is amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 12 months to an estimated residual value of $2 to $5 per II 31 unit, according to the product category. The estimates for useful lives and residual values of the rental library are continually evaluated based on changes in consumer demand. Changes in demand or buying patterns may impact the carrying value of the rental library and rental margins. During 2001, Blockbuster changed the estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for videocassettes and game products, which resulted in inventory write downs and increased amortization expense. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142 and a non cash charge would be required. Balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to taxes, legal issues, restructuring charges and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments and estimates by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued businesses, including environmental and asbestos are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled. The Company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. For 2003, the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension plans decreased as a result of plan assets producing a return higher than the expected return due to the market conditions in 2003 partially offset by lowering the discount rate for the Companys major plans from 6.5% in 2002 to 6.0% in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the total accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of the corresponding plan assets and therefore, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability of $773.8 million. As of December 31, 2002, such pension liability was $865.0 million. Risk Factors The risk factors listed below, in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report, could affect the business and future results of the Company. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its over the air networks, basic cable networks, television stations, radio stations and outdoor businesses. The sale of advertising is affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising. Adverse changes to any of these factors, including as a result of acts of terrorism or war, could have a negative effect on revenues. II 32 The Companys basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent upon affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home satellite services ("DTH") distributors on acceptable terms. The loss of carriage on such distributors, or continued carriage on less favorable terms, could adversely affect, with respect to basic cable networks, revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising and, with respect to premium subscription television networks, subscriber fee revenues. In addition, continued consolidation among cable and or DTH distributors and vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business, could have an adverse effect on subscriber fees and advertising revenues, as the Companys ability to launch new networks or maintain or obtain additional distribution for existing networks is impacted by these factors. Operating results derived from the Companys motion picture and television production businesses fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public, which are difficult to predict. Motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent, reduced availability of co financing opportunities, and other factors have resulted in higher production costs. In addition, the commercial success of the Companys motion picture and television productions depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions, and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142 and a non cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a significant effect on the Companys reported net earnings. The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized pursuing the divestiture of Viacoms approximately 81.5% interest in Blockbuster, and the Company, while continuing to consider other alternatives, anticipates that the divestiture would be achieved through a tax free split off. The Company may determine, for market or other reasons, not to effectuate the divestiture of Blockbuster, or a split off of Blockbuster, if it does occur, may be taxable. In addition, should the Company complete a divestiture of Blockbuster, if the fair value of Blockbuster at the date of divestiture were below book value, a loss would be recognized. Such a loss could have a significant effect on the Companys reported net earnings. While the Company seeks to ensure compliance with FCC indecency laws and regulations, the definition of "indecency" is subject to interpretation and there can be no assurance that employees of the Company will not make decisions resulting in the broadcast of programming that does not meet such standards. Such programming could subject the Company to regulatory review or investigation, fines, adverse publicity or other sanctions including the loss of station licenses. Technology developments, including digital copying and file compression, and the growing penetration of high bandwidth Internet connections, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. The Company takes actions to vigorously enforce its rights and protect its copyrighted materials and products, however there can be no assurance that it will be successful in preventing the distribution of pirated content. Increased piracy of the Companys copyrighted materials could negatively affect its operations and financial results. Advances in technologies such as personal video recorders and video on demand and changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these or other technologies could have an adverse effect on the Companys businesses, particularly its television and video businesses. II 33 The Company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued businesses, including environmental liabilities, liabilities related to illnesses of former employees and other pending and threatened litigation. While the pending or threatened litigations and environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance in this regard. The Companys home video retail business currently enjoys a competitive advantage over most other movie distribution channels, except theatrical releases, due to the early timing of the video retailer "distribution window." The video business could be negatively affected if the video retail distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release; the length of the video retail distribution window were shortened; or the video retail distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now. The Company believes that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable video retail industry; however, the order, length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie and the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of any future decisions by the studios. Increased studio licensing of product to video on demand and similar services might impact their decisions with respect to the timing and exclusivity of the video retailer distribution window with possible adverse effect on the Video business. The Company cannot control or predict with certainty studio pricing policies for DVD and VHS product. Current studio policies reducing the pricing of movies released to DVDs and an increasing percentage of VHS titles allow for an affordable sales price by the retailer to the consumer from the beginning of the home video distribution window. This lower "sell through" pricing has led to increased competition from other retailers, including mass merchants and online retailers who are able to purchase DVDs for sale to consumers at the same time as traditional video retailers purchase both DVDs and videocassettes for rental. If sell through pricing, increased competition and consumer interest in building personal DVD libraries cause consumers to increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies, the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to increase rental market share, to replace profits from rentals with profits from sales of sell through product, or to otherwise positively affect gross profits. In addition, if studios make future changes in their pricing policies, which could include pricing rental windows for DVDs or expanded exploitation by studios of any international copyright laws that allow studios to charge retailers more for DVD and VHS rental product than for sell through product, the profitability of the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to enter into arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations. The Companys operating results fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases, as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition. NAI, through its ownership of the Companys Class A common stock, has voting control of the Company. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require shareholder approval, including the election of directors, issuance of securities and transactions involving a change of control. During 2003, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with each of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer which addresses the specific responsibilities of each position. There can be no assurance that either of these executives will remain with the Company for the full term of his employment agreement. A departure of either of these executives, or of other key executives of the Company, could have an adverse effect on the Company. In the operation of its businesses, the Company engages the services of writers, directors, actors and others, which are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages and or higher costs in connection with these agreements could adversely impact the Companys operations. II 34 Changes in laws and regulations, including in particular FCC ownership and indecency rules, could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the operations and ownership of the Companys properties. Some of the Companys businesses are seasonal. The home video rental and retail business and the consumer publishing business are subject to increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays, while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is generated from May through September. In addition, the home video and theme parks businesses revenues are influenced by weather. The Companys radio and outdoor advertising businesses experience fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers. These risk factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the Company. Other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors also could have material adverse effects on the Companys future results.

The Company maintains its world headquarters at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York, where it rents approximately 1.2 million square feet for executive offices and certain of its operating divisions. The lease for the majority of the space runs to 2010, with four renewal options for five years each thereafter. The Company also leases the following major facilities in New York City for certain of its operating divisions: (a) approximately 548,000 square feet of office space at 1633 Broadway, New York, New York, which lease runs to 2010, and (b) approximately 237,000 square feet of office space at 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, which lease runs to 2009.

The Company considers its properties adequate for its present needs. I 40 Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had pending approximately 112,280 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 103,800 as of December 31, 2002 and approximately 106,000 as of December 31, 2001. The 2002 and 2001 numbers of claims included approximately 1,100 claims and 7,100 claims, respectively, on inactive dockets in various states which would not be counted as pending under the Companys current methodology. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2003, approximately 82,340 were pending in state courts, 27,400 in federal court and approximately 2,540 were third party claims. During 2003, the Company received approximately 36,990 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 28,500 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs (recovery) in 2003 and 2002 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $(8.7) million and $28 million, respectively. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. If proceeds received in 2003 from commuted insurance policies were excluded from the Companys total costs in 2003, the Companys total costs after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits would have been $56.6 million. Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos, lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure, other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease. Claims identified as cancer remain a small percentage of asbestos claims pending at December 31, 2003. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities and that these asbestos liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. Antitrust. In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the Company, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries with I 41 respect to a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint included federal antitrust and California state law claims. In August 2003, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal court judgment. The Supreme Court of the United States refused plaintiffs petition for writ of certiorari in March 2004. In February 2003, a similar complaint that had been filed in a Los Angeles County Superior Court was also dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the California state court dismissal, as well as a prior denial of class certification. The Company believes that the plaintiffs positions in these litigations are without merit and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in the litigations. Blockbuster Securities Actions. During February and March 2003, putative class action complaints were filed against Blockbuster in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. A director and certain officers of Blockbuster were also named as defendants. The remaining putative class actions have been consolidated into one action styled In re Blockbuster Inc. Securities Litigation, which is pending in the same court. The consolidated amended complaint, filed July 2003, claims violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the time period approximately between February and December 2002. It also generally alleges that the defendants made untrue statements of material fact and or omitted to disclose material facts about Blockbusters business and operations, that the value of Blockbusters common stock was therefore artificially inflated and that certain of the individual defendants sold shares of Blockbusters common stock at inflated prices. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. In addition, three shareholder derivative actions were filed in February, March and April 2003, of which one is pending in federal court in Texas and two have been consolidated into one action in Texas state court, each arising from substantially similar operative facts. These shareholder derivative actions include claims for breach of fiduciary duties for various time periods beginning in February 2002 and name certain Blockbuster officers and directors, some of whom are directors and or executive officers of the Company, as individual defendants, and Blockbuster as a nominal defendant. The Company and Blockbuster believe the plaintiffs positions in all of these actions are without merit and Blockbuster intends to vigorously defend these matters. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that all of the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Cable Networks contributed 21% to consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. TELEVISION: The Television segment consists of the CBS and UPN television networks, the Companys 39 owned broadcast television stations, and its television production and syndication business, including KING WORLD PRODUCTIONS and PARAMOUNT TELEVISION.

Video contributed 22%, 23% and 22%, respectively, to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. II 3 On February 10, 2004, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the Company to pursue the divestiture of Viacoms approximately 81.5% interest in Blockbuster, based on the conclusion that Blockbuster would be better positioned as a company completely independent of Viacom. The Company anticipates that the divestiture would be achieved through a tax free split off, but will also continue to consider other alternatives. The transaction is subject to further approval of the Viacom Board and an assessment of market conditions. The split off, which would result in a reduction of Viacoms outstanding shares, is expected to be completed by mid 2004. Consolidated Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 and 2002 vs. 2001 Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2003, revenues of $26.6 billion increased 8% from $24.6 billion in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, revenues of $24.6 billion increased 6% from $23.2 billion in 2001. Revenue growth for each year primarily reflected increases in advertising sales, rental/retail sales and affiliate fees, along with continuing contributions from feature film exploitation. The table below presents the Companys consolidated revenues by type and the percentage and amount of contribution of each type of revenue to consolidated revenues, net of intercompany eliminations, for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues by Type Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Advertising sales $ 12,071.9 45 % $ 11,225.1 46 % $ 10,722.8 46 % Rental/retail sales 5,815.1 22 5,480.1 22 5,049.9 22 Affiliate fees 2,407.7 9 2,199.0 9 2,030.9 9 Feature film exploitation 2,212.4 8 1,860.0 7 1,853.6 8 TV license fees 1,514.5 6 1,472.2 6 1,359.2 6 Other 2,563.7 10 2,369.3 10 2,206.4 9 Total Revenues $ 26,585.3 100 % $ 24,605.7 100 % $ 23,222.8 100 % Advertising sales, which represented 45% of the Companys consolidated revenues for 2003, increased 8% in 2003 to $12.1 billion reflecting growth in all of the Companys segments which generate advertising revenues: Cable Networks, Television, Radio and Outdoor. The increase in advertising revenues was due to increased units sold and higher rates at the cable and broadcast networks and 7% higher U.S. billboard and 17% higher European outdoor revenues primarily driven by favorable exchange rates. For 2002, advertising sales increased 5% to $11.2 billion led by increases in Cable Networks, Television and Radio. The 2002 increase in advertising revenues was driven primarily by increased units sold at cable networks, as well as increases in average unit rates and units sold at the broadcast network operations. Rental/retail sales for 2003 were up 6% to $5.8 billion reflecting a 26% increase in retail sales and a 2% increase in rental sales. Both rental and retail growth were driven by an increase of 198 worldwide company operated stores since December 31, 2002, the acquisition of GameStation, Inc., a leading games retailer in the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of 2002 and favorable foreign exchange rates. Worldwide same store revenues declined 2.2% reflecting a 3.6% decline in same store rental revenues as a result of a weaker rental market worldwide partially offset by an increase in same store retail revenues of 3.7% reflecting growth in both movie and games sales. Rental/retail sales for 2002 were up 9% to $5.5 billion with rental sales growth of 3% and retail sales growth of 39% driven by an increase of 495 worldwide company operated stores since December 31, 2001 and increased DVD and game product sales. Affiliate fees for 2003 increased 9% to $2.4 billion primarily driven by rate increases and growth in subscriber volume at MTVN as well as the acquisition of Comedy Central in May 2003. Affiliate fees for II 4 2002 increased 8% to $2.2 billion reflecting rate increases at each of the Cable Networks as well as an increase in subscriber volume at MTV Networks digital channels. Feature film revenues increased 19% to $2.2 billion in 2003 primarily reflecting 62% higher worldwide home entertainment revenues from DVD sales and contributions from increased syndication, theatrical and pay television revenues partially offset by lower network revenues. Feature film revenues remained relatively flat in 2002 versus 2001 at $1.9 billion reflecting growth in DVD sales primarily offset by lower theatrical revenues. Television license fees increased 3% to $1.5 billion in 2003 principally reflecting increased syndication revenues due to a full year of results for THE DR. PHIL SHOW versus four months in 2002. Television license fee revenues increased 8% in 2002 to $1.5 billion primarily from increased syndication revenues from cable sales and revenues from THE DR. PHIL SHOW, launched in 2002. Other revenues, which include revenues from publishing, theme park operations, movie theaters and consumer products, increased 8% to $2.6 billion in 2003 primarily reflecting higher Nickelodeon consumer products revenues as well as higher theaters revenues from favorable foreign currency translation, higher admission prices and increased per capita spending. For 2002, other revenues increased 7% to $2.4 billion primarily due to higher publishing, theaters and Nickelodeon consumer products revenues. The Companys 2004 revenues are expected to benefit from the continued strengthening of the advertising market and from the Super Bowl telecast on CBS in February, as well as the full year impact of the Comedy Central acquisition. Assuming the divestiture of Blockbuster occurs, the Companys advertising supported businesses as a percentage of consolidated revenues would significantly increase. International Revenues The Company generated approximately 18% of its total revenues from international regions in 2003 and 16% in 2002 and 2001, principally from Europe and Canada. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Europe $ 2,839.8 58 % $ 2,263.4 56 % $ 2,030.6 54 % Canada 1,087.1 22 927.2 23 881.7 23 All other 960.1 20 838.6 21 844.0 23 Total International Revenues $ 4,887.0 100 % $ 4,029.2 100 % $ 3,756.3 100 % Operating Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2003, operating expenses of $16.3 billion increased 9% over 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, operating expenses of $14.9 billion increased 3% over 2001. The major components and changes in operating expenses were as follows: Production and program rights amortization expenses represented approximately 47% of total operating expenses in 2003 and reflect the costs and amortization of television and theatrical inventory, including direct production costs, residuals and participation expenses, production overhead and acquisition costs as well as costs attributable to television and radio programming expenses including on air talent and other production costs, and costs and amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast networks, cable networks and broadcast stations. For 2003, production and program rights amortization increased 11% over 2002 primarily due to 22% higher costs at Cable Networks, principally for new and existing programming at MTVN. Also contributing to the increases were higher costs for contractual series at the broadcast networks and more original summer programming, higher sports rights amortization at CBS Network and Radio II 5 and higher feature film amortization. Production and program rights amortization expenses for 2002 increased 4% over 2001 driven by contractual increases in costs associated with series at the broadcast networks and increases at the Company owned television stations due to new entertainment and sports programming investments. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses represented approximately 27% of total operating expenses in 2003 and include amortization of the costs of videocassette, DVD and game inventory, revenue sharing expenses on rental inventory, store employee compensation expense and occupancy expenses. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2003 increased 6% over 2002 reflecting an increase in rental/retail sales of 6%, an increase of 198 worldwide company operated stores partially offset by improved product buying and inventory management. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2002 increased 1% over 2001 reflecting a shift in product mix and the net increase of 495 worldwide company operated stores, partially offset by the 2001 charge associated with Blockbusters re merchandising and store reconfiguration plans. Distribution expenses, which represented approximately 9% of total operating expenses in 2003, reflect advertising and other distribution costs incurred primarily with respect to theatrical and television product. Distribution expenses for 2003 increased 11% over 2002 reflecting higher print and advertising costs for feature films in theatrical release. Distribution expenses for 2002 increased 8% over 2001 reflecting higher costs associated with prints and advertising due to the higher number of feature films released partially offset by a decrease in other distribution costs. Other operating expenses for 2003, included an increase in Outdoor expenses of 7%, reflecting higher rotation and embellishment expenses for billboards. Outdoor expenses for 2002 increased 10% over 2001 reflecting higher guarantee payments for transit contracts. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, which include expenses incurred to provide back office support, occupancy, selling and marketing costs, increased 4% to $4.4 billion in 2003 reflecting increased costs from Comedy Central, acquired in May 2003, increased employee related expenses and higher directors and officers insurance premiums and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a pre tax gain of $40 million received in 2003 from the settlement of a 2001 physical damage and business interruption claim. For 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $4.2 billion. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 16% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 17% for 2002 and 18% for 2001. Advertising expenses remained relatively flat at $1.4 billion for 2003 and 2002 reflecting higher advertising costs for feature films in theatrical release offset by decreases at Blockbuster. Advertising expenses decreased 5% in 2002 versus 2001 reflecting lower advertising spending at the broadcast and cable networks and Company owned television stations partially offset by increases at Blockbuster for marketing efforts associated with key rental and retail promotions. Included within selling, general and administrative expenses are residual costs, which primarily include pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. Residual costs for 2003 increased to $146.5 million from $67.8 million principally due to actuarial losses from a lower discount rate and a decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets in 2003. Residual costs decreased to $67.8 million in 2002 from $87.2 million in 2001 due primarily to the recognition of actuarial gains for benefit plans of certain divested businesses. II 6 Impairment and Restructuring Charges During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non cash impairment charge related to Blockbuster of approximately $1.3 billion in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. In completing its analysis of the fair value of the video business during the fourth quarter of 2003, several events led Blockbuster to conclude that the business had incremental risks that were required to be included in its evaluation of goodwill. These events included Blockbusters lower than anticipated same store revenues during the December 2003 selling season caused by increased competition from retail DVD and other home video distribution channels. Blockbuster also identified risks associated with certain international operations, such as increased competition, two tiered pricing and piracy. Additionally, Blockbusters review of long lived assets in conjunction with SFAS 144 resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $18.5 million to reduce the carrying value of certain fixed assets in four international markets. These charges were included in "Impairment and restructuring charges" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, restructuring charges of $26.4 million were recorded at Cable Networks. These charges principally reflected $17.7 million of severance liabilities resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Comedy Central that the Company did not own and organizational changes at Showtime Networks Inc. Also included in this total was $8.4 million for additional lease termination costs for MTVN due to a change in the initial estimate for its 2001 charge. In 2001, the Company recorded a Cable Networks restructuring charge of $66.6 million for MTVN and a UPN restructuring charge of $52.8 million. These charges were principally associated with reducing headcount and closing certain MTVN domestic and foreign offices and integrating UPN into CBS Network operations. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and amortization increased 6% to $999.8 million principally driven by an increase of 198 company operated video stores and the addition of broadcasting equipment and outdoor advertising properties. For the year ended December 31, 2002, depreciation and amortization decreased to $945.6 million as compared with $3.1 billion for 2001. This decrease was due to the Companys initial adoption of SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002, and as a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense decreased 9% to $776.0 million from $848.3 million primarily due to a reduction in debt including lower average commercial paper borrowings. The Company had approximately $10.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at weighted average interest rates of 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense decreased 12% to $848.3 million from $969.2 million due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates. The Company had approximately $11.5 billion at December 31, 2001 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at a weighted average interest rate of 6.8%. Interest Income For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest income decreased to $14.8 million from $15.8 million in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest income decreased to $15.8 million from $30.6 million in 2001 due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in 2002 versus 2001. II 7 Other Items, Net For the year ended December 31, 2003, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $3.4 million principally consisting of foreign exchange losses of $2.3 million, losses associated with securitizing trade receivables of $14.8 million and an aggregate loss of $7.0 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value, partially offset by a net gain on the disposition of investments of $14.8 million and an insurance recoupment of $5.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $30.0 million which principally consisted of foreign exchange losses of $51.9 million, losses of $19.7 million associated with securitizing trade receivables and an aggregate loss of approximately $13.8 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value. These losses were partially offset by the recovery of advertising commitments of $29.8 million, a gain of $18.8 million on the sale of a telephone kiosk advertising business and a net gain of $5.5 million from the sale of investments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, "Other items, net" of $254.7 million principally reflected a gain from television station swaps of $210.1 million and the recovery of certain advertising commitments of $250.0 million offset by impairment losses of approximately $125.0 million related to the Companys investments. The one time pre tax gains were also partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $8.2 million and losses of $22.8 million associated with securitizing trade receivables. Additionally, 2001 reflects an impairment loss of $46.6 million related to the purchase of two television stations. The recovery of advertising commitments in 2002 and 2001 reflected the restructuring of agreements with several Internet companies. As a result, the Company was released from related advertising commitments and reversed related deferred revenues. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. For 2003, the annual effective tax rate, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting was 55.9% in 2003, 38.8% in 2002 and 118.5% in 2001. The annual 2003 rate was adversely affected by the non cash charge recorded to reduce the carrying value of Blockbuster goodwill. Excluding the non cash charge, the annual effective tax rate was 39.8% in 2003. The annual 2001 rate was adversely affected by non deductible goodwill amortization. Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $.6 million for 2003, $39.5 million for 2002 and $127.0 million for 2001. The amounts principally reflected operating losses from Internet investments and international ventures partially offset by positive results of Westwood One and Comedy Central prior to its acquisition in May 2003. Additionally, 2001 reflected operating losses from Internet equity investments that were no longer operating in 2002. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest for 2003 and 2002 primarily represented the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Minority interest increased in 2003 principally due to recording the minority interest portion of the 2003 Blockbuster non cash charge. Minority interest for 2001 primarily represented the minority ownership of Infinity prior to its merger with the Company on February 21, 2001, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest and Tax Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which requires the capitalization of asset retirement costs as part of the total cost of the II 8 related long lived asset and the depreciation of this cost over the corresponding assets useful life. As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded a charge of $18.5 million, or $.01 per share, reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142 and recorded an after tax non cash charge of $1.5 billion (net of minority interest of $336.1 million), or $.84 per basic and $.83 per diluted share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net Earnings (Loss) The Company reported net earnings of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 versus net earnings of $725.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a net loss of $223.5 million for 2001. The improvement in net earnings in 2003 was primarily due to revenue growth from increases in advertising, feature film exploitation, rental/retail sales and affiliate fees and the non cash impairment charge of $1.5 billion recorded in 2002 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax. These increases were partially offset by the non cash Blockbuster charge of $1.0 billion, net of minority interest and tax, recorded in 2003 and increases in operating expenses primarily from programming and production costs. The substantial improvement in 2002 over 2001 reflected revenue growth principally from advertising sales and the reduction of amortization expense resulting from the implementation of SFAS 142 partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2002.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 5,645.5 $ 4,726.7 $ 4,297.6 Operating income (OI) $ 2,172.3 $ 1,772.2 $ 1,234.9 OI as a % of revenues 38% 37% 29% Depreciation and amortization $ 195.3 $ 190.9 $ 447.1 Capital expenditures $ 90.3 $ 95.7 $ 139.9 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Cable Networks revenues increased 19% to $5.6 billion principally driven by 26% growth in advertising revenues and a 9% increase in affiliate fees. Approximately 9% of Cable Networks revenues were generated from international regions, of which approximately 68% came from Europe. Comedy Centrals results have been consolidated in this segment as part of MTVN effective from the date of its acquisition on May 22, 2003. For 2003, advertising revenues increased 26% reflecting 27% growth at MTVN principally due to selling more units and higher average unit rates. BET delivered 17% advertising revenue growth for 2003 over the prior year as a result of higher average rates. The 9% increase in affiliate fees was primarily due to rate and subscriber increases at MTVN and BET partially offset by declines at SNI. Other ancillary revenues for Cable Networks, which represented 9% of revenues for 2003 and 8% for 2002, grew 40% reflecting higher consumer product licensing revenues at Nickelodeon and contributions from co produced feature films. Cable Networks revenue growth benefited from Comedy Central contributions of 8% to advertising, 3% to affiliate and 5% to ancillary revenue growth for the year. During the second quarter of 2003, restructuring charges of $26.4 million were recorded at Cable Networks. These charges principally reflected $17.7 million of severance liabilities resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central that the Company did not own and organizational changes at SNI. Also included in this total was $8.4 million for additional lease termination costs for MTVN due to a change in the initial estimate for its 2001 charge. For 2003, Cable Networks operating income increased 23% reflecting higher revenues partially offset by increased expenses. Operating expenses, principally comprised of programming and production costs for the cable channels, increased 23%, led by increases at MTVN and BET primarily for new programming initiatives and the impact of Comedy Central. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% primarily due to higher marketing costs at MTVN and the inclusion of Comedy Central, which contributed 5% of the increase. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved one percentage point for the year. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% to $4.7 billion principally driven by 12% growth in advertising revenues and 8% growth in affiliate fees. MTVNs advertising revenues increased 11% due to selling more units, partially offset by a reduction of average unit rates. Cable affiliate fees increased 8% II 11 principally due to mid single digit rate increases at MTVNs domestic channels, excluding digital, an 18% increase in domestic subscribers principally due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Noggin and the expansion of MTVN digital channels and mid single digit average rate increases at SNI. Other ancillary revenues were principally comprised of consumer product licensing revenues from Nickelodeon. For 2002, Cable Networks operating income increased 44% as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The increase also reflected the impact of the MTVN charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The MTVN charge reflected $66.6 million for severance due to a reduction in workforce and for lease termination costs. In conjunction with the restructuring, $8.8 million was recorded as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. Operating expenses increased 7% principally driven by higher programming costs at MTV, Nickelodeon, Spike TV and SNI. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% primarily due to higher compensation expense from sales commissions as a result of revenue growth. Television (CBS and UPN Television Networks and Stations; Television Production and Syndication) (Contributed 29% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, 30% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 31% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 7,761.0 $ 7,456.8 $ 7,218.7 Operating income (OI) $ 1,238.1 $ 1,177.6 $ 385.8 OI as a % of revenues 16% 16% 5% Depreciation and amortization $ 151.1 $ 140.8 $ 786.4 Capital expenditures $ 123.6 $ 138.7 $ 120.2 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Television revenues increased 4% to $7.8 billion primarily driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, and higher syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 6%, with 8% growth in CBS primetime due primarily to a 6% average rate increase. Late night, daytime and news advertising revenues were up with average rate increases partially offset by a rate decrease at sports, due primarily to the impact of the war on the broadcast of the NCAA basketball tournament. The Stations group delivered 2% year over year advertising revenue growth led by ratings improvements for the CBS Network, particularly at 10 pm, which improved the stations local news and syndication as well as higher sales in the automotive, leisure and media industries. The Stations group also benefited from the full year results of KCAL TV Los Angeles, acquired in May 2002, which contributed 3% to the revenue growth for the year. These increases were more than offset by the absence of political advertising which was down over 80% versus the prior year. Higher syndication revenues for the year were partially offset by a decrease in domestic syndication availabilities and home entertainment revenues. Syndication revenues were higher primarily due to increases in license fees and barter revenues for THE DR. PHIL SHOW which debuted in September 2002 and higher barter revenues from EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. Revenue from domestic syndication availabilities in 2003 included THE PARKERS, SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH and the off network syndication of seasons one through five of BECKER, and did not match last years initial basic cable syndication availabilities including 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED and SEVEN DAYS. Home entertainment revenues decreased as contributions from the DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE did not match the contributions from last years DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. II 12 For 2003, Television operating income increased 5% principally due to the revenue increases noted above. Operating expenses, principally comprised of production costs and programming expenses, increased 5% for the year. CBS Network experienced higher programming costs due to more hours of original summer programming, contractual series increases in primetime and increased sports rights payments which were associated with the first year of new contracts with both the NCAA and the PGA Tour. The Stations group incurred higher operating expenses for the year principally due to expansion of news coverage and talent partially offset by reduced advertising and promotion. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, remained flat. Television operating income for 2003 included approximately $27 million from insurance recoveries. License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $634.9 million and $668.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including intercompany revenues of $345.2 million and $366.8 million. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Television revenues increased 3% to $7.5 billion principally driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, partially offset by lower syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 2%, with 9% growth for both CBS and UPN in primetime due to 5% average rate increases, partially offset by rate decreases in daytime and news dayparts. CBS Network had additional units available for sale in 2002 versus the prior year when there were fewer units available as a result of the events of September 11, during which CBS ran sustained news coverage from September 11 through September 14, 2001. CBS Network sold approximately 85% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2002/2003 season versus 65% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2001/2002 season. The revenue increases were partially offset by the absence of the Super Bowl, which CBS televised in 2001. The Stations group delivered 12% year over year advertising revenue growth led by increased political ads and higher sales in the automotive and services industries. The acquisition of KCAL TV Los Angeles in May 2002 contributed 5% of the Stations group revenue growth for the year. For 2002, Television revenues also reflected a decrease in domestic and foreign syndication revenues and lower network revenues, partially offset by higher home entertainment revenues. Domestic syndication revenues included revenues from the initial availability to cable of 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED, SISTER, SISTER, and ANY DAY NOW as well as higher library revenues from THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW and HAPPY DAYS. However, these revenues did not match the absence of contributions from the syndication of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and CHEERS in the prior year and license fees from cancelled series including STAR TREK: VOYAGER, DR. LAURA and REAL TV. Foreign syndication revenues were lower primarily resulting from lower current series revenues partially offset by higher revenues from library product. Network revenues decreased as revenues from new series in the 2002/2003 season were more than offset by the absence of revenues from canceled series. Home entertainment revenues were higher primarily from the DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. For 2002, Television operating income increased to $1.2 billion from $385.8 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The increase also reflected the impact of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations. Production and programming expenses at the broadcast networks increased 1.5%, principally reflecting higher costs in primetime due to contractual series increases and higher sports rights offset by lower NFL costs due to the absence of the Super Bowl in 2002. The Stations group incurred higher costs for syndicated programming and sports rights. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. II 13 Radio (Radio Stations) (Contributed 8% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 2,097.6 $ 2,121.6 $ 2,014.8 Operating income (OI) $ 975.0 $ 1,007.6 $ 382.4 OI as a % of revenues 46% 47% 19% Depreciation and amortization $ 27.4 $ 30.8 $ 608.0 Capital expenditures $ 14.1 $ 14.4 $ 12.4 2003 vs. 2002 Radio revenues are generated from 185 domestic radio stations. For 2003, Radio revenues of $2.1 billion reflected a 1% increase in advertising revenues primarily from national sales. The advertising revenue growth was more than offset by lower ancillary revenues principally related to management services provided to Westwood One, an affiliated company. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For 2003, Radio operating income decreased 3% principally due to the revenue decrease and an increase in expenses. Operating expenses, primarily comprised of radio programming expenses including on air talent, program rights amortization and other production costs, increased 7% for the year primarily reflecting contractual talent increases as well as increased sports rights. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3%, reflecting $13 million of insurance recoveries and lower advertising and promotional expenditures for the year. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased one percentage point. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Radio revenues increased 5% to $2.1 billion. Advertising revenues increased 5% driven by an increase in spots sold for the year, with average spot rates increasing slightly. Radio also experienced an increase in ancillary revenues principally related to management services provided to Westwood One. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Radio operating income increased to $1.0 billion from $382 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, offset by incremental expenses associated with acquired sports rights. Outdoor (Outdoor Advertising Properties) (Contributed 7% of consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 1,748.3 $ 1,633.5 $ 1,656.6 Operating income (loss) (OI) $ 207.9 $ 218.0 $ (90.6 ) OI as a % of revenues 12% 13% NM Depreciation and amortization $ 215.9 $ 205.6 $ 617.9 Capital expenditures $ 58.1 $ 67.1 $ 86.9 NM Not meaningful II 14 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Outdoor revenues increased 7% to $1.7 billion reflecting a 17% increase from its European properties and a 2% increase in North America. Revenue growth from its European properties was principally driven by favorable foreign exchange rates. North American results reflected higher revenues from U.S. billboards, driven by an increase in the number of displays, partially offset by lower revenues from the U.S. transit business, due to a decrease in the number of displays and in the average per unit rate, and lower revenues from billboards in Mexico. Approximately 43% of Outdoor revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe, in 2003 compared with 41% in 2002. For 2003, Outdoor operating income decreased 5% to $207.9 million as the revenue increase was more than offset by a 9% increase in total expenses principally due to higher billboard lease costs and sales related expenses as well as in transit guarantees and posting rotation expenses due to shorter campaigns. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased one percentage point for the year. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Outdoor revenues decreased 1% to $1.6 billion due to weakness in the outdoor advertising market during the first half of 2002. The decline in revenues reflected a 5% decrease in domestic revenues, partially offset by a 4% increase in revenues from its European properties. Approximately 41% and 40% of Outdoors revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe, for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Outdoor operating income for 2002 increased to $218.0 million from an operating loss of $90.6 million, as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Operating income also reflected higher guarantee payments on transit contracts in 2002 versus 2001. Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; Consumer Publishing as well as the operation of Theme Parks, Movie Theaters and Music Publishing) (Contributed 15% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and 16% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 4,101.3 $ 3,680.1 $ 3,626.8 Operating income (OI) $ 271.4 $ 358.3 $ 215.3 OI as a % of revenues 7% 10% 6% Depreciation and amortization $ 129.7 $ 120.7 $ 182.8 Capital expenditures $ 66.4 $ 74.6 $ 54.9 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Entertainment revenues increased 11% to $4.1 billion principally reflecting higher Features, Theaters and Consumer Publishing revenues. Approximately 37% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were higher principally due to increased worldwide home entertainment, theatrical and pay television revenues, partially offset by lower network revenues. Worldwide home entertainment revenues included contributions from THE ADVENTURES OF INDIANA JONES THE COMPLETE DVD MOVIE COLLECTION, HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS, THE ITALIAN JOB and LARA CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE. Domestic theatrical revenues were lower than the prior year due in part to fewer titles in domestic theatrical release. Foreign theatrical revenues were higher than the prior year primarily due to contributions from HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS, LARA II 15 CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE and THE ITALIAN JOB. Pay television revenues were higher while network revenues were lower compared to the prior year, both reflecting a change in the mix of titles available. Theaters revenues increased 12% principally due to the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation, higher average admission prices and increased per capita spending, which more than offset a decline in attendance. Parks revenues increased slightly for the year primarily due to a 1% increase in average per capita spending and the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 2% decline in attendance. Publishing revenues increased 3% on the strength of its top selling titles for the year which included "THE ULTIMATE WEIGHT SOLUTION" by Dr. Phil McGraw, "LIVING HISTORY" by Hillary Rodham Clinton and "THE DARK TOWER V (WOLVES OF THE CALLA)" by Stephen King. For 2003, Entertainment operating income decreased 24% to $271.4 million, as the revenue increases noted above were more than offset by increased Features distribution and film amortization costs. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased three percentage points. License fees for television exhibition of completed motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $1.2 and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including intercompany revenues of $281.1 million and $303.7 million. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $3.7 billion principally reflecting higher Publishing, Theaters and Features revenues, partially offset by lower Parks revenues. Approximately 33% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were slightly higher principally due to higher network television, domestic home video, domestic syndication and pay television revenues, which were partially offset by lower worldwide theatrical, foreign syndication, foreign pay television and foreign home video revenues. Domestic theatrical revenues primarily included contributions from the theatrical release of THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, WE WERE SOLDIERS, JACKASS THE MOVIE, CHANGING LANES and STAR TREK NEMESIS. Worldwide home video revenues were higher than last years revenues including contributions from VANILLA SKY, JIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS and WE WERE SOLDIERS. Worldwide home video revenues included increases from the growth in demand for current releases and library titles in the DVD format and an overall decline in the demand for the VHS format. Theaters revenues increased 7% due to higher average admission prices, higher attendance and increased per capita concession spending. Attendance in 2002 increased 3% compared with the prior year. Average admission prices and per capita concession spending both increased 5% over the prior year. Publishing revenues increased 4% primarily due to income from new distribution agreements and higher sales in the Adult Group and Childrens Book and Audio Divisions. The top selling titles for 2002 included "FROM A BUICK 8" by Stephen King, "SELF MATTERS" by Dr. Phil McGraw and "EVERYTHINGS EVENTUAL" also by Stephen King. II 16  For 2002, Entertainment operating income increased 66% to $358.3 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Operating income benefited from the revenue increases noted above and from lower development and overhead costs at Features and lower depreciation expense at Theaters. Video (Home videocassette, DVD and video game rental and retail operations) (Contributed 22% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, 23% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 22% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 5,911.7 $ 5,565.9 $ 5,156.7 Operating income (OI) $ (847.8 ) $ 355.8 $ (219.6 ) OI as a % of revenues NM 6% NM Depreciation and amortization $ 257.9 $ 233.8 $ 423.7 Capital expenditures $ 176.8 $ 140.6 $ 93.1 NM Not meaningful 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Video revenues increased 6% to $5.9 billion as a result of growth in rental and retail revenues. International revenues accounted for 26% of total revenues with 62% from Europe and 20% from Canada. The following is a summary of revenues by category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Rental $ 4,533.5 77 % $ 4,460.4 80 % $ 4,314.7 84 % Retail 1,281.6 22 1,019.7 18 735.2 14 Other 96.6 1 85.8 2 106.8 2 Total revenues $ 5,911.7 100 % $ 5,565.9 100 % $ 5,156.7 100 % The increase in revenues was primarily due to a net increase of 198 company operated stores, favorable exchange rates and the fourth quarter of 2002 acquisitions of GameStation, Inc., a leading games retailer in the United Kingdom, and the remaining interest in joint venture stores in Italy. Worldwide same store revenues decreased 2.2% as a result of a 3.6% decrease in worldwide same store rental revenues, partially offset by a 3.7% increase in worldwide same store retail revenues. The decline in worldwide same store rental revenues was primarily the result of a weaker market worldwide. While the rental market slowed during 2003, retail demand for DVDs and games continued to increase and Blockbuster capitalized on this growth during the first half of 2003. The growth in same store retail revenues slowed during the second half of 2003 as Blockbuster competed against strong same store sales growth in the prior year. During the third and fourth quarters of 2002, Blockbuster implemented several promotions to increase demand for retail product. These initiatives were reduced in 2003 in order to focus on improving profitability. II 17 Rental Revenues For 2003, rental revenues increased 1.6% to $4.5 billion due primarily to increases in movie rental revenues, offset slightly by decreased game rental revenues. The following is a summary of rental revenues by product category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Movie rental: VHS $ 1,435.7 32 % $ 2,190.1 49 % $ 3,057.8 71 % DVD 2,599.7 57 1,741.0 39 799.1 18 Total movie rental 4,035.4 89 3,931.1 88 3,856.9 89 Game rental 498.1 11 529.3 12 457.8 11 Total rental revenues $ 4,533.5 100 % $ 4,460.4 100 % $ 4,314.7 100 % The increase in rental revenues was primarily due to a net increase of 198 company operated stores, favorable exchange rates and the fourth quarter of 2002 acquisition of the remaining interest in joint venture stores in Italy, partially offset by a 3.6% decrease in worldwide same store rental revenues, driven by decreases in both movies and games. The decrease in same store rental revenues was the result of a generally weaker rental market and increased competition from retail DVD sales as compared to prior year. Domestic operations represented 78.6% of rental revenues in 2003 as compared with 81.8% in 2002. Blockbusters rental revenues are generated from the rental of VHS tapes, DVDs, video games and from any eventual sale of previously rented VHS tapes, DVDs and video games. Revenues generated from rental transactions include revenues received in connection with the initial rental of product, as well as revenues related to any continuations of such rentals past the initial rental period, as contemplated by Blockbusters membership agreement. Blockbuster believes the decline in same store rental revenues was in line with the overall industry, reflecting a softening in the movie rental industry during the fourth quarter of 2003 and increased competition from retail DVD sales. Based upon Blockbusters belief that the size of the video rental market has contracted as a result of the competition from DVD sell through, simultaneous availability of rental and retail product and availability of other home video distribution channels, they expect the market to continue to decline slightly in the coming year. Retail Revenues For 2003, retail revenues increased 26% to $1.3 billion due to increases in both movie and game sales. The following is a summary of retail revenues by product category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Movie sales: VHS $ 65.2 5 % $ 128.8 13 % $ 167.9 23 % DVD 516.4 40 370.4 36 178.8 24 Total movie sales 581.6 45 499.2 49 346.7 47 Game sales 305.0 24 164.7 16 31.0 4 General retail 395.0 31 355.8 35 357.5 49 Total retail revenues $ 1,281.6 100 % $ 1,019.7 100 % $ 735.2 100 % Retail revenues continued to grow as a percentage of total revenues during 2003, representing 21.7% of total revenues in 2003, compared with 18.3% of total revenues in 2002. The increase in overall retail II 18 revenues was primarily the result of the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 of GameStation, Inc., favorable exchange rates and an increase in company operated stores. In addition, worldwide same store retail revenues increased 3.7% driven by increases across all categories. Overall, retail revenue growth reflected an increase in units sold, both for movies and games, as well as an increase in the average unit price for movies due to a higher DVD mix, partially offset by a lower average unit price for games. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Blockbuster recorded a non cash charge of approximately $1.3 billion resulting from the application of SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 to reduce the carrying value of its goodwill and other long lived assets which resulted in an operating loss of $847.8 million for full year 2003. The impact of the charge more than offset the increase in gross profit that was driven by the overall growth in revenues and gross margin to 59.6% in 2003 from 57.6% in 2002, with both rental and retail gross margins improving year over year. Blockbuster ended 2003 with 8,867 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 198 company operated stores and 124 franchise stores over December 31, 2002. Viacom currently owns approximately 81.5% of Blockbuster (NYSE: BBI). 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Video revenues increased 8% to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion principally driven by an increase of 5.1% in worldwide same store revenues and a net increase of 495 company operated stores from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. Domestic revenues increased 7% while international revenues increased 13%. International revenues represented approximately 21% of Video revenues, with approximately 55% from Europe and 23% from Canada. Worldwide same store revenues, which includes rental and retail product, increased 5.1% primarily resulting from 32.6% growth in same store retail revenues, and 0.9% growth in same store rental revenues over the prior year. Domestic and international same store revenues increased 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Blockbuster ended 2002 with 8,545 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 495 company operated stores and 69 franchise stores over December 31, 2001. For 2002, Video operating income increased to $355.8 million from a loss of $219.6 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The improvement in operating income was also due to the charge reflected in 2001 results as described below. Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for lease obligations related to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in January 2003. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these lease guarantees. The Company has accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations and the $18.7 million had no impact on the Companys operating results for 2002. During the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster began implementation of a strategic re merchandising plan to allow for an expansion of store space for DVD and other strategic product offerings, which it completed by December 31, 2001. In connection with its plan, Blockbuster disposed of approximately 30% of its rental VHS library in its stores, certain VHS merchandise inventory primarily located in its distribution center and certain games from its rental library in its stores. The net book value of the eliminated inventory, net of proceeds, resulted in a primarily non cash charge of approximately $195.9 million to operating expenses in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Blockbuster also recorded a charge of approximately $26.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to employee, labor and supply and disposal costs to execute the plan. Additionally, $2.6 million was charged to depreciation expense for the write off of fixed assets and $1.9 million was charged below operating income to equity in loss of affiliated companies for the adoption of a similar re merchandising plan at one of Blockbusters joint venture operations. The plan was completed by the end of 2001 through the destruction or sale of the identified items. II 19 Also, during the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster recorded approximately $27.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to two lawsuits. The amounts described above, including $141.7 million recorded as the change in accounting estimates for rental inventory, represented the 2001 pre tax charge of approximately $396.6 million. Financial Position Current assets increased 8% to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2003 from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily due to an increase of $615.3 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $219.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in other current assets of $133.4 million. The increase in accounts receivable was driven primarily by higher fourth quarter revenues from Entertainment as well as increased advertising and affiliate revenues at MTV Networks. Also contributing to this increase was the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central, as well as the timing of customer payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 6.4% at December 31, 2003 compared with 7.0% at December 31, 2002. This decrease reflected improved receivable aging at the end of 2003 and favorable customer settlements during the year. Net property and equipment decreased $120.7 million to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.1 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $896.8 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $534.4 million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $158.8 million and the addition of capital leases of $80.3 million. Goodwill of $57.1 billion decreased $59.5 million from December 31, 2002, reflecting the $1.3 billion non cash charge related to Blockbusters goodwill, partially offset by additional goodwill resulting from acquisitions, primarily the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central. Current liabilities increased $238.8 million to $7.6 billion primarily due to increases of $159.7 million in income taxes payable and $195.4 million in participants share, residuals and royalties payable, primarily for feature films. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $122.3 million, primarily relating to purchases made by Blockbuster at the end of 2002. Total debt, including current maturities, decreased $524.7 million to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2003 principally reflecting the use of cash from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Minority interest of $627.0 million at December 31, 2003 decreased $218.2 million from $845.2 million at December 31, 2002 reflecting the impact on minority owners of the write down of Blockbusters goodwill, as well as the purchases of Blockbuster Class A common stock in 2003 in order to maintain Viacoms consolidated tax position with Blockbuster. Cash Flows Operating Activities. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected net earnings of $1.4 billion adjusted for non cash charges of $1.3 billion and depreciation and amortization of $999.8 million. Additionally, operating cash flow reflected increases in participation liabilities and decreases in other assets offset by increases in receivables noted above and payments of accounts payable. The reduction in accounts payable was largely attributable to the purchases of merchandise inventory by Blockbuster at the end of 2002. Operating cash flow also benefited from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $77.1 million. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected net earnings of $725.7 million adjusted for non cash charges of $1.5 billion for the adoption of SFAS 142 and depreciation and amortization of $945.6 million. Additionally, operating cash flow benefited from the utilization of deferred tax assets of $655 million and from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $210.3 million. These increases were partially offset by an additional investment in Blockbusters merchandise and rental inventory and increased program rights for television series and sports. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected a net loss of $223.5 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of II 20 $3.1 billion, and for the 2001 Blockbuster, MTVN and UPN charges plus decreases in accounts receivable, partially offset by payments of accrued expenses and accounts payable. Cash paid for income taxes of $933.9 million for 2003 was higher than 2002 payments of $630.1 million principally due to higher operating income (excluding the non cash impairment charge) as well as the absence of 2002 non recurring items. The Company anticipates that higher operating income and the absence of non recurring tax attributes in 2004 will result in an increase in cash payments for taxes of approximately $500 million to $700 million over 2003 levels. While the Company does not have direct access to Blockbusters cash flow, should the Company complete the divestiture of Blockbuster in 2004, the Companys operating cash flow would decrease by the amount of their cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Blockbusters operating cash flow was approximately 17% of the Companys consolidated cash flow. Investing Activities. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected acquisitions of $1.3 billion, capital expenditures of $534.4 million principally for video stores, broadcasting equipment and outdoor advertising structures and additional investments of $40.0 million in affiliated companies. Acquisitions primarily consisted of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central, as well as Outdoors acquisition of a billboard operator in Puerto Rico and the purchase of $62.3 million of Blockbuster Class A stock by the Company in order to maintain its ownership interest of at least 80% for tax consolidation purposes. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets totaling $47.3 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected capital expenditures of $537.1 million, additional investments of $60.8 million in affiliated companies and acquisitions of $926.0 million primarily reflecting the acquisition of KCAL TV and the remaining interest in Noggin that the Company did not already own. Activity in 2002 also reflected Blockbusters acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in an Italy joint venture and the acquisition of a games retailer in the United Kingdom. During 2002, the Company acquired shares of Blockbusters Class A common stock for $11.2 million. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets totaling $72.2 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected the acquisitions of BET and outdoor businesses and capital expenditures of $515.4 million partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of radio stations and other assets. Capital expenditures for 2004 are anticipated to be approximately $700 million. The increase over 2003 levels is primarily to support Blockbusters various revenue and profitability growth initiatives, as well as systems and infrastructure improvements. The Company spent $534.4 million during 2003. Capital expenditures are funded with cash flows from operations. Financing Activities. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected the purchase of Company stock for $945.1 million, repayment of notes and debentures of $771.2 million and the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $472.1 million, including payments of financing costs. In addition, the Company paid $104.6 million in dividends to stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2003. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $736.5 million, net of financing costs, and from the exercise of employee stock options of $263.3 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.0 billion, the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $1.2 billion, and the purchase of Company stock for $1.1 billion. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.3 billion and from the exercise of employee stock options of $357.6 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflected the net repayment of debt for $1.6 billion and the purchase of Company stock for $1.1 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $184.6 million. II 21 In 2004, the declarations of a $.06 per share quarterly dividend would result in an annual payment to Viacoms stockholders of approximately $420 million. On January 28, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $.06 per share quarterly dividend payable April 1, 2004 to Viacoms stockholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2004. Stock Purchase Program During 2003, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 23.6 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $981.4 million under its stock purchase programs, of which $545.3 million was spent in the fourth quarter for 13.3 million shares. As of December 31, 2003 there was approximately $1.9 billion remaining under the current $3.0 billion purchase program. From January 1 through March 10, 2004, the Company purchased an additional 8.2 million shares for approximately $336.6 million. During 2002, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 27.8 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.2 billion under its stock purchase programs, of which $350.7 million was spent in the fourth quarter of 2002 for 8.1 million shares. Acquisitions On May 22, 2003, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central that it did not own for $1.2 billion in cash. Comedy Centrals results have been consolidated as part of Cable Networks, effective from the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of approximately $1.1 billion was allocated to goodwill. The final allocation of the purchase price will be based on comprehensive final evaluations of the fair value of Comedy Centrals assets acquired and liabilities assumed. On May 15, 2002, the Company acquired the assets of KCAL TV Los Angeles for approximately $650 million. During 2002, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% interest in Noggin, the 24 hour digital network for kids that it did not already own for approximately $100 million. Blockbuster acquired the 51% interest that it did not already own in a joint venture in Italy and also acquired a games retailer in the United Kingdom for approximately $82.4 million in the aggregate in 2002. Capital Structure At December 31, 2003 2002 Notes payable to banks $ 107.2 $ 423.7 Commercial paper 20.0 174.6 Senior debt 9,474.7 9,530.7 Senior subordinated debt 66.3 56.1 Other notes 26.0 28.6 Obligations under capital leases 387.0 392.2 Total Debt 10,081.2 10,605.9 Less current portion 196.3 199.0 Less discontinued operations debt (a) 201.7 201.7 Total Long Term Debt $ 9,683.2 $ 10,205.2 (a)Included in "Other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. Total debt of $10.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 was 13.8% and 14.5%, respectively, as a percentage of total capitalization of the Company. The senior debt of Viacom Inc. is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary Viacom International Inc. The senior debt and senior subordinated debt of the Companys wholly owned II 22 subsidiaries, CBS Broadcasting Inc. and Go Outdoor Systems Holdings S.A., respectively, are not guaranteed; the aggregate outstanding amount of such debt at December 31, 2003 was $118.5 million. The Companys total debt presented above includes, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, (i) an aggregate unamortized premium of $41.4 million and $49.5 million and (ii) the net change in the carrying value of the debt relating to fair value swaps of $48.2 million and $86.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the following debt issuances, maturities and redemptions occurred: Debt Issuances May 14, 2003, $300.0 million 4.625% senior notes due 2018 May 14, 2003, $450.0 million 5.50% senior debentures due 2033 August 28, 2002, $600.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2012 April 25, 2002, $700.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2007 Interest on all of the above debt instruments is paid semi annually. Debt Maturities September 1, 2003, 6.875% notes, $275.0 million January 15, 2003, 6.75% senior notes, $333.8 million June 15, 2002, 8.375% notes, $321.8 million January 15, 2002, 7.50% senior notes, $250.0 million January 1, 2002, 7.625% senior notes, $143.0 million Debt Redemptions July 15, 2003, $150.0 million 7.50% senior debentures due 2023 at 103.6% of principal August 1, 2002, $239.5 million 8.25% senior debentures due 2022 at 103.5% of principal June 15, 2002, $2.6 million 8.875% senior subordinated notes due 2007 at 104.4% of principal June 1, 2002, $31.1 million 8.875% senior debentures due 2022 at 104.1% of principal January 15, 2002, $18.7 million 11.375% subordinated exchange debentures due 2009 at 105.7% of principal For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company repurchased approximately $1.0 million and $55.0 million of its debt, respectively. The Companys scheduled maturities of long term debt at face value, excluding commercial paper and capital leases, outstanding at December 31, 2003 were as follows: Year of Maturity 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and thereafter Long term debt $ 126.1 $ 1,472.8 $ 801.7 $ 700.2 $ .2 $ 6,483.6 II 23  Viacom Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2003, the Companys credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, totaled $4.65 billion comprised of a $1.7 billion 364 day revolving facility due February 2004, a $1.45 billion revolving facility due May 2005 and a $1.5 billion revolving facility due March 2006 (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). In February 2004, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion 5 year credit facility which replaced the $1.7 billion and $1.45 billion facilities. The terms and conditions of the $3.0 billion facility are substantially similar to the $1.5 billion facility. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the $3.0 billion and $1.5 billion facilities. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined at the Companys option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Companys senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.41 billion in the aggregate. The facilities contain covenants, which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities. The primary purpose of the credit facilities is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2003, the Company had commercial paper borrowings of $20.0 million under its $4.65 billion commercial paper program. The Companys credit facilities supporting the commercial paper borrowings totaled $4.5 billion in February 2004. Borrowings under the program have maturities of less than a year. At December 31, 2003, the Company had classified approximately $21.6 million of commercial paper and other debt scheduled to mature within the next twelve months as long term debt, reflecting its intent and ability, through the existence of unused revolving credit facilities, to refinance this debt on a long term basis. Blockbuster Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2003, Blockbusters credit agreement (the "Blockbuster Credit Agreement") was comprised of a $600.0 million long term revolver due July 1, 2004 and a $100.0 million term loan due in quarterly installments ending July 1, 2004. Blockbuster had $600.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the long term revolver at December 31, 2003. Interest rates under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement are based on the prime rate in the United States or LIBOR (plus a margin, or "LIBOR spread," based on leverage ratios, which is currently 1.25%) at Blockbusters option at the time of borrowing. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2003 for borrowings under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement was 2.4%. A variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver (0.25% at December 31, 2003). The Blockbuster Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment of dividends, purchase of Blockbusters common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, Blockbuster was in compliance with all covenants under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement. Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company had an aggregate of $1.0 billion and $981.9 million, respectively, outstanding under revolving receivable securitization programs. The programs result in the sale of receivables on a non recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable and debt on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these arrangements because they provide an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from the programs were used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The terms of the revolving securitization II 24 arrangements require that the receivable pools subject to the programs meet certain performance ratios. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization programs. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes that its operating cash flow ($3.5 billion in 2003), cash and cash equivalents ($850.7 million at December 31, 2003), borrowing capacity under committed bank facilities (which consisted of unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.41 billion in the aggregate at December 31, 2003), and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, including commitments and contingencies, capital and investing commitments and its financing requirements for the foreseeable future. The funding for commitments to purchase sports programming rights, television and film operations, and talent contracts will come primarily from cash flow from operations. The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include capital expenditures, share purchases, acquisitions, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activity available to meet these needs. Any net cash funding requirements are financed with short term borrowings (primarily commercial paper) and long term debt. Commercial paper borrowings, which also accommodate day to day changes in funding requirements, are backed by committed bank facilities that may be utilized in the event that commercial paper borrowings are not available. The Companys strong credit position, which is reflected by an A /A3 rating, affords access to the capital markets. The Company anticipates that scheduled debt maturities in 2004 will be funded with cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operating activities. There are no provisions in any of the Companys material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in the Companys debt ratings. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock and warrants of Viacom that may be issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 billion. The registration statement was first declared effective on January 8, 2001. The net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by Viacom for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital and capital expenditures, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. To date, the Company has issued $2.385 billion of securities under the shelf registration statement. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company had a total of $759.8 million of long term debt maturities, redemptions and repurchases and issued $750 million of long term debt. The long term debt issuances maintained the Companys unused borrowing capacity and its financial flexibility. II 25 As of December 31, 2003, the Companys significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and thereafter Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 13,199.2 $ 3,555.8 $ 3,972.2 $ 2,152.2 $ 3,519.0 Operating leases (2) 5,436.8 972.0 1,546.1 1,016.9 1,901.8 Guaranteed minimum franchise payments (3) 1,453.5 424.5 620.3 204.7 204.0 Purchase obligations (4) 1,155.9 758.9 238.2 79.7 79.1 Capital lease obligations (including interest) (5) 508.6 102.2 161.7 116.6 128.1 Long term debt obligations (6) 9,584.6 126.1 2,274.5 700.4 6,483.6 Other long term liabilities (7) 1,763.5 1,458.0 192.1 113.4 (1)Programming and talent commitments of the Company include $8.2 billion for the acquisition of sports programming rights, $3.2 billion relating to television, radio and feature film production and acquisitions and $1.1 billion for talent contracts. (2)Includes long term noncancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3)Viacoms outdoor advertising business has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks and stadium signage. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchiser is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. (4)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (5)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders and buildings. (6)Long term debt obligations are presented at face value. (7)Long term contractual obligations, including program liabilities and participations due to producers and residuals. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements primarily consist of the guarantees described below. Guarantees The Company owns a 50% equity interest in United Cinemas International ("UCI"), which operates movie theaters in Europe, Latin America and Asia. As of December 31, 2003, the Company guaranteed approximately $291.9 million of UCIs debt obligations under a revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2004, and $175.6 million of UCIs theater leases. The Company also owns a 50% interest in WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. and Graumans Theatres LLC and guarantees certain theater leases for approximately $13.2 million. The debt and lease guarantees would only be triggered upon non payment by the respective primary obligors. These guarantees are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. Additionally, the Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $348.0 million at December 31, 2003 and are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. The Company is also subject to certain off balance sheet lease guarantees related to the divestitures of certain businesses. In October 1998, Blockbuster Music stores were sold to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. ("Wherehouse"). Some of the leases transferred in connection with this sale had previously been guaranteed either by the Company or its affiliates. The remaining initial terms of these leases expire on various dates through 2007. However, certain leases contain renewal options that can II 26 extend the primary lease term and remain subject to the guarantee. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to any amount paid under these guarantees. On January 21, 2003, Wherehouse filed a petition for protection under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law. Based on information regarding lease and guaranty expirations originally available to Blockbuster in connection with the Wherehouse bankruptcy, Blockbusters estimated a contingent liability of approximately $36.0 million. Of this amount Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 which represented its estimate of the lease guarantee obligation at that time. During 2003, Blockbuster paid approximately $8.2 million associated with the lease guarantee obligation. As of December 31, 2003, Blockbuster estimated its contingent liability for Wherehouse leases to be approximately $12.6 million. Of this amount Blockbuster determined its reserve to be $7.9 million and as a result Blockbuster reduced its original reserve by $2.6 million. The Company had previously accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations. Legal Matters Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had pending approximately 112,280 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 103,800 as of December 31, 2002 and approximately 106,000 as of December 31, 2001. The 2002 and 2001 numbers of claims included approximately 1,100 claims and 7,100 claims, respectively, on inactive dockets in various states which would not be counted as pending under the Companys current methodology. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2003, approximately 82,340 were pending in state courts, 27,400 in federal court and approximately 2,540 were third party claims. During 2003, the Company received approximately 36,990 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 28,500 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs (recovery) in 2003 and 2002 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $(8.7) million and $28 million, respectively. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. If proceeds received in 2003 from commuted insurance policies were excluded from the Companys total costs in 2003, the Companys total costs after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits would have been $56.6 million. Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos, lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure, other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease. Claims identified as cancer remain a small percentage of asbestos claims II 27 pending at December 31, 2003. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities and that these asbestos liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. Antitrust. In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the Company, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries with respect to a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint included federal antitrust and California state law claims. In August 2003, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal court judgment. The Supreme Court of the United States refused plaintiffs petition for writ of certiorari in March 2004. In February 2003, a similar complaint that had been filed in a Los Angeles County Superior Court was also dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the California state court dismissal, as well as a prior denial of class certification. The Company believes that the plaintiffs positions in these litigations are without merit and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in the litigations. Blockbuster Securities Actions. During February and March 2003, putative class action complaints were filed against Blockbuster in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. A director and certain officers of Blockbuster were also named as defendants. The remaining putative class actions have been consolidated into one action styled In re Blockbuster Inc. Securities Litigation, which is pending in the same court. The consolidated amended complaint, filed July 2003, claims violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the time period approximately between February and December 2002. It also generally alleges that the defendants made untrue statements of material fact and or omitted to disclose material facts about Blockbusters business and operations, that the value of Blockbusters common stock was therefore artificially inflated and that certain of the individual defendants sold shares of Blockbusters common stock at inflated prices. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. In addition, three shareholder derivative actions were filed in February, March and April 2003, of which one is pending in federal court in Texas and two have been consolidated into one action in Texas state court, each arising from substantially similar operative facts. These shareholder derivative actions include claims for breach of fiduciary duties for various time periods beginning in February 2002 and name certain Blockbuster officers and directors, some of whom are directors and or executive officers of the Company, as individual defendants, and Blockbuster as a nominal defendant. The Company and Blockbuster believe the plaintiffs positions in all of these actions are without merit and Blockbuster intends to vigorously defend these matters. Other. In December 2002, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Blockbuster had breached the revenue sharing agreement between the two parties. Buena Vista claims damages in excess of $120 million. Blockbuster has answered and asserted counterclaims for reformation and breach of contract. On July 22, 2003, the California federal court granted Buena Vistas motion for partial summary judgment, stating in its ruling that a liquidated damages provision in the contract is enforceable. The court reaffirmed its ruling when it denied Blockbusters motion for reconsideration in February 2004. Blockbuster has several remaining defenses to the claims asserted by Buena Vista. Blockbuster and the Company believe the plaintiffs position is without merit, and intend to vigorously defend this matter. II 28 Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that all of the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business with companies in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the non designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of "Other items, net". The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2003, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $296.9 million, of which $12.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $284.9 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. At December 31, 2002, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $266.0 million, of which $49.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $217.0 million represented hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is exposed to movements in short term rates. Swap agreements are used to modify this exposure. This includes both fixed to variable rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, and variable to fixed rate swaps, which are designed as cash flow hedges. Based on the amount of variable rate debt and receivable securitization programs outstanding at December 31, 2003, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause a $23.8 million change to pre tax earnings. As of December 31, 2003 if all parties were to agree, the swaps could have been terminated by a net payment from the counterparties of approximately $47.6 million. The Company has entered into cash flow swap agreements which effectively converted variable rate interest payments on commercial paper to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount outstanding relating to these agreements was approximately $19.4 million and the swap agreements mature in September 2004. Interest is received based upon three month LIBOR and is paid at approximately 5.07%. The amount of the ineffectiveness of these cash flow hedges that was reflected in earnings was immaterial. The effective portion of the change in value of cash flow hedges is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During the next twelve months, approximately $.5 million will be amortized into earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedges included in earnings was not material. The change in value of the fair value hedges and the hedged instruments is reported in earnings for the periods presented. II 29 On May 14, 2003, the Company entered into additional $300 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2018 and the Company receives interest at approximately 4.55% and pays three month LIBOR. On April 25, 2002, the Company entered into additional $700 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2007 and the Company receives interest at approximately 5.11% on $400 million and 5.35% on $300 million, and pays three month LIBOR. During December 2001, the Company entered into $750 million notional amount of swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. Of the $750 million notional amount, $225 million received interest at approximately 3.2% and was to mature on January 15, 2003 and $275 million received interest at approximately 3.8% and was to mature on September 1, 2003. These swaps were terminated in November 2002 resulting in the Company receiving $8.7 million in cash which was amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the respective debt. These fair value hedges were fully effective. The remaining $250 million in notional amount matures on June 1, 2005 and receives interest at approximately 4.5%. These fair value hedges are fully effective. All the swaps paid or pay interest based on three month LIBOR. Credit Risk The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. The Companys receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2003 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Companys products and services are sold. Related Parties National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") is a closely held corporation that beneficially owns the Companys Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 71% of the voting power of all classes of the Companys Common Stock, and approximately 11% of the Companys Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis at December 31, 2003. Owners of the Companys Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. The Companys Class B Common Stock does not have voting rights. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios including Paramount Pictures, a division of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, NAI made payments to Paramount Pictures in the aggregate amounts of approximately $9.6 million, $12.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. NAI and Mr. Redstone owned in the aggregate approximately 30% of the common stock of Midway Games Inc. ("Midway") as of December 31, 2003. Midway sells home video games to Blockbuster and also places advertisements on various of the Companys cable networks from time to time. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, transactions with Midway totaled approximately $9.9 million, $12.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively. The Company owns a minority equity interest in Westwood One, Inc. ("Westwood One"). Most of Infinitys radio stations are affiliated with Westwood One, and Westwood One distributes nationally certain of the Companys radio programming. In connection with these arrangements, the Company receives affiliation fees as well as programming cost reimbursements and in certain instances, shares in revenue II 30 from the sale by Westwood One of Infinitys programming. In addition, certain employees of Infinity serve as officers of Westwood One for which the Company receives a management fee. CBS Television and Cable Networks also enter into programming agreements with Westwood One. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $85.5 million, $127.7 million and $104.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Recent Pronouncements In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The adoption of SFAS 150 as of July 1, 2003 did not have any effect on the Companys financial position. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51" which was replaced in December 2003 by the issuance of FIN 46R ("FIN 46R"). FIN 46R explains how to identify variable interest entities ("VIEs") and how a company should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46R requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. The provisions of FIN 46R are effective for special purpose entities (SPEs) as of December 31, 2003. The Company has completed its review of its special purpose entities under FIN 46R and has determined that the application of FIN 46R did not impact the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows. The provisions of FIN 46R must be applied to VIEs as of March 31, 2004. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of the remaining provisions of FIN 46R will have on the Company. Critical Accounting Policies Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates. Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with SOP 00 2, which requires managements judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments. The cost of Blockbusters rental library, which includes videocassettes, DVDs and games, is amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 12 months to an estimated residual value of $2 to $5 per II 31 unit, according to the product category. The estimates for useful lives and residual values of the rental library are continually evaluated based on changes in consumer demand. Changes in demand or buying patterns may impact the carrying value of the rental library and rental margins. During 2001, Blockbuster changed the estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for videocassettes and game products, which resulted in inventory write downs and increased amortization expense. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142 and a non cash charge would be required. Balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to taxes, legal issues, restructuring charges and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments and estimates by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued businesses, including environmental and asbestos are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled. The Company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. For 2003, the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension plans decreased as a result of plan assets producing a return higher than the expected return due to the market conditions in 2003 partially offset by lowering the discount rate for the Companys major plans from 6.5% in 2002 to 6.0% in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the total accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of the corresponding plan assets and therefore, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability of $773.8 million. As of December 31, 2002, such pension liability was $865.0 million. Risk Factors The risk factors listed below, in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report, could affect the business and future results of the Company. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its over the air networks, basic cable networks, television stations, radio stations and outdoor businesses. The sale of advertising is affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising. Adverse changes to any of these factors, including as a result of acts of terrorism or war, could have a negative effect on revenues. II 32 The Companys basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent upon affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home satellite services ("DTH") distributors on acceptable terms. The loss of carriage on such distributors, or continued carriage on less favorable terms, could adversely affect, with respect to basic cable networks, revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising and, with respect to premium subscription television networks, subscriber fee revenues. In addition, continued consolidation among cable and or DTH distributors and vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business, could have an adverse effect on subscriber fees and advertising revenues, as the Companys ability to launch new networks or maintain or obtain additional distribution for existing networks is impacted by these factors. Operating results derived from the Companys motion picture and television production businesses fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public, which are difficult to predict. Motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent, reduced availability of co financing opportunities, and other factors have resulted in higher production costs. In addition, the commercial success of the Companys motion picture and television productions depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions, and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142 and a non cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a significant effect on the Companys reported net earnings. The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized pursuing the divestiture of Viacoms approximately 81.5% interest in Blockbuster, and the Company, while continuing to consider other alternatives, anticipates that the divestiture would be achieved through a tax free split off. The Company may determine, for market or other reasons, not to effectuate the divestiture of Blockbuster, or a split off of Blockbuster, if it does occur, may be taxable. In addition, should the Company complete a divestiture of Blockbuster, if the fair value of Blockbuster at the date of divestiture were below book value, a loss would be recognized. Such a loss could have a significant effect on the Companys reported net earnings. While the Company seeks to ensure compliance with FCC indecency laws and regulations, the definition of "indecency" is subject to interpretation and there can be no assurance that employees of the Company will not make decisions resulting in the broadcast of programming that does not meet such standards. Such programming could subject the Company to regulatory review or investigation, fines, adverse publicity or other sanctions including the loss of station licenses. Technology developments, including digital copying and file compression, and the growing penetration of high bandwidth Internet connections, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. The Company takes actions to vigorously enforce its rights and protect its copyrighted materials and products, however there can be no assurance that it will be successful in preventing the distribution of pirated content. Increased piracy of the Companys copyrighted materials could negatively affect its operations and financial results. Advances in technologies such as personal video recorders and video on demand and changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these or other technologies could have an adverse effect on the Companys businesses, particularly its television and video businesses. II 33 The Company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued businesses, including environmental liabilities, liabilities related to illnesses of former employees and other pending and threatened litigation. While the pending or threatened litigations and environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance in this regard. The Companys home video retail business currently enjoys a competitive advantage over most other movie distribution channels, except theatrical releases, due to the early timing of the video retailer "distribution window." The video business could be negatively affected if the video retail distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release; the length of the video retail distribution window were shortened; or the video retail distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now. The Company believes that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable video retail industry; however, the order, length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie and the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of any future decisions by the studios. Increased studio licensing of product to video on demand and similar services might impact their decisions with respect to the timing and exclusivity of the video retailer distribution window with possible adverse effect on the Video business. The Company cannot control or predict with certainty studio pricing policies for DVD and VHS product. Current studio policies reducing the pricing of movies released to DVDs and an increasing percentage of VHS titles allow for an affordable sales price by the retailer to the consumer from the beginning of the home video distribution window. This lower "sell through" pricing has led to increased competition from other retailers, including mass merchants and online retailers who are able to purchase DVDs for sale to consumers at the same time as traditional video retailers purchase both DVDs and videocassettes for rental. If sell through pricing, increased competition and consumer interest in building personal DVD libraries cause consumers to increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies, the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to increase rental market share, to replace profits from rentals with profits from sales of sell through product, or to otherwise positively affect gross profits. In addition, if studios make future changes in their pricing policies, which could include pricing rental windows for DVDs or expanded exploitation by studios of any international copyright laws that allow studios to charge retailers more for DVD and VHS rental product than for sell through product, the profitability of the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to enter into arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations. The Companys operating results fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases, as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition. NAI, through its ownership of the Companys Class A common stock, has voting control of the Company. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require shareholder approval, including the election of directors, issuance of securities and transactions involving a change of control. During 2003, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with each of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer which addresses the specific responsibilities of each position. There can be no assurance that either of these executives will remain with the Company for the full term of his employment agreement. A departure of either of these executives, or of other key executives of the Company, could have an adverse effect on the Company. In the operation of its businesses, the Company engages the services of writers, directors, actors and others, which are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages and or higher costs in connection with these agreements could adversely impact the Companys operations. II 34 Changes in laws and regulations, including in particular FCC ownership and indecency rules, could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the operations and ownership of the Companys properties. Some of the Companys businesses are seasonal. The home video rental and retail business and the consumer publishing business are subject to increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays, while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is generated from May through September. In addition, the home video and theme parks businesses revenues are influenced by weather. The Companys radio and outdoor advertising businesses experience fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers. These risk factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the Company. Other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors also could have material adverse effects on the Companys future results.

Cable Networks contributed 21% to consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. TELEVISION: The Television segment consists of the CBS and UPN television networks, the Companys 39 owned broadcast television stations, and its television production and syndication business, including KING WORLD PRODUCTIONS and PARAMOUNT TELEVISION.

RADIO: The Radio segment owns and operates 185 radio stations in 41 U.S. markets through INFINITY RADIO. Radio revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales.

VIDEO: The Video segment consists of an approximately 81.5% equity interest in Blockbuster Inc., which operates and franchises 8,867 BLOCKBUSTER video stores worldwide.

Video contributed 22%, 23% and 22%, respectively, to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. II 3 On February 10, 2004, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the Company to pursue the divestiture of Viacoms approximately 81.5% interest in Blockbuster, based on the conclusion that Blockbuster would be better positioned as a company completely independent of Viacom. The Company anticipates that the divestiture would be achieved through a tax free split off, but will also continue to consider other alternatives. The transaction is subject to further approval of the Viacom Board and an assessment of market conditions. The split off, which would result in a reduction of Viacoms outstanding shares, is expected to be completed by mid 2004. Consolidated Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 and 2002 vs. 2001 Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2003, revenues of $26.6 billion increased 8% from $24.6 billion in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, revenues of $24.6 billion increased 6% from $23.2 billion in 2001. Revenue growth for each year primarily reflected increases in advertising sales, rental/retail sales and affiliate fees, along with continuing contributions from feature film exploitation. The table below presents the Companys consolidated revenues by type and the percentage and amount of contribution of each type of revenue to consolidated revenues, net of intercompany eliminations, for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues by Type Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Advertising sales $ 12,071.9 45 % $ 11,225.1 46 % $ 10,722.8 46 % Rental/retail sales 5,815.1 22 5,480.1 22 5,049.9 22 Affiliate fees 2,407.7 9 2,199.0 9 2,030.9 9 Feature film exploitation 2,212.4 8 1,860.0 7 1,853.6 8 TV license fees 1,514.5 6 1,472.2 6 1,359.2 6 Other 2,563.7 10 2,369.3 10 2,206.4 9 Total Revenues $ 26,585.3 100 % $ 24,605.7 100 % $ 23,222.8 100 % Advertising sales, which represented 45% of the Companys consolidated revenues for 2003, increased 8% in 2003 to $12.1 billion reflecting growth in all of the Companys segments which generate advertising revenues: Cable Networks, Television, Radio and Outdoor. The increase in advertising revenues was due to increased units sold and higher rates at the cable and broadcast networks and 7% higher U.S. billboard and 17% higher European outdoor revenues primarily driven by favorable exchange rates. For 2002, advertising sales increased 5% to $11.2 billion led by increases in Cable Networks, Television and Radio. The 2002 increase in advertising revenues was driven primarily by increased units sold at cable networks, as well as increases in average unit rates and units sold at the broadcast network operations. Rental/retail sales for 2003 were up 6% to $5.8 billion reflecting a 26% increase in retail sales and a 2% increase in rental sales. Both rental and retail growth were driven by an increase of 198 worldwide company operated stores since December 31, 2002, the acquisition of GameStation, Inc., a leading games retailer in the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of 2002 and favorable foreign exchange rates. Worldwide same store revenues declined 2.2% reflecting a 3.6% decline in same store rental revenues as a result of a weaker rental market worldwide partially offset by an increase in same store retail revenues of 3.7% reflecting growth in both movie and games sales. Rental/retail sales for 2002 were up 9% to $5.5 billion with rental sales growth of 3% and retail sales growth of 39% driven by an increase of 495 worldwide company operated stores since December 31, 2001 and increased DVD and game product sales. Affiliate fees for 2003 increased 9% to $2.4 billion primarily driven by rate increases and growth in subscriber volume at MTVN as well as the acquisition of Comedy Central in May 2003. Affiliate fees for II 4 2002 increased 8% to $2.2 billion reflecting rate increases at each of the Cable Networks as well as an increase in subscriber volume at MTV Networks digital channels. Feature film revenues increased 19% to $2.2 billion in 2003 primarily reflecting 62% higher worldwide home entertainment revenues from DVD sales and contributions from increased syndication, theatrical and pay television revenues partially offset by lower network revenues. Feature film revenues remained relatively flat in 2002 versus 2001 at $1.9 billion reflecting growth in DVD sales primarily offset by lower theatrical revenues. Television license fees increased 3% to $1.5 billion in 2003 principally reflecting increased syndication revenues due to a full year of results for THE DR. PHIL SHOW versus four months in 2002. Television license fee revenues increased 8% in 2002 to $1.5 billion primarily from increased syndication revenues from cable sales and revenues from THE DR. PHIL SHOW, launched in 2002. Other revenues, which include revenues from publishing, theme park operations, movie theaters and consumer products, increased 8% to $2.6 billion in 2003 primarily reflecting higher Nickelodeon consumer products revenues as well as higher theaters revenues from favorable foreign currency translation, higher admission prices and increased per capita spending. For 2002, other revenues increased 7% to $2.4 billion primarily due to higher publishing, theaters and Nickelodeon consumer products revenues. The Companys 2004 revenues are expected to benefit from the continued strengthening of the advertising market and from the Super Bowl telecast on CBS in February, as well as the full year impact of the Comedy Central acquisition. Assuming the divestiture of Blockbuster occurs, the Companys advertising supported businesses as a percentage of consolidated revenues would significantly increase. International Revenues The Company generated approximately 18% of its total revenues from international regions in 2003 and 16% in 2002 and 2001, principally from Europe and Canada. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Europe $ 2,839.8 58 % $ 2,263.4 56 % $ 2,030.6 54 % Canada 1,087.1 22 927.2 23 881.7 23 All other 960.1 20 838.6 21 844.0 23 Total International Revenues $ 4,887.0 100 % $ 4,029.2 100 % $ 3,756.3 100 % Operating Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2003, operating expenses of $16.3 billion increased 9% over 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, operating expenses of $14.9 billion increased 3% over 2001. The major components and changes in operating expenses were as follows: Production and program rights amortization expenses represented approximately 47% of total operating expenses in 2003 and reflect the costs and amortization of television and theatrical inventory, including direct production costs, residuals and participation expenses, production overhead and acquisition costs as well as costs attributable to television and radio programming expenses including on air talent and other production costs, and costs and amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast networks, cable networks and broadcast stations. For 2003, production and program rights amortization increased 11% over 2002 primarily due to 22% higher costs at Cable Networks, principally for new and existing programming at MTVN. Also contributing to the increases were higher costs for contractual series at the broadcast networks and more original summer programming, higher sports rights amortization at CBS Network and Radio II 5 and higher feature film amortization. Production and program rights amortization expenses for 2002 increased 4% over 2001 driven by contractual increases in costs associated with series at the broadcast networks and increases at the Company owned television stations due to new entertainment and sports programming investments. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses represented approximately 27% of total operating expenses in 2003 and include amortization of the costs of videocassette, DVD and game inventory, revenue sharing expenses on rental inventory, store employee compensation expense and occupancy expenses. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2003 increased 6% over 2002 reflecting an increase in rental/retail sales of 6%, an increase of 198 worldwide company operated stores partially offset by improved product buying and inventory management. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2002 increased 1% over 2001 reflecting a shift in product mix and the net increase of 495 worldwide company operated stores, partially offset by the 2001 charge associated with Blockbusters re merchandising and store reconfiguration plans. Distribution expenses, which represented approximately 9% of total operating expenses in 2003, reflect advertising and other distribution costs incurred primarily with respect to theatrical and television product. Distribution expenses for 2003 increased 11% over 2002 reflecting higher print and advertising costs for feature films in theatrical release. Distribution expenses for 2002 increased 8% over 2001 reflecting higher costs associated with prints and advertising due to the higher number of feature films released partially offset by a decrease in other distribution costs. Other operating expenses for 2003, included an increase in Outdoor expenses of 7%, reflecting higher rotation and embellishment expenses for billboards. Outdoor expenses for 2002 increased 10% over 2001 reflecting higher guarantee payments for transit contracts. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, which include expenses incurred to provide back office support, occupancy, selling and marketing costs, increased 4% to $4.4 billion in 2003 reflecting increased costs from Comedy Central, acquired in May 2003, increased employee related expenses and higher directors and officers insurance premiums and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a pre tax gain of $40 million received in 2003 from the settlement of a 2001 physical damage and business interruption claim. For 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $4.2 billion. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 16% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 17% for 2002 and 18% for 2001. Advertising expenses remained relatively flat at $1.4 billion for 2003 and 2002 reflecting higher advertising costs for feature films in theatrical release offset by decreases at Blockbuster. Advertising expenses decreased 5% in 2002 versus 2001 reflecting lower advertising spending at the broadcast and cable networks and Company owned television stations partially offset by increases at Blockbuster for marketing efforts associated with key rental and retail promotions. Included within selling, general and administrative expenses are residual costs, which primarily include pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. Residual costs for 2003 increased to $146.5 million from $67.8 million principally due to actuarial losses from a lower discount rate and a decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets in 2003. Residual costs decreased to $67.8 million in 2002 from $87.2 million in 2001 due primarily to the recognition of actuarial gains for benefit plans of certain divested businesses. II 6 Impairment and Restructuring Charges During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non cash impairment charge related to Blockbuster of approximately $1.3 billion in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. In completing its analysis of the fair value of the video business during the fourth quarter of 2003, several events led Blockbuster to conclude that the business had incremental risks that were required to be included in its evaluation of goodwill. These events included Blockbusters lower than anticipated same store revenues during the December 2003 selling season caused by increased competition from retail DVD and other home video distribution channels. Blockbuster also identified risks associated with certain international operations, such as increased competition, two tiered pricing and piracy. Additionally, Blockbusters review of long lived assets in conjunction with SFAS 144 resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $18.5 million to reduce the carrying value of certain fixed assets in four international markets. These charges were included in "Impairment and restructuring charges" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, restructuring charges of $26.4 million were recorded at Cable Networks. These charges principally reflected $17.7 million of severance liabilities resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Comedy Central that the Company did not own and organizational changes at Showtime Networks Inc. Also included in this total was $8.4 million for additional lease termination costs for MTVN due to a change in the initial estimate for its 2001 charge. In 2001, the Company recorded a Cable Networks restructuring charge of $66.6 million for MTVN and a UPN restructuring charge of $52.8 million. These charges were principally associated with reducing headcount and closing certain MTVN domestic and foreign offices and integrating UPN into CBS Network operations. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and amortization increased 6% to $999.8 million principally driven by an increase of 198 company operated video stores and the addition of broadcasting equipment and outdoor advertising properties. For the year ended December 31, 2002, depreciation and amortization decreased to $945.6 million as compared with $3.1 billion for 2001. This decrease was due to the Companys initial adoption of SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002, and as a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense decreased 9% to $776.0 million from $848.3 million primarily due to a reduction in debt including lower average commercial paper borrowings. The Company had approximately $10.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at weighted average interest rates of 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense decreased 12% to $848.3 million from $969.2 million due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates. The Company had approximately $11.5 billion at December 31, 2001 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at a weighted average interest rate of 6.8%. Interest Income For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest income decreased to $14.8 million from $15.8 million in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest income decreased to $15.8 million from $30.6 million in 2001 due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in 2002 versus 2001. II 7 Other Items, Net For the year ended December 31, 2003, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $3.4 million principally consisting of foreign exchange losses of $2.3 million, losses associated with securitizing trade receivables of $14.8 million and an aggregate loss of $7.0 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value, partially offset by a net gain on the disposition of investments of $14.8 million and an insurance recoupment of $5.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $30.0 million which principally consisted of foreign exchange losses of $51.9 million, losses of $19.7 million associated with securitizing trade receivables and an aggregate loss of approximately $13.8 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value. These losses were partially offset by the recovery of advertising commitments of $29.8 million, a gain of $18.8 million on the sale of a telephone kiosk advertising business and a net gain of $5.5 million from the sale of investments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, "Other items, net" of $254.7 million principally reflected a gain from television station swaps of $210.1 million and the recovery of certain advertising commitments of $250.0 million offset by impairment losses of approximately $125.0 million related to the Companys investments. The one time pre tax gains were also partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $8.2 million and losses of $22.8 million associated with securitizing trade receivables. Additionally, 2001 reflects an impairment loss of $46.6 million related to the purchase of two television stations. The recovery of advertising commitments in 2002 and 2001 reflected the restructuring of agreements with several Internet companies. As a result, the Company was released from related advertising commitments and reversed related deferred revenues. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. For 2003, the annual effective tax rate, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting was 55.9% in 2003, 38.8% in 2002 and 118.5% in 2001. The annual 2003 rate was adversely affected by the non cash charge recorded to reduce the carrying value of Blockbuster goodwill. Excluding the non cash charge, the annual effective tax rate was 39.8% in 2003. The annual 2001 rate was adversely affected by non deductible goodwill amortization. Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $.6 million for 2003, $39.5 million for 2002 and $127.0 million for 2001. The amounts principally reflected operating losses from Internet investments and international ventures partially offset by positive results of Westwood One and Comedy Central prior to its acquisition in May 2003. Additionally, 2001 reflected operating losses from Internet equity investments that were no longer operating in 2002. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest for 2003 and 2002 primarily represented the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Minority interest increased in 2003 principally due to recording the minority interest portion of the 2003 Blockbuster non cash charge. Minority interest for 2001 primarily represented the minority ownership of Infinity prior to its merger with the Company on February 21, 2001, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest and Tax Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which requires the capitalization of asset retirement costs as part of the total cost of the II 8 related long lived asset and the depreciation of this cost over the corresponding assets useful life. As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded a charge of $18.5 million, or $.01 per share, reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142 and recorded an after tax non cash charge of $1.5 billion (net of minority interest of $336.1 million), or $.84 per basic and $.83 per diluted share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net Earnings (Loss) The Company reported net earnings of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 versus net earnings of $725.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a net loss of $223.5 million for 2001. The improvement in net earnings in 2003 was primarily due to revenue growth from increases in advertising, feature film exploitation, rental/retail sales and affiliate fees and the non cash impairment charge of $1.5 billion recorded in 2002 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax. These increases were partially offset by the non cash Blockbuster charge of $1.0 billion, net of minority interest and tax, recorded in 2003 and increases in operating expenses primarily from programming and production costs. The substantial improvement in 2002 over 2001 reflected revenue growth principally from advertising sales and the reduction of amortization expense resulting from the implementation of SFAS 142 partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2002. II 9  Segment Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 The tables below present the Companys revenues, operating income and depreciation and amortization by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

II 10 Segment Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 and 2002 vs. 2001 Cable Networks (Basic Cable Television Program Services through MTV Networks ("MTVN"), including MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite, TV Land, MTV2, Spike TV, Comedy Central and CMT; BET and BET Jazz: The Jazz Channel; and through Showtime Networks Inc. ("SNI"), owner of several Premium Subscription Television Program Services) (Contributed 21% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 5,645.5 $ 4,726.7 $ 4,297.6 Operating income (OI) $ 2,172.3 $ 1,772.2 $ 1,234.9 OI as a % of revenues 38% 37% 29% Depreciation and amortization $ 195.3 $ 190.9 $ 447.1 Capital expenditures $ 90.3 $ 95.7 $ 139.9 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Cable Networks revenues increased 19% to $5.6 billion principally driven by 26% growth in advertising revenues and a 9% increase in affiliate fees. Approximately 9% of Cable Networks revenues were generated from international regions, of which approximately 68% came from Europe. Comedy Centrals results have been consolidated in this segment as part of MTVN effective from the date of its acquisition on May 22, 2003. For 2003, advertising revenues increased 26% reflecting 27% growth at MTVN principally due to selling more units and higher average unit rates. BET delivered 17% advertising revenue growth for 2003 over the prior year as a result of higher average rates. The 9% increase in affiliate fees was primarily due to rate and subscriber increases at MTVN and BET partially offset by declines at SNI. Other ancillary revenues for Cable Networks, which represented 9% of revenues for 2003 and 8% for 2002, grew 40% reflecting higher consumer product licensing revenues at Nickelodeon and contributions from co produced feature films. Cable Networks revenue growth benefited from Comedy Central contributions of 8% to advertising, 3% to affiliate and 5% to ancillary revenue growth for the year. During the second quarter of 2003, restructuring charges of $26.4 million were recorded at Cable Networks. These charges principally reflected $17.7 million of severance liabilities resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central that the Company did not own and organizational changes at SNI. Also included in this total was $8.4 million for additional lease termination costs for MTVN due to a change in the initial estimate for its 2001 charge. For 2003, Cable Networks operating income increased 23% reflecting higher revenues partially offset by increased expenses. Operating expenses, principally comprised of programming and production costs for the cable channels, increased 23%, led by increases at MTVN and BET primarily for new programming initiatives and the impact of Comedy Central. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% primarily due to higher marketing costs at MTVN and the inclusion of Comedy Central, which contributed 5% of the increase. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved one percentage point for the year. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% to $4.7 billion principally driven by 12% growth in advertising revenues and 8% growth in affiliate fees. MTVNs advertising revenues increased 11% due to selling more units, partially offset by a reduction of average unit rates. Cable affiliate fees increased 8% II 11 principally due to mid single digit rate increases at MTVNs domestic channels, excluding digital, an 18% increase in domestic subscribers principally due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Noggin and the expansion of MTVN digital channels and mid single digit average rate increases at SNI. Other ancillary revenues were principally comprised of consumer product licensing revenues from Nickelodeon. For 2002, Cable Networks operating income increased 44% as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The increase also reflected the impact of the MTVN charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The MTVN charge reflected $66.6 million for severance due to a reduction in workforce and for lease termination costs. In conjunction with the restructuring, $8.8 million was recorded as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. Operating expenses increased 7% principally driven by higher programming costs at MTV, Nickelodeon, Spike TV and SNI. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% primarily due to higher compensation expense from sales commissions as a result of revenue growth. Television (CBS and UPN Television Networks and Stations; Television Production and Syndication) (Contributed 29% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, 30% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 31% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 7,761.0 $ 7,456.8 $ 7,218.7 Operating income (OI) $ 1,238.1 $ 1,177.6 $ 385.8 OI as a % of revenues 16% 16% 5% Depreciation and amortization $ 151.1 $ 140.8 $ 786.4 Capital expenditures $ 123.6 $ 138.7 $ 120.2 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Television revenues increased 4% to $7.8 billion primarily driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, and higher syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 6%, with 8% growth in CBS primetime due primarily to a 6% average rate increase. Late night, daytime and news advertising revenues were up with average rate increases partially offset by a rate decrease at sports, due primarily to the impact of the war on the broadcast of the NCAA basketball tournament. The Stations group delivered 2% year over year advertising revenue growth led by ratings improvements for the CBS Network, particularly at 10 pm, which improved the stations local news and syndication as well as higher sales in the automotive, leisure and media industries. The Stations group also benefited from the full year results of KCAL TV Los Angeles, acquired in May 2002, which contributed 3% to the revenue growth for the year. These increases were more than offset by the absence of political advertising which was down over 80% versus the prior year. Higher syndication revenues for the year were partially offset by a decrease in domestic syndication availabilities and home entertainment revenues. Syndication revenues were higher primarily due to increases in license fees and barter revenues for THE DR. PHIL SHOW which debuted in September 2002 and higher barter revenues from EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. Revenue from domestic syndication availabilities in 2003 included THE PARKERS, SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH and the off network syndication of seasons one through five of BECKER, and did not match last years initial basic cable syndication availabilities including 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED and SEVEN DAYS. Home entertainment revenues decreased as contributions from the DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE did not match the contributions from last years DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. II 12 For 2003, Television operating income increased 5% principally due to the revenue increases noted above. Operating expenses, principally comprised of production costs and programming expenses, increased 5% for the year. CBS Network experienced higher programming costs due to more hours of original summer programming, contractual series increases in primetime and increased sports rights payments which were associated with the first year of new contracts with both the NCAA and the PGA Tour. The Stations group incurred higher operating expenses for the year principally due to expansion of news coverage and talent partially offset by reduced advertising and promotion. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, remained flat. Television operating income for 2003 included approximately $27 million from insurance recoveries. License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $634.9 million and $668.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including intercompany revenues of $345.2 million and $366.8 million. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Television revenues increased 3% to $7.5 billion principally driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, partially offset by lower syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 2%, with 9% growth for both CBS and UPN in primetime due to 5% average rate increases, partially offset by rate decreases in daytime and news dayparts. CBS Network had additional units available for sale in 2002 versus the prior year when there were fewer units available as a result of the events of September 11, during which CBS ran sustained news coverage from September 11 through September 14, 2001. CBS Network sold approximately 85% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2002/2003 season versus 65% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2001/2002 season. The revenue increases were partially offset by the absence of the Super Bowl, which CBS televised in 2001. The Stations group delivered 12% year over year advertising revenue growth led by increased political ads and higher sales in the automotive and services industries. The acquisition of KCAL TV Los Angeles in May 2002 contributed 5% of the Stations group revenue growth for the year. For 2002, Television revenues also reflected a decrease in domestic and foreign syndication revenues and lower network revenues, partially offset by higher home entertainment revenues. Domestic syndication revenues included revenues from the initial availability to cable of 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED, SISTER, SISTER, and ANY DAY NOW as well as higher library revenues from THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW and HAPPY DAYS. However, these revenues did not match the absence of contributions from the syndication of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and CHEERS in the prior year and license fees from cancelled series including STAR TREK: VOYAGER, DR. LAURA and REAL TV. Foreign syndication revenues were lower primarily resulting from lower current series revenues partially offset by higher revenues from library product. Network revenues decreased as revenues from new series in the 2002/2003 season were more than offset by the absence of revenues from canceled series. Home entertainment revenues were higher primarily from the DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. For 2002, Television operating income increased to $1.2 billion from $385.8 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The increase also reflected the impact of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations. Production and programming expenses at the broadcast networks increased 1.5%, principally reflecting higher costs in primetime due to contractual series increases and higher sports rights offset by lower NFL costs due to the absence of the Super Bowl in 2002. The Stations group incurred higher costs for syndicated programming and sports rights. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. II 13 Radio (Radio Stations) (Contributed 8% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 2,097.6 $ 2,121.6 $ 2,014.8 Operating income (OI) $ 975.0 $ 1,007.6 $ 382.4 OI as a % of revenues 46% 47% 19% Depreciation and amortization $ 27.4 $ 30.8 $ 608.0 Capital expenditures $ 14.1 $ 14.4 $ 12.4 2003 vs. 2002 Radio revenues are generated from 185 domestic radio stations. For 2003, Radio revenues of $2.1 billion reflected a 1% increase in advertising revenues primarily from national sales. The advertising revenue growth was more than offset by lower ancillary revenues principally related to management services provided to Westwood One, an affiliated company. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For 2003, Radio operating income decreased 3% principally due to the revenue decrease and an increase in expenses. Operating expenses, primarily comprised of radio programming expenses including on air talent, program rights amortization and other production costs, increased 7% for the year primarily reflecting contractual talent increases as well as increased sports rights. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3%, reflecting $13 million of insurance recoveries and lower advertising and promotional expenditures for the year. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased one percentage point. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Radio revenues increased 5% to $2.1 billion. Advertising revenues increased 5% driven by an increase in spots sold for the year, with average spot rates increasing slightly. Radio also experienced an increase in ancillary revenues principally related to management services provided to Westwood One. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Radio operating income increased to $1.0 billion from $382 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, offset by incremental expenses associated with acquired sports rights. Outdoor (Outdoor Advertising Properties) (Contributed 7% of consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 1,748.3 $ 1,633.5 $ 1,656.6 Operating income (loss) (OI) $ 207.9 $ 218.0 $ (90.6 ) OI as a % of revenues 12% 13% NM Depreciation and amortization $ 215.9 $ 205.6 $ 617.9 Capital expenditures $ 58.1 $ 67.1 $ 86.9 NM Not meaningful II 14 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Outdoor revenues increased 7% to $1.7 billion reflecting a 17% increase from its European properties and a 2% increase in North America. Revenue growth from its European properties was principally driven by favorable foreign exchange rates. North American results reflected higher revenues from U.S. billboards, driven by an increase in the number of displays, partially offset by lower revenues from the U.S. transit business, due to a decrease in the number of displays and in the average per unit rate, and lower revenues from billboards in Mexico. Approximately 43% of Outdoor revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe, in 2003 compared with 41% in 2002. For 2003, Outdoor operating income decreased 5% to $207.9 million as the revenue increase was more than offset by a 9% increase in total expenses principally due to higher billboard lease costs and sales related expenses as well as in transit guarantees and posting rotation expenses due to shorter campaigns. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased one percentage point for the year. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Outdoor revenues decreased 1% to $1.6 billion due to weakness in the outdoor advertising market during the first half of 2002. The decline in revenues reflected a 5% decrease in domestic revenues, partially offset by a 4% increase in revenues from its European properties. Approximately 41% and 40% of Outdoors revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe, for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Outdoor operating income for 2002 increased to $218.0 million from an operating loss of $90.6 million, as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Operating income also reflected higher guarantee payments on transit contracts in 2002 versus 2001. Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; Consumer Publishing as well as the operation of Theme Parks, Movie Theaters and Music Publishing) (Contributed 15% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and 16% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 4,101.3 $ 3,680.1 $ 3,626.8 Operating income (OI) $ 271.4 $ 358.3 $ 215.3 OI as a % of revenues 7% 10% 6% Depreciation and amortization $ 129.7 $ 120.7 $ 182.8 Capital expenditures $ 66.4 $ 74.6 $ 54.9 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Entertainment revenues increased 11% to $4.1 billion principally reflecting higher Features, Theaters and Consumer Publishing revenues. Approximately 37% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were higher principally due to increased worldwide home entertainment, theatrical and pay television revenues, partially offset by lower network revenues. Worldwide home entertainment revenues included contributions from THE ADVENTURES OF INDIANA JONES THE COMPLETE DVD MOVIE COLLECTION, HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS, THE ITALIAN JOB and LARA CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE. Domestic theatrical revenues were lower than the prior year due in part to fewer titles in domestic theatrical release. Foreign theatrical revenues were higher than the prior year primarily due to contributions from HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS, LARA II 15 CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE and THE ITALIAN JOB. Pay television revenues were higher while network revenues were lower compared to the prior year, both reflecting a change in the mix of titles available. Theaters revenues increased 12% principally due to the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation, higher average admission prices and increased per capita spending, which more than offset a decline in attendance. Parks revenues increased slightly for the year primarily due to a 1% increase in average per capita spending and the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 2% decline in attendance. Publishing revenues increased 3% on the strength of its top selling titles for the year which included "THE ULTIMATE WEIGHT SOLUTION" by Dr. Phil McGraw, "LIVING HISTORY" by Hillary Rodham Clinton and "THE DARK TOWER V (WOLVES OF THE CALLA)" by Stephen King. For 2003, Entertainment operating income decreased 24% to $271.4 million, as the revenue increases noted above were more than offset by increased Features distribution and film amortization costs. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased three percentage points. License fees for television exhibition of completed motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $1.2 and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including intercompany revenues of $281.1 million and $303.7 million. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $3.7 billion principally reflecting higher Publishing, Theaters and Features revenues, partially offset by lower Parks revenues. Approximately 33% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were slightly higher principally due to higher network television, domestic home video, domestic syndication and pay television revenues, which were partially offset by lower worldwide theatrical, foreign syndication, foreign pay television and foreign home video revenues. Domestic theatrical revenues primarily included contributions from the theatrical release of THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, WE WERE SOLDIERS, JACKASS THE MOVIE, CHANGING LANES and STAR TREK NEMESIS. Worldwide home video revenues were higher than last years revenues including contributions from VANILLA SKY, JIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS and WE WERE SOLDIERS. Worldwide home video revenues included increases from the growth in demand for current releases and library titles in the DVD format and an overall decline in the demand for the VHS format. Theaters revenues increased 7% due to higher average admission prices, higher attendance and increased per capita concession spending. Attendance in 2002 increased 3% compared with the prior year. Average admission prices and per capita concession spending both increased 5% over the prior year. Publishing revenues increased 4% primarily due to income from new distribution agreements and higher sales in the Adult Group and Childrens Book and Audio Divisions. The top selling titles for 2002 included "FROM A BUICK 8" by Stephen King, "SELF MATTERS" by Dr. Phil McGraw and "EVERYTHINGS EVENTUAL" also by Stephen King. II 16  For 2002, Entertainment operating income increased 66% to $358.3 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Operating income benefited from the revenue increases noted above and from lower development and overhead costs at Features and lower depreciation expense at Theaters. Video (Home videocassette, DVD and video game rental and retail operations) (Contributed 22% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, 23% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 22% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 5,911.7 $ 5,565.9 $ 5,156.7 Operating income (OI) $ (847.8 ) $ 355.8 $ (219.6 ) OI as a % of revenues NM 6% NM Depreciation and amortization $ 257.9 $ 233.8 $ 423.7 Capital expenditures $ 176.8 $ 140.6 $ 93.1 NM Not meaningful 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Video revenues increased 6% to $5.9 billion as a result of growth in rental and retail revenues. International revenues accounted for 26% of total revenues with 62% from Europe and 20% from Canada. The following is a summary of revenues by category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Rental $ 4,533.5 77 % $ 4,460.4 80 % $ 4,314.7 84 % Retail 1,281.6 22 1,019.7 18 735.2 14 Other 96.6 1 85.8 2 106.8 2 Total revenues $ 5,911.7 100 % $ 5,565.9 100 % $ 5,156.7 100 % The increase in revenues was primarily due to a net increase of 198 company operated stores, favorable exchange rates and the fourth quarter of 2002 acquisitions of GameStation, Inc., a leading games retailer in the United Kingdom, and the remaining interest in joint venture stores in Italy. Worldwide same store revenues decreased 2.2% as a result of a 3.6% decrease in worldwide same store rental revenues, partially offset by a 3.7% increase in worldwide same store retail revenues. The decline in worldwide same store rental revenues was primarily the result of a weaker market worldwide. While the rental market slowed during 2003, retail demand for DVDs and games continued to increase and Blockbuster capitalized on this growth during the first half of 2003. The growth in same store retail revenues slowed during the second half of 2003 as Blockbuster competed against strong same store sales growth in the prior year. During the third and fourth quarters of 2002, Blockbuster implemented several promotions to increase demand for retail product. These initiatives were reduced in 2003 in order to focus on improving profitability. II 17 Rental Revenues For 2003, rental revenues increased 1.6% to $4.5 billion due primarily to increases in movie rental revenues, offset slightly by decreased game rental revenues. The following is a summary of rental revenues by product category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Movie rental: VHS $ 1,435.7 32 % $ 2,190.1 49 % $ 3,057.8 71 % DVD 2,599.7 57 1,741.0 39 799.1 18 Total movie rental 4,035.4 89 3,931.1 88 3,856.9 89 Game rental 498.1 11 529.3 12 457.8 11 Total rental revenues $ 4,533.5 100 % $ 4,460.4 100 % $ 4,314.7 100 % The increase in rental revenues was primarily due to a net increase of 198 company operated stores, favorable exchange rates and the fourth quarter of 2002 acquisition of the remaining interest in joint venture stores in Italy, partially offset by a 3.6% decrease in worldwide same store rental revenues, driven by decreases in both movies and games. The decrease in same store rental revenues was the result of a generally weaker rental market and increased competition from retail DVD sales as compared to prior year. Domestic operations represented 78.6% of rental revenues in 2003 as compared with 81.8% in 2002. Blockbusters rental revenues are generated from the rental of VHS tapes, DVDs, video games and from any eventual sale of previously rented VHS tapes, DVDs and video games. Revenues generated from rental transactions include revenues received in connection with the initial rental of product, as well as revenues related to any continuations of such rentals past the initial rental period, as contemplated by Blockbusters membership agreement. Blockbuster believes the decline in same store rental revenues was in line with the overall industry, reflecting a softening in the movie rental industry during the fourth quarter of 2003 and increased competition from retail DVD sales. Based upon Blockbusters belief that the size of the video rental market has contracted as a result of the competition from DVD sell through, simultaneous availability of rental and retail product and availability of other home video distribution channels, they expect the market to continue to decline slightly in the coming year. Retail Revenues For 2003, retail revenues increased 26% to $1.3 billion due to increases in both movie and game sales. The following is a summary of retail revenues by product category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Movie sales: VHS $ 65.2 5 % $ 128.8 13 % $ 167.9 23 % DVD 516.4 40 370.4 36 178.8 24 Total movie sales 581.6 45 499.2 49 346.7 47 Game sales 305.0 24 164.7 16 31.0 4 General retail 395.0 31 355.8 35 357.5 49 Total retail revenues $ 1,281.6 100 % $ 1,019.7 100 % $ 735.2 100 % Retail revenues continued to grow as a percentage of total revenues during 2003, representing 21.7% of total revenues in 2003, compared with 18.3% of total revenues in 2002. The increase in overall retail II 18 revenues was primarily the result of the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 of GameStation, Inc., favorable exchange rates and an increase in company operated stores. In addition, worldwide same store retail revenues increased 3.7% driven by increases across all categories. Overall, retail revenue growth reflected an increase in units sold, both for movies and games, as well as an increase in the average unit price for movies due to a higher DVD mix, partially offset by a lower average unit price for games. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Blockbuster recorded a non cash charge of approximately $1.3 billion resulting from the application of SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 to reduce the carrying value of its goodwill and other long lived assets which resulted in an operating loss of $847.8 million for full year 2003. The impact of the charge more than offset the increase in gross profit that was driven by the overall growth in revenues and gross margin to 59.6% in 2003 from 57.6% in 2002, with both rental and retail gross margins improving year over year. Blockbuster ended 2003 with 8,867 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 198 company operated stores and 124 franchise stores over December 31, 2002. Viacom currently owns approximately 81.5% of Blockbuster (NYSE: BBI). 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Video revenues increased 8% to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion principally driven by an increase of 5.1% in worldwide same store revenues and a net increase of 495 company operated stores from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. Domestic revenues increased 7% while international revenues increased 13%. International revenues represented approximately 21% of Video revenues, with approximately 55% from Europe and 23% from Canada. Worldwide same store revenues, which includes rental and retail product, increased 5.1% primarily resulting from 32.6% growth in same store retail revenues, and 0.9% growth in same store rental revenues over the prior year. Domestic and international same store revenues increased 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Blockbuster ended 2002 with 8,545 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 495 company operated stores and 69 franchise stores over December 31, 2001. For 2002, Video operating income increased to $355.8 million from a loss of $219.6 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The improvement in operating income was also due to the charge reflected in 2001 results as described below. Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for lease obligations related to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in January 2003. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these lease guarantees. The Company has accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations and the $18.7 million had no impact on the Companys operating results for 2002. During the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster began implementation of a strategic re merchandising plan to allow for an expansion of store space for DVD and other strategic product offerings, which it completed by December 31, 2001. In connection with its plan, Blockbuster disposed of approximately 30% of its rental VHS library in its stores, certain VHS merchandise inventory primarily located in its distribution center and certain games from its rental library in its stores. The net book value of the eliminated inventory, net of proceeds, resulted in a primarily non cash charge of approximately $195.9 million to operating expenses in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Blockbuster also recorded a charge of approximately $26.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to employee, labor and supply and disposal costs to execute the plan. Additionally, $2.6 million was charged to depreciation expense for the write off of fixed assets and $1.9 million was charged below operating income to equity in loss of affiliated companies for the adoption of a similar re merchandising plan at one of Blockbusters joint venture operations. The plan was completed by the end of 2001 through the destruction or sale of the identified items. II 19 Also, during the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster recorded approximately $27.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to two lawsuits. The amounts described above, including $141.7 million recorded as the change in accounting estimates for rental inventory, represented the 2001 pre tax charge of approximately $396.6 million. Financial Position Current assets increased 8% to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2003 from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily due to an increase of $615.3 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $219.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in other current assets of $133.4 million. The increase in accounts receivable was driven primarily by higher fourth quarter revenues from Entertainment as well as increased advertising and affiliate revenues at MTV Networks. Also contributing to this increase was the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central, as well as the timing of customer payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 6.4% at December 31, 2003 compared with 7.0% at December 31, 2002. This decrease reflected improved receivable aging at the end of 2003 and favorable customer settlements during the year. Net property and equipment decreased $120.7 million to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.1 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $896.8 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $534.4 million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $158.8 million and the addition of capital leases of $80.3 million. Goodwill of $57.1 billion decreased $59.5 million from December 31, 2002, reflecting the $1.3 billion non cash charge related to Blockbusters goodwill, partially offset by additional goodwill resulting from acquisitions, primarily the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central. Current liabilities increased $238.8 million to $7.6 billion primarily due to increases of $159.7 million in income taxes payable and $195.4 million in participants share, residuals and royalties payable, primarily for feature films. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $122.3 million, primarily relating to purchases made by Blockbuster at the end of 2002. Total debt, including current maturities, decreased $524.7 million to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2003 principally reflecting the use of cash from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Minority interest of $627.0 million at December 31, 2003 decreased $218.2 million from $845.2 million at December 31, 2002 reflecting the impact on minority owners of the write down of Blockbusters goodwill, as well as the purchases of Blockbuster Class A common stock in 2003 in order to maintain Viacoms consolidated tax position with Blockbuster. Cash Flows Operating Activities. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected net earnings of $1.4 billion adjusted for non cash charges of $1.3 billion and depreciation and amortization of $999.8 million. Additionally, operating cash flow reflected increases in participation liabilities and decreases in other assets offset by increases in receivables noted above and payments of accounts payable. The reduction in accounts payable was largely attributable to the purchases of merchandise inventory by Blockbuster at the end of 2002. Operating cash flow also benefited from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $77.1 million. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected net earnings of $725.7 million adjusted for non cash charges of $1.5 billion for the adoption of SFAS 142 and depreciation and amortization of $945.6 million. Additionally, operating cash flow benefited from the utilization of deferred tax assets of $655 million and from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $210.3 million. These increases were partially offset by an additional investment in Blockbusters merchandise and rental inventory and increased program rights for television series and sports. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected a net loss of $223.5 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of II 20 $3.1 billion, and for the 2001 Blockbuster, MTVN and UPN charges plus decreases in accounts receivable, partially offset by payments of accrued expenses and accounts payable. Cash paid for income taxes of $933.9 million for 2003 was higher than 2002 payments of $630.1 million principally due to higher operating income (excluding the non cash impairment charge) as well as the absence of 2002 non recurring items. The Company anticipates that higher operating income and the absence of non recurring tax attributes in 2004 will result in an increase in cash payments for taxes of approximately $500 million to $700 million over 2003 levels. While the Company does not have direct access to Blockbusters cash flow, should the Company complete the divestiture of Blockbuster in 2004, the Companys operating cash flow would decrease by the amount of their cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Blockbusters operating cash flow was approximately 17% of the Companys consolidated cash flow. Investing Activities. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected acquisitions of $1.3 billion, capital expenditures of $534.4 million principally for video stores, broadcasting equipment and outdoor advertising structures and additional investments of $40.0 million in affiliated companies. Acquisitions primarily consisted of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central, as well as Outdoors acquisition of a billboard operator in Puerto Rico and the purchase of $62.3 million of Blockbuster Class A stock by the Company in order to maintain its ownership interest of at least 80% for tax consolidation purposes. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets totaling $47.3 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected capital expenditures of $537.1 million, additional investments of $60.8 million in affiliated companies and acquisitions of $926.0 million primarily reflecting the acquisition of KCAL TV and the remaining interest in Noggin that the Company did not already own. Activity in 2002 also reflected Blockbusters acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in an Italy joint venture and the acquisition of a games retailer in the United Kingdom. During 2002, the Company acquired shares of Blockbusters Class A common stock for $11.2 million. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets totaling $72.2 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected the acquisitions of BET and outdoor businesses and capital expenditures of $515.4 million partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of radio stations and other assets. Capital expenditures for 2004 are anticipated to be approximately $700 million. The increase over 2003 levels is primarily to support Blockbusters various revenue and profitability growth initiatives, as well as systems and infrastructure improvements. The Company spent $534.4 million during 2003. Capital expenditures are funded with cash flows from operations. Financing Activities. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected the purchase of Company stock for $945.1 million, repayment of notes and debentures of $771.2 million and the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $472.1 million, including payments of financing costs. In addition, the Company paid $104.6 million in dividends to stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2003. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $736.5 million, net of financing costs, and from the exercise of employee stock options of $263.3 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.0 billion, the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $1.2 billion, and the purchase of Company stock for $1.1 billion. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.3 billion and from the exercise of employee stock options of $357.6 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflected the net repayment of debt for $1.6 billion and the purchase of Company stock for $1.1 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $184.6 million. II 21 In 2004, the declarations of a $.06 per share quarterly dividend would result in an annual payment to Viacoms stockholders of approximately $420 million. On January 28, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $.06 per share quarterly dividend payable April 1, 2004 to Viacoms stockholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2004. Stock Purchase Program During 2003, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 23.6 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $981.4 million under its stock purchase programs, of which $545.3 million was spent in the fourth quarter for 13.3 million shares. As of December 31, 2003 there was approximately $1.9 billion remaining under the current $3.0 billion purchase program. From January 1 through March 10, 2004, the Company purchased an additional 8.2 million shares for approximately $336.6 million. During 2002, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 27.8 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.2 billion under its stock purchase programs, of which $350.7 million was spent in the fourth quarter of 2002 for 8.1 million shares. Acquisitions On May 22, 2003, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central that it did not own for $1.2 billion in cash. Comedy Centrals results have been consolidated as part of Cable Networks, effective from the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of approximately $1.1 billion was allocated to goodwill. The final allocation of the purchase price will be based on comprehensive final evaluations of the fair value of Comedy Centrals assets acquired and liabilities assumed. On May 15, 2002, the Company acquired the assets of KCAL TV Los Angeles for approximately $650 million. During 2002, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% interest in Noggin, the 24 hour digital network for kids that it did not already own for approximately $100 million. Blockbuster acquired the 51% interest that it did not already own in a joint venture in Italy and also acquired a games retailer in the United Kingdom for approximately $82.4 million in the aggregate in 2002. Capital Structure At December 31, 2003 2002 Notes payable to banks $ 107.2 $ 423.7 Commercial paper 20.0 174.6 Senior debt 9,474.7 9,530.7 Senior subordinated debt 66.3 56.1 Other notes 26.0 28.6 Obligations under capital leases 387.0 392.2 Total Debt 10,081.2 10,605.9 Less current portion 196.3 199.0 Less discontinued operations debt (a) 201.7 201.7 Total Long Term Debt $ 9,683.2 $ 10,205.2 (a)Included in "Other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. Total debt of $10.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 was 13.8% and 14.5%, respectively, as a percentage of total capitalization of the Company. The senior debt of Viacom Inc. is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary Viacom International Inc. The senior debt and senior subordinated debt of the Companys wholly owned II 22 subsidiaries, CBS Broadcasting Inc. and Go Outdoor Systems Holdings S.A., respectively, are not guaranteed; the aggregate outstanding amount of such debt at December 31, 2003 was $118.5 million. The Companys total debt presented above includes, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, (i) an aggregate unamortized premium of $41.4 million and $49.5 million and (ii) the net change in the carrying value of the debt relating to fair value swaps of $48.2 million and $86.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the following debt issuances, maturities and redemptions occurred: Debt Issuances May 14, 2003, $300.0 million 4.625% senior notes due 2018 May 14, 2003, $450.0 million 5.50% senior debentures due 2033 August 28, 2002, $600.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2012 April 25, 2002, $700.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2007 Interest on all of the above debt instruments is paid semi annually.

The Companys scheduled maturities of long term debt at face value, excluding commercial paper and capital leases, outstanding at December 31, 2003 were as follows: Year of Maturity 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and thereafter Long term debt $ 126.1 $ 1,472.8 $ 801.7 $ 700.2 $ .2 $ 6,483.6 II 23  Viacom Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2003, the Companys credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, totaled $4.65 billion comprised of a $1.7 billion 364 day revolving facility due February 2004, a $1.45 billion revolving facility due May 2005 and a $1.5 billion revolving facility due March 2006 (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). In February 2004, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion 5 year credit facility which replaced the $1.7 billion and $1.45 billion facilities. The terms and conditions of the $3.0 billion facility are substantially similar to the $1.5 billion facility. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the $3.0 billion and $1.5 billion facilities. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined at the Companys option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Companys senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.41 billion in the aggregate. The facilities contain covenants, which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities. The primary purpose of the credit facilities is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2003, the Company had commercial paper borrowings of $20.0 million under its $4.65 billion commercial paper program. The Companys credit facilities supporting the commercial paper borrowings totaled $4.5 billion in February 2004. Borrowings under the program have maturities of less than a year. At December 31, 2003, the Company had classified approximately $21.6 million of commercial paper and other debt scheduled to mature within the next twelve months as long term debt, reflecting its intent and ability, through the existence of unused revolving credit facilities, to refinance this debt on a long term basis. Blockbuster Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2003, Blockbusters credit agreement (the "Blockbuster Credit Agreement") was comprised of a $600.0 million long term revolver due July 1, 2004 and a $100.0 million term loan due in quarterly installments ending July 1, 2004. Blockbuster had $600.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the long term revolver at December 31, 2003. Interest rates under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement are based on the prime rate in the United States or LIBOR (plus a margin, or "LIBOR spread," based on leverage ratios, which is currently 1.25%) at Blockbusters option at the time of borrowing. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2003 for borrowings under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement was 2.4%. A variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver (0.25% at December 31, 2003). The Blockbuster Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment of dividends, purchase of Blockbusters common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, Blockbuster was in compliance with all covenants under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement. Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company had an aggregate of $1.0 billion and $981.9 million, respectively, outstanding under revolving receivable securitization programs. The programs result in the sale of receivables on a non recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable and debt on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these arrangements because they provide an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from the programs were used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The terms of the revolving securitization II 24 arrangements require that the receivable pools subject to the programs meet certain performance ratios. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization programs. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes that its operating cash flow ($3.5 billion in 2003), cash and cash equivalents ($850.7 million at December 31, 2003), borrowing capacity under committed bank facilities (which consisted of unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.41 billion in the aggregate at December 31, 2003), and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, including commitments and contingencies, capital and investing commitments and its financing requirements for the foreseeable future. The funding for commitments to purchase sports programming rights, television and film operations, and talent contracts will come primarily from cash flow from operations. The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include capital expenditures, share purchases, acquisitions, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activity available to meet these needs. Any net cash funding requirements are financed with short term borrowings (primarily commercial paper) and long term debt. Commercial paper borrowings, which also accommodate day to day changes in funding requirements, are backed by committed bank facilities that may be utilized in the event that commercial paper borrowings are not available. The Companys strong credit position, which is reflected by an A /A3 rating, affords access to the capital markets. The Company anticipates that scheduled debt maturities in 2004 will be funded with cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operating activities. There are no provisions in any of the Companys material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in the Companys debt ratings. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock and warrants of Viacom that may be issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 billion. The registration statement was first declared effective on January 8, 2001. The net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by Viacom for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital and capital expenditures, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. To date, the Company has issued $2.385 billion of securities under the shelf registration statement. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company had a total of $759.8 million of long term debt maturities, redemptions and repurchases and issued $750 million of long term debt. The long term debt issuances maintained the Companys unused borrowing capacity and its financial flexibility. II 25 As of December 31, 2003, the Companys significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and thereafter Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 13,199.2 $ 3,555.8 $ 3,972.2 $ 2,152.2 $ 3,519.0 Operating leases (2) 5,436.8 972.0 1,546.1 1,016.9 1,901.8 Guaranteed minimum franchise payments (3) 1,453.5 424.5 620.3 204.7 204.0 Purchase obligations (4) 1,155.9 758.9 238.2 79.7 79.1 Capital lease obligations (including interest) (5) 508.6 102.2 161.7 116.6 128.1 Long term debt obligations (6) 9,584.6 126.1 2,274.5 700.4 6,483.6 Other long term liabilities (7) 1,763.5 1,458.0 192.1 113.4 (1)Programming and talent commitments of the Company include $8.2 billion for the acquisition of sports programming rights, $3.2 billion relating to television, radio and feature film production and acquisitions and $1.1 billion for talent contracts. (2)Includes long term noncancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3)Viacoms outdoor advertising business has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks and stadium signage. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchiser is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. (4)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (5)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders and buildings. (6)Long term debt obligations are presented at face value. (7)Long term contractual obligations, including program liabilities and participations due to producers and residuals. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements primarily consist of the guarantees described below. Guarantees The Company owns a 50% equity interest in United Cinemas International ("UCI"), which operates movie theaters in Europe, Latin America and Asia. As of December 31, 2003, the Company guaranteed approximately $291.9 million of UCIs debt obligations under a revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2004, and $175.6 million of UCIs theater leases. The Company also owns a 50% interest in WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. and Graumans Theatres LLC and guarantees certain theater leases for approximately $13.2 million. The debt and lease guarantees would only be triggered upon non payment by the respective primary obligors. These guarantees are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. Additionally, the Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $348.0 million at December 31, 2003 and are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. The Company is also subject to certain off balance sheet lease guarantees related to the divestitures of certain businesses. In October 1998, Blockbuster Music stores were sold to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. ("Wherehouse"). Some of the leases transferred in connection with this sale had previously been guaranteed either by the Company or its affiliates. The remaining initial terms of these leases expire on various dates through 2007. However, certain leases contain renewal options that can II 26 extend the primary lease term and remain subject to the guarantee. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to any amount paid under these guarantees. On January 21, 2003, Wherehouse filed a petition for protection under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law. Based on information regarding lease and guaranty expirations originally available to Blockbuster in connection with the Wherehouse bankruptcy, Blockbusters estimated a contingent liability of approximately $36.0 million. Of this amount Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 which represented its estimate of the lease guarantee obligation at that time. During 2003, Blockbuster paid approximately $8.2 million associated with the lease guarantee obligation. As of December 31, 2003, Blockbuster estimated its contingent liability for Wherehouse leases to be approximately $12.6 million. Of this amount Blockbuster determined its reserve to be $7.9 million and as a result Blockbuster reduced its original reserve by $2.6 million. The Company had previously accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations. Legal Matters Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had pending approximately 112,280 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 103,800 as of December 31, 2002 and approximately 106,000 as of December 31, 2001. The 2002 and 2001 numbers of claims included approximately 1,100 claims and 7,100 claims, respectively, on inactive dockets in various states which would not be counted as pending under the Companys current methodology. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2003, approximately 82,340 were pending in state courts, 27,400 in federal court and approximately 2,540 were third party claims. During 2003, the Company received approximately 36,990 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 28,500 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs (recovery) in 2003 and 2002 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $(8.7) million and $28 million, respectively. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. If proceeds received in 2003 from commuted insurance policies were excluded from the Companys total costs in 2003, the Companys total costs after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits would have been $56.6 million. Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos, lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure, other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease. Claims identified as cancer remain a small percentage of asbestos claims II 27 pending at December 31, 2003. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities and that these asbestos liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. Antitrust. In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the Company, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries with respect to a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint included federal antitrust and California state law claims. In August 2003, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal court judgment. The Supreme Court of the United States refused plaintiffs petition for writ of certiorari in March 2004. In February 2003, a similar complaint that had been filed in a Los Angeles County Superior Court was also dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the California state court dismissal, as well as a prior denial of class certification. The Company believes that the plaintiffs positions in these litigations are without merit and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in the litigations. Blockbuster Securities Actions. During February and March 2003, putative class action complaints were filed against Blockbuster in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. A director and certain officers of Blockbuster were also named as defendants. The remaining putative class actions have been consolidated into one action styled In re Blockbuster Inc. Securities Litigation, which is pending in the same court. The consolidated amended complaint, filed July 2003, claims violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the time period approximately between February and December 2002. It also generally alleges that the defendants made untrue statements of material fact and or omitted to disclose material facts about Blockbusters business and operations, that the value of Blockbusters common stock was therefore artificially inflated and that certain of the individual defendants sold shares of Blockbusters common stock at inflated prices. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. In addition, three shareholder derivative actions were filed in February, March and April 2003, of which one is pending in federal court in Texas and two have been consolidated into one action in Texas state court, each arising from substantially similar operative facts. These shareholder derivative actions include claims for breach of fiduciary duties for various time periods beginning in February 2002 and name certain Blockbuster officers and directors, some of whom are directors and or executive officers of the Company, as individual defendants, and Blockbuster as a nominal defendant. The Company and Blockbuster believe the plaintiffs positions in all of these actions are without merit and Blockbuster intends to vigorously defend these matters. Other. In December 2002, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Blockbuster had breached the revenue sharing agreement between the two parties. Buena Vista claims damages in excess of $120 million. Blockbuster has answered and asserted counterclaims for reformation and breach of contract. On July 22, 2003, the California federal court granted Buena Vistas motion for partial summary judgment, stating in its ruling that a liquidated damages provision in the contract is enforceable. The court reaffirmed its ruling when it denied Blockbusters motion for reconsideration in February 2004. Blockbuster has several remaining defenses to the claims asserted by Buena Vista. Blockbuster and the Company believe the plaintiffs position is without merit, and intend to vigorously defend this matter. II 28 Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that all of the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business with companies in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the non designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of "Other items, net". The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2003, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $296.9 million, of which $12.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $284.9 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. At December 31, 2002, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $266.0 million, of which $49.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $217.0 million represented hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is exposed to movements in short term rates. Swap agreements are used to modify this exposure. This includes both fixed to variable rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, and variable to fixed rate swaps, which are designed as cash flow hedges. Based on the amount of variable rate debt and receivable securitization programs outstanding at December 31, 2003, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause a $23.8 million change to pre tax earnings. As of December 31, 2003 if all parties were to agree, the swaps could have been terminated by a net payment from the counterparties of approximately $47.6 million. The Company has entered into cash flow swap agreements which effectively converted variable rate interest payments on commercial paper to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount outstanding relating to these agreements was approximately $19.4 million and the swap agreements mature in September 2004. Interest is received based upon three month LIBOR and is paid at approximately 5.07%. The amount of the ineffectiveness of these cash flow hedges that was reflected in earnings was immaterial. The effective portion of the change in value of cash flow hedges is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During the next twelve months, approximately $.5 million will be amortized into earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedges included in earnings was not material. The change in value of the fair value hedges and the hedged instruments is reported in earnings for the periods presented. II 29 On May 14, 2003, the Company entered into additional $300 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2018 and the Company receives interest at approximately 4.55% and pays three month LIBOR. On April 25, 2002, the Company entered into additional $700 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2007 and the Company receives interest at approximately 5.11% on $400 million and 5.35% on $300 million, and pays three month LIBOR. During December 2001, the Company entered into $750 million notional amount of swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. Of the $750 million notional amount, $225 million received interest at approximately 3.2% and was to mature on January 15, 2003 and $275 million received interest at approximately 3.8% and was to mature on September 1, 2003. These swaps were terminated in November 2002 resulting in the Company receiving $8.7 million in cash which was amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the respective debt. These fair value hedges were fully effective. The remaining $250 million in notional amount matures on June 1, 2005 and receives interest at approximately 4.5%. These fair value hedges are fully effective. All the swaps paid or pay interest based on three month LIBOR. Credit Risk The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. The Companys receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2003 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Companys products and services are sold. Related Parties National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") is a closely held corporation that beneficially owns the Companys Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 71% of the voting power of all classes of the Companys Common Stock, and approximately 11% of the Companys Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis at December 31, 2003. Owners of the Companys Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. The Companys Class B Common Stock does not have voting rights. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios including Paramount Pictures, a division of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, NAI made payments to Paramount Pictures in the aggregate amounts of approximately $9.6 million, $12.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. NAI and Mr. Redstone owned in the aggregate approximately 30% of the common stock of Midway Games Inc. ("Midway") as of December 31, 2003. Midway sells home video games to Blockbuster and also places advertisements on various of the Companys cable networks from time to time. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, transactions with Midway totaled approximately $9.9 million, $12.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively. The Company owns a minority equity interest in Westwood One, Inc. ("Westwood One"). Most of Infinitys radio stations are affiliated with Westwood One, and Westwood One distributes nationally certain of the Companys radio programming. In connection with these arrangements, the Company receives affiliation fees as well as programming cost reimbursements and in certain instances, shares in revenue II 30 from the sale by Westwood One of Infinitys programming. In addition, certain employees of Infinity serve as officers of Westwood One for which the Company receives a management fee. CBS Television and Cable Networks also enter into programming agreements with Westwood One. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $85.5 million, $127.7 million and $104.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Recent Pronouncements In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The adoption of SFAS 150 as of July 1, 2003 did not have any effect on the Companys financial position. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51" which was replaced in December 2003 by the issuance of FIN 46R ("FIN 46R"). FIN 46R explains how to identify variable interest entities ("VIEs") and how a company should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46R requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. The provisions of FIN 46R are effective for special purpose entities (SPEs) as of December 31, 2003. The Company has completed its review of its special purpose entities under FIN 46R and has determined that the application of FIN 46R did not impact the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows. The provisions of FIN 46R must be applied to VIEs as of March 31, 2004. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of the remaining provisions of FIN 46R will have on the Company. Critical Accounting Policies Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates. Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with SOP 00 2, which requires managements judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments. The cost of Blockbusters rental library, which includes videocassettes, DVDs and games, is amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 12 months to an estimated residual value of $2 to $5 per II 31 unit, according to the product category. The estimates for useful lives and residual values of the rental library are continually evaluated based on changes in consumer demand. Changes in demand or buying patterns may impact the carrying value of the rental library and rental margins. During 2001, Blockbuster changed the estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for videocassettes and game products, which resulted in inventory write downs and increased amortization expense. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142 and a non cash charge would be required. Balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to taxes, legal issues, restructuring charges and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments and estimates by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued businesses, including environmental and asbestos are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled. The Company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. For 2003, the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension plans decreased as a result of plan assets producing a return higher than the expected return due to the market conditions in 2003 partially offset by lowering the discount rate for the Companys major plans from 6.5% in 2002 to 6.0% in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the total accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of the corresponding plan assets and therefore, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability of $773.8 million. As of December 31, 2002, such pension liability was $865.0 million. Risk Factors The risk factors listed below, in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report, could affect the business and future results of the Company. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its over the air networks, basic cable networks, television stations, radio stations and outdoor businesses. The sale of advertising is affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising. Adverse changes to any of these factors, including as a result of acts of terrorism or war, could have a negative effect on revenues. II 32 The Companys basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent upon affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home satellite services ("DTH") distributors on acceptable terms. The loss of carriage on such distributors, or continued carriage on less favorable terms, could adversely affect, with respect to basic cable networks, revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising and, with respect to premium subscription television networks, subscriber fee revenues. In addition, continued consolidation among cable and or DTH distributors and vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business, could have an adverse effect on subscriber fees and advertising revenues, as the Companys ability to launch new networks or maintain or obtain additional distribution for existing networks is impacted by these factors. Operating results derived from the Companys motion picture and television production businesses fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public, which are difficult to predict. Motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent, reduced availability of co financing opportunities, and other factors have resulted in higher production costs. In addition, the commercial success of the Companys motion picture and television productions depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions, and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142 and a non cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a significant effect on the Companys reported net earnings. The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized pursuing the divestiture of Viacoms approximately 81.5% interest in Blockbuster, and the Company, while continuing to consider other alternatives, anticipates that the divestiture would be achieved through a tax free split off. The Company may determine, for market or other reasons, not to effectuate the divestiture of Blockbuster, or a split off of Blockbuster, if it does occur, may be taxable. In addition, should the Company complete a divestiture of Blockbuster, if the fair value of Blockbuster at the date of divestiture were below book value, a loss would be recognized. Such a loss could have a significant effect on the Companys reported net earnings. While the Company seeks to ensure compliance with FCC indecency laws and regulations, the definition of "indecency" is subject to interpretation and there can be no assurance that employees of the Company will not make decisions resulting in the broadcast of programming that does not meet such standards. Such programming could subject the Company to regulatory review or investigation, fines, adverse publicity or other sanctions including the loss of station licenses. Technology developments, including digital copying and file compression, and the growing penetration of high bandwidth Internet connections, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. The Company takes actions to vigorously enforce its rights and protect its copyrighted materials and products, however there can be no assurance that it will be successful in preventing the distribution of pirated content. Increased piracy of the Companys copyrighted materials could negatively affect its operations and financial results. Advances in technologies such as personal video recorders and video on demand and changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these or other technologies could have an adverse effect on the Companys businesses, particularly its television and video businesses. II 33 The Company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued businesses, including environmental liabilities, liabilities related to illnesses of former employees and other pending and threatened litigation. While the pending or threatened litigations and environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance in this regard. The Companys home video retail business currently enjoys a competitive advantage over most other movie distribution channels, except theatrical releases, due to the early timing of the video retailer "distribution window." The video business could be negatively affected if the video retail distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release; the length of the video retail distribution window were shortened; or the video retail distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now. The Company believes that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable video retail industry; however, the order, length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie and the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of any future decisions by the studios. Increased studio licensing of product to video on demand and similar services might impact their decisions with respect to the timing and exclusivity of the video retailer distribution window with possible adverse effect on the Video business. The Company cannot control or predict with certainty studio pricing policies for DVD and VHS product. Current studio policies reducing the pricing of movies released to DVDs and an increasing percentage of VHS titles allow for an affordable sales price by the retailer to the consumer from the beginning of the home video distribution window. This lower "sell through" pricing has led to increased competition from other retailers, including mass merchants and online retailers who are able to purchase DVDs for sale to consumers at the same time as traditional video retailers purchase both DVDs and videocassettes for rental. If sell through pricing, increased competition and consumer interest in building personal DVD libraries cause consumers to increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies, the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to increase rental market share, to replace profits from rentals with profits from sales of sell through product, or to otherwise positively affect gross profits. In addition, if studios make future changes in their pricing policies, which could include pricing rental windows for DVDs or expanded exploitation by studios of any international copyright laws that allow studios to charge retailers more for DVD and VHS rental product than for sell through product, the profitability of the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to enter into arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations. The Companys operating results fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases, as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition. NAI, through its ownership of the Companys Class A common stock, has voting control of the Company. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require shareholder approval, including the election of directors, issuance of securities and transactions involving a change of control. During 2003, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with each of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer which addresses the specific responsibilities of each position. There can be no assurance that either of these executives will remain with the Company for the full term of his employment agreement. A departure of either of these executives, or of other key executives of the Company, could have an adverse effect on the Company. In the operation of its businesses, the Company engages the services of writers, directors, actors and others, which are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages and or higher costs in connection with these agreements could adversely impact the Companys operations. II 34 Changes in laws and regulations, including in particular FCC ownership and indecency rules, could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the operations and ownership of the Companys properties. Some of the Companys businesses are seasonal. The home video rental and retail business and the consumer publishing business are subject to increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays, while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is generated from May through September. In addition, the home video and theme parks businesses revenues are influenced by weather. The Companys radio and outdoor advertising businesses experience fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers. These risk factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the Company. Other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors also could have material adverse effects on the Companys future results.

Outdoor revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales. Outdoor contributed 7% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment includes PARAMOUNT PICTURES, which produces and distributes theatrical motion pictures; SIMON & SCHUSTER, which publishes and distributes consumer books, under imprints such as SIMON & SCHUSTER, POCKET BOOKS, SCRIBNER and THE FREE PRESS; PARAMOUNT PARKS, which is principally engaged in the ownership and operation of five theme parks and a themed attraction in the U.S. and Canada; and movie theater and music publishing operations. Entertainment revenues are generated primarily from feature film exploitation, publishing, theme park operations and movie theaters. Entertainment contributed 15% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and 16% for the year ended December 31, 2001. VIDEO: The Video segment consists of an approximately 81.5% equity interest in Blockbuster Inc., which operates and franchises 8,867 BLOCKBUSTER video stores worldwide. Video revenues are generated primarily from its rental and retail sales of videocassettes ("VHS"), DVDs and games. Video contributed 22%, 23% and 22%, respectively, to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. II 3 On February 10, 2004, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the Company to pursue the divestiture of Viacoms approximately 81.5% interest in Blockbuster, based on the conclusion that Blockbuster would be better positioned as a company completely independent of Viacom. The Company anticipates that the divestiture would be achieved through a tax free split off, but will also continue to consider other alternatives. The transaction is subject to further approval of the Viacom Board and an assessment of market conditions. The split off, which would result in a reduction of Viacoms outstanding shares, is expected to be completed by mid 2004. Consolidated Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 and 2002 vs. 2001 Revenues For the year ended December 31, 2003, revenues of $26.6 billion increased 8% from $24.6 billion in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, revenues of $24.6 billion increased 6% from $23.2 billion in 2001. Revenue growth for each year primarily reflected increases in advertising sales, rental/retail sales and affiliate fees, along with continuing contributions from feature film exploitation. The table below presents the Companys consolidated revenues by type and the percentage and amount of contribution of each type of revenue to consolidated revenues, net of intercompany eliminations, for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenues by Type Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Advertising sales $ 12,071.9 45 % $ 11,225.1 46 % $ 10,722.8 46 % Rental/retail sales 5,815.1 22 5,480.1 22 5,049.9 22 Affiliate fees 2,407.7 9 2,199.0 9 2,030.9 9 Feature film exploitation 2,212.4 8 1,860.0 7 1,853.6 8 TV license fees 1,514.5 6 1,472.2 6 1,359.2 6 Other 2,563.7 10 2,369.3 10 2,206.4 9 Total Revenues $ 26,585.3 100 % $ 24,605.7 100 % $ 23,222.8 100 % Advertising sales, which represented 45% of the Companys consolidated revenues for 2003, increased 8% in 2003 to $12.1 billion reflecting growth in all of the Companys segments which generate advertising revenues: Cable Networks, Television, Radio and Outdoor. The increase in advertising revenues was due to increased units sold and higher rates at the cable and broadcast networks and 7% higher U.S. billboard and 17% higher European outdoor revenues primarily driven by favorable exchange rates. For 2002, advertising sales increased 5% to $11.2 billion led by increases in Cable Networks, Television and Radio. The 2002 increase in advertising revenues was driven primarily by increased units sold at cable networks, as well as increases in average unit rates and units sold at the broadcast network operations. Rental/retail sales for 2003 were up 6% to $5.8 billion reflecting a 26% increase in retail sales and a 2% increase in rental sales. Both rental and retail growth were driven by an increase of 198 worldwide company operated stores since December 31, 2002, the acquisition of GameStation, Inc., a leading games retailer in the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of 2002 and favorable foreign exchange rates. Worldwide same store revenues declined 2.2% reflecting a 3.6% decline in same store rental revenues as a result of a weaker rental market worldwide partially offset by an increase in same store retail revenues of 3.7% reflecting growth in both movie and games sales. Rental/retail sales for 2002 were up 9% to $5.5 billion with rental sales growth of 3% and retail sales growth of 39% driven by an increase of 495 worldwide company operated stores since December 31, 2001 and increased DVD and game product sales. Affiliate fees for 2003 increased 9% to $2.4 billion primarily driven by rate increases and growth in subscriber volume at MTVN as well as the acquisition of Comedy Central in May 2003. Affiliate fees for II 4 2002 increased 8% to $2.2 billion reflecting rate increases at each of the Cable Networks as well as an increase in subscriber volume at MTV Networks digital channels. Feature film revenues increased 19% to $2.2 billion in 2003 primarily reflecting 62% higher worldwide home entertainment revenues from DVD sales and contributions from increased syndication, theatrical and pay television revenues partially offset by lower network revenues. Feature film revenues remained relatively flat in 2002 versus 2001 at $1.9 billion reflecting growth in DVD sales primarily offset by lower theatrical revenues. Television license fees increased 3% to $1.5 billion in 2003 principally reflecting increased syndication revenues due to a full year of results for THE DR. PHIL SHOW versus four months in 2002. Television license fee revenues increased 8% in 2002 to $1.5 billion primarily from increased syndication revenues from cable sales and revenues from THE DR. PHIL SHOW, launched in 2002. Other revenues, which include revenues from publishing, theme park operations, movie theaters and consumer products, increased 8% to $2.6 billion in 2003 primarily reflecting higher Nickelodeon consumer products revenues as well as higher theaters revenues from favorable foreign currency translation, higher admission prices and increased per capita spending. For 2002, other revenues increased 7% to $2.4 billion primarily due to higher publishing, theaters and Nickelodeon consumer products revenues. The Companys 2004 revenues are expected to benefit from the continued strengthening of the advertising market and from the Super Bowl telecast on CBS in February, as well as the full year impact of the Comedy Central acquisition. Assuming the divestiture of Blockbuster occurs, the Companys advertising supported businesses as a percentage of consolidated revenues would significantly increase. International Revenues The Company generated approximately 18% of its total revenues from international regions in 2003 and 16% in 2002 and 2001, principally from Europe and Canada. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Europe $ 2,839.8 58 % $ 2,263.4 56 % $ 2,030.6 54 % Canada 1,087.1 22 927.2 23 881.7 23 All other 960.1 20 838.6 21 844.0 23 Total International Revenues $ 4,887.0 100 % $ 4,029.2 100 % $ 3,756.3 100 % Operating Expenses For the year ended December 31, 2003, operating expenses of $16.3 billion increased 9% over 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, operating expenses of $14.9 billion increased 3% over 2001. The major components and changes in operating expenses were as follows: Production and program rights amortization expenses represented approximately 47% of total operating expenses in 2003 and reflect the costs and amortization of television and theatrical inventory, including direct production costs, residuals and participation expenses, production overhead and acquisition costs as well as costs attributable to television and radio programming expenses including on air talent and other production costs, and costs and amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast networks, cable networks and broadcast stations. For 2003, production and program rights amortization increased 11% over 2002 primarily due to 22% higher costs at Cable Networks, principally for new and existing programming at MTVN. Also contributing to the increases were higher costs for contractual series at the broadcast networks and more original summer programming, higher sports rights amortization at CBS Network and Radio II 5 and higher feature film amortization. Production and program rights amortization expenses for 2002 increased 4% over 2001 driven by contractual increases in costs associated with series at the broadcast networks and increases at the Company owned television stations due to new entertainment and sports programming investments. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses represented approximately 27% of total operating expenses in 2003 and include amortization of the costs of videocassette, DVD and game inventory, revenue sharing expenses on rental inventory, store employee compensation expense and occupancy expenses. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2003 increased 6% over 2002 reflecting an increase in rental/retail sales of 6%, an increase of 198 worldwide company operated stores partially offset by improved product buying and inventory management. Costs of rental/retail sales and other video store operating expenses for 2002 increased 1% over 2001 reflecting a shift in product mix and the net increase of 495 worldwide company operated stores, partially offset by the 2001 charge associated with Blockbusters re merchandising and store reconfiguration plans. Distribution expenses, which represented approximately 9% of total operating expenses in 2003, reflect advertising and other distribution costs incurred primarily with respect to theatrical and television product. Distribution expenses for 2003 increased 11% over 2002 reflecting higher print and advertising costs for feature films in theatrical release. Distribution expenses for 2002 increased 8% over 2001 reflecting higher costs associated with prints and advertising due to the higher number of feature films released partially offset by a decrease in other distribution costs. Other operating expenses for 2003, included an increase in Outdoor expenses of 7%, reflecting higher rotation and embellishment expenses for billboards. Outdoor expenses for 2002 increased 10% over 2001 reflecting higher guarantee payments for transit contracts. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses, which include expenses incurred to provide back office support, occupancy, selling and marketing costs, increased 4% to $4.4 billion in 2003 reflecting increased costs from Comedy Central, acquired in May 2003, increased employee related expenses and higher directors and officers insurance premiums and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by a pre tax gain of $40 million received in 2003 from the settlement of a 2001 physical damage and business interruption claim. For 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% to $4.2 billion. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 16% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 17% for 2002 and 18% for 2001. Advertising expenses remained relatively flat at $1.4 billion for 2003 and 2002 reflecting higher advertising costs for feature films in theatrical release offset by decreases at Blockbuster. Advertising expenses decreased 5% in 2002 versus 2001 reflecting lower advertising spending at the broadcast and cable networks and Company owned television stations partially offset by increases at Blockbuster for marketing efforts associated with key rental and retail promotions. Included within selling, general and administrative expenses are residual costs, which primarily include pension and postretirement benefit costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. Residual costs for 2003 increased to $146.5 million from $67.8 million principally due to actuarial losses from a lower discount rate and a decrease in expected rate of return on plan assets in 2003. Residual costs decreased to $67.8 million in 2002 from $87.2 million in 2001 due primarily to the recognition of actuarial gains for benefit plans of certain divested businesses. II 6 Impairment and Restructuring Charges During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a non cash impairment charge related to Blockbuster of approximately $1.3 billion in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. In completing its analysis of the fair value of the video business during the fourth quarter of 2003, several events led Blockbuster to conclude that the business had incremental risks that were required to be included in its evaluation of goodwill. These events included Blockbusters lower than anticipated same store revenues during the December 2003 selling season caused by increased competition from retail DVD and other home video distribution channels. Blockbuster also identified risks associated with certain international operations, such as increased competition, two tiered pricing and piracy. Additionally, Blockbusters review of long lived assets in conjunction with SFAS 144 resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $18.5 million to reduce the carrying value of certain fixed assets in four international markets. These charges were included in "Impairment and restructuring charges" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, restructuring charges of $26.4 million were recorded at Cable Networks. These charges principally reflected $17.7 million of severance liabilities resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Comedy Central that the Company did not own and organizational changes at Showtime Networks Inc. Also included in this total was $8.4 million for additional lease termination costs for MTVN due to a change in the initial estimate for its 2001 charge. In 2001, the Company recorded a Cable Networks restructuring charge of $66.6 million for MTVN and a UPN restructuring charge of $52.8 million. These charges were principally associated with reducing headcount and closing certain MTVN domestic and foreign offices and integrating UPN into CBS Network operations. Depreciation and Amortization For the year ended December 31, 2003, depreciation and amortization increased 6% to $999.8 million principally driven by an increase of 198 company operated video stores and the addition of broadcasting equipment and outdoor advertising properties. For the year ended December 31, 2002, depreciation and amortization decreased to $945.6 million as compared with $3.1 billion for 2001. This decrease was due to the Companys initial adoption of SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002, and as a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized. Interest Expense For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest expense decreased 9% to $776.0 million from $848.3 million primarily due to a reduction in debt including lower average commercial paper borrowings. The Company had approximately $10.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at weighted average interest rates of 6.5% and 6.6%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest expense decreased 12% to $848.3 million from $969.2 million due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates. The Company had approximately $11.5 billion at December 31, 2001 of principal amount of debt outstanding (including current maturities and discontinued operations) at a weighted average interest rate of 6.8%. Interest Income For the year ended December 31, 2003, interest income decreased to $14.8 million from $15.8 million in 2002. For the year ended December 31, 2002, interest income decreased to $15.8 million from $30.6 million in 2001 due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in 2002 versus 2001. II 7 Other Items, Net For the year ended December 31, 2003, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $3.4 million principally consisting of foreign exchange losses of $2.3 million, losses associated with securitizing trade receivables of $14.8 million and an aggregate loss of $7.0 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value, partially offset by a net gain on the disposition of investments of $14.8 million and an insurance recoupment of $5.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2002, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $30.0 million which principally consisted of foreign exchange losses of $51.9 million, losses of $19.7 million associated with securitizing trade receivables and an aggregate loss of approximately $13.8 million resulting from the write down of several investments to their market value. These losses were partially offset by the recovery of advertising commitments of $29.8 million, a gain of $18.8 million on the sale of a telephone kiosk advertising business and a net gain of $5.5 million from the sale of investments. For the year ended December 31, 2001, "Other items, net" of $254.7 million principally reflected a gain from television station swaps of $210.1 million and the recovery of certain advertising commitments of $250.0 million offset by impairment losses of approximately $125.0 million related to the Companys investments. The one time pre tax gains were also partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $8.2 million and losses of $22.8 million associated with securitizing trade receivables. Additionally, 2001 reflects an impairment loss of $46.6 million related to the purchase of two television stations. The recovery of advertising commitments in 2002 and 2001 reflected the restructuring of agreements with several Internet companies. As a result, the Company was released from related advertising commitments and reversed related deferred revenues. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. For 2003, the annual effective tax rate, before the cumulative effect of change in accounting was 55.9% in 2003, 38.8% in 2002 and 118.5% in 2001. The annual 2003 rate was adversely affected by the non cash charge recorded to reduce the carrying value of Blockbuster goodwill. Excluding the non cash charge, the annual effective tax rate was 39.8% in 2003. The annual 2001 rate was adversely affected by non deductible goodwill amortization. Equity in Loss of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax "Equity in loss of affiliated companies, net of tax" was $.6 million for 2003, $39.5 million for 2002 and $127.0 million for 2001. The amounts principally reflected operating losses from Internet investments and international ventures partially offset by positive results of Westwood One and Comedy Central prior to its acquisition in May 2003. Additionally, 2001 reflected operating losses from Internet equity investments that were no longer operating in 2002. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest for 2003 and 2002 primarily represented the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Minority interest increased in 2003 principally due to recording the minority interest portion of the 2003 Blockbuster non cash charge. Minority interest for 2001 primarily represented the minority ownership of Infinity prior to its merger with the Company on February 21, 2001, and the minority ownership of Blockbuster. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest and Tax Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" which requires the capitalization of asset retirement costs as part of the total cost of the II 8 related long lived asset and the depreciation of this cost over the corresponding assets useful life. As a result of the adoption, the Company recorded a charge of $18.5 million, or $.01 per share, reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2003. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142 and recorded an after tax non cash charge of $1.5 billion (net of minority interest of $336.1 million), or $.84 per basic and $.83 per diluted share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Net Earnings (Loss) The Company reported net earnings of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 versus net earnings of $725.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and a net loss of $223.5 million for 2001. The improvement in net earnings in 2003 was primarily due to revenue growth from increases in advertising, feature film exploitation, rental/retail sales and affiliate fees and the non cash impairment charge of $1.5 billion recorded in 2002 as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of minority interest and tax. These increases were partially offset by the non cash Blockbuster charge of $1.0 billion, net of minority interest and tax, recorded in 2003 and increases in operating expenses primarily from programming and production costs. The substantial improvement in 2002 over 2001 reflected revenue growth principally from advertising sales and the reduction of amortization expense resulting from the implementation of SFAS 142 partially offset by the goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2002. II 9  Segment Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 The tables below present the Companys revenues, operating income and depreciation and amortization by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

(c)Eliminations in all periods principally reflect the timing of intercompany transactions from the sale of television product to Cable Networks and the sale of feature films to cable and broadcast networks and the Video segment. II 10 Segment Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 and 2002 vs. 2001 Cable Networks (Basic Cable Television Program Services through MTV Networks ("MTVN"), including MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite, TV Land, MTV2, Spike TV, Comedy Central and CMT; BET and BET Jazz: The Jazz Channel; and through Showtime Networks Inc. ("SNI"), owner of several Premium Subscription Television Program Services) (Contributed 21% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 19% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 5,645.5 $ 4,726.7 $ 4,297.6 Operating income (OI) $ 2,172.3 $ 1,772.2 $ 1,234.9 OI as a % of revenues 38% 37% 29% Depreciation and amortization $ 195.3 $ 190.9 $ 447.1 Capital expenditures $ 90.3 $ 95.7 $ 139.9 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Cable Networks revenues increased 19% to $5.6 billion principally driven by 26% growth in advertising revenues and a 9% increase in affiliate fees. Approximately 9% of Cable Networks revenues were generated from international regions, of which approximately 68% came from Europe. Comedy Centrals results have been consolidated in this segment as part of MTVN effective from the date of its acquisition on May 22, 2003. For 2003, advertising revenues increased 26% reflecting 27% growth at MTVN principally due to selling more units and higher average unit rates. BET delivered 17% advertising revenue growth for 2003 over the prior year as a result of higher average rates. The 9% increase in affiliate fees was primarily due to rate and subscriber increases at MTVN and BET partially offset by declines at SNI. Other ancillary revenues for Cable Networks, which represented 9% of revenues for 2003 and 8% for 2002, grew 40% reflecting higher consumer product licensing revenues at Nickelodeon and contributions from co produced feature films. Cable Networks revenue growth benefited from Comedy Central contributions of 8% to advertising, 3% to affiliate and 5% to ancillary revenue growth for the year. During the second quarter of 2003, restructuring charges of $26.4 million were recorded at Cable Networks. These charges principally reflected $17.7 million of severance liabilities resulting from the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central that the Company did not own and organizational changes at SNI. Also included in this total was $8.4 million for additional lease termination costs for MTVN due to a change in the initial estimate for its 2001 charge. For 2003, Cable Networks operating income increased 23% reflecting higher revenues partially offset by increased expenses. Operating expenses, principally comprised of programming and production costs for the cable channels, increased 23%, led by increases at MTVN and BET primarily for new programming initiatives and the impact of Comedy Central. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% primarily due to higher marketing costs at MTVN and the inclusion of Comedy Central, which contributed 5% of the increase. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved one percentage point for the year. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% to $4.7 billion principally driven by 12% growth in advertising revenues and 8% growth in affiliate fees. MTVNs advertising revenues increased 11% due to selling more units, partially offset by a reduction of average unit rates. Cable affiliate fees increased 8% II 11 principally due to mid single digit rate increases at MTVNs domestic channels, excluding digital, an 18% increase in domestic subscribers principally due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Noggin and the expansion of MTVN digital channels and mid single digit average rate increases at SNI. Other ancillary revenues were principally comprised of consumer product licensing revenues from Nickelodeon. For 2002, Cable Networks operating income increased 44% as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The increase also reflected the impact of the MTVN charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. The MTVN charge reflected $66.6 million for severance due to a reduction in workforce and for lease termination costs. In conjunction with the restructuring, $8.8 million was recorded as depreciation expense for the write off of leasehold improvements. Operating expenses increased 7% principally driven by higher programming costs at MTV, Nickelodeon, Spike TV and SNI. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% primarily due to higher compensation expense from sales commissions as a result of revenue growth. Television (CBS and UPN Television Networks and Stations; Television Production and Syndication) (Contributed 29% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, 30% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 31% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 7,761.0 $ 7,456.8 $ 7,218.7 Operating income (OI) $ 1,238.1 $ 1,177.6 $ 385.8 OI as a % of revenues 16% 16% 5% Depreciation and amortization $ 151.1 $ 140.8 $ 786.4 Capital expenditures $ 123.6 $ 138.7 $ 120.2 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Television revenues increased 4% to $7.8 billion primarily driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, and higher syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 6%, with 8% growth in CBS primetime due primarily to a 6% average rate increase. Late night, daytime and news advertising revenues were up with average rate increases partially offset by a rate decrease at sports, due primarily to the impact of the war on the broadcast of the NCAA basketball tournament. The Stations group delivered 2% year over year advertising revenue growth led by ratings improvements for the CBS Network, particularly at 10 pm, which improved the stations local news and syndication as well as higher sales in the automotive, leisure and media industries. The Stations group also benefited from the full year results of KCAL TV Los Angeles, acquired in May 2002, which contributed 3% to the revenue growth for the year. These increases were more than offset by the absence of political advertising which was down over 80% versus the prior year. Higher syndication revenues for the year were partially offset by a decrease in domestic syndication availabilities and home entertainment revenues. Syndication revenues were higher primarily due to increases in license fees and barter revenues for THE DR. PHIL SHOW which debuted in September 2002 and higher barter revenues from EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND. Revenue from domestic syndication availabilities in 2003 included THE PARKERS, SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH and the off network syndication of seasons one through five of BECKER, and did not match last years initial basic cable syndication availabilities including 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED and SEVEN DAYS. Home entertainment revenues decreased as contributions from the DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE did not match the contributions from last years DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. II 12 For 2003, Television operating income increased 5% principally due to the revenue increases noted above. Operating expenses, principally comprised of production costs and programming expenses, increased 5% for the year. CBS Network experienced higher programming costs due to more hours of original summer programming, contractual series increases in primetime and increased sports rights payments which were associated with the first year of new contracts with both the NCAA and the PGA Tour. The Stations group incurred higher operating expenses for the year principally due to expansion of news coverage and talent partially offset by reduced advertising and promotion. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, remained flat. Television operating income for 2003 included approximately $27 million from insurance recoveries. License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on basic cable are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $634.9 million and $668.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including intercompany revenues of $345.2 million and $366.8 million. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Television revenues increased 3% to $7.5 billion principally driven by higher advertising revenues at the broadcast networks and the Stations group, partially offset by lower syndication revenues. CBS and UPN Networks combined advertising revenues increased 2%, with 9% growth for both CBS and UPN in primetime due to 5% average rate increases, partially offset by rate decreases in daytime and news dayparts. CBS Network had additional units available for sale in 2002 versus the prior year when there were fewer units available as a result of the events of September 11, during which CBS ran sustained news coverage from September 11 through September 14, 2001. CBS Network sold approximately 85% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2002/2003 season versus 65% of its inventory in the upfront for the 2001/2002 season. The revenue increases were partially offset by the absence of the Super Bowl, which CBS televised in 2001. The Stations group delivered 12% year over year advertising revenue growth led by increased political ads and higher sales in the automotive and services industries. The acquisition of KCAL TV Los Angeles in May 2002 contributed 5% of the Stations group revenue growth for the year. For 2002, Television revenues also reflected a decrease in domestic and foreign syndication revenues and lower network revenues, partially offset by higher home entertainment revenues. Domestic syndication revenues included revenues from the initial availability to cable of 7TH HEAVEN, CHARMED, SISTER, SISTER, and ANY DAY NOW as well as higher library revenues from THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW and HAPPY DAYS. However, these revenues did not match the absence of contributions from the syndication of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION and CHEERS in the prior year and license fees from cancelled series including STAR TREK: VOYAGER, DR. LAURA and REAL TV. Foreign syndication revenues were lower primarily resulting from lower current series revenues partially offset by higher revenues from library product. Network revenues decreased as revenues from new series in the 2002/2003 season were more than offset by the absence of revenues from canceled series. Home entertainment revenues were higher primarily from the DVD release of seasons one through seven of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION. For 2002, Television operating income increased to $1.2 billion from $385.8 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The increase also reflected the impact of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 in connection with the plan to integrate UPN with CBS operations. Production and programming expenses at the broadcast networks increased 1.5%, principally reflecting higher costs in primetime due to contractual series increases and higher sports rights offset by lower NFL costs due to the absence of the Super Bowl in 2002. The Stations group incurred higher costs for syndicated programming and sports rights. Total operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, improved by one percentage point over the prior year. II 13 Radio (Radio Stations) (Contributed 8% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 2,097.6 $ 2,121.6 $ 2,014.8 Operating income (OI) $ 975.0 $ 1,007.6 $ 382.4 OI as a % of revenues 46% 47% 19% Depreciation and amortization $ 27.4 $ 30.8 $ 608.0 Capital expenditures $ 14.1 $ 14.4 $ 12.4 2003 vs. 2002 Radio revenues are generated from 185 domestic radio stations. For 2003, Radio revenues of $2.1 billion reflected a 1% increase in advertising revenues primarily from national sales. The advertising revenue growth was more than offset by lower ancillary revenues principally related to management services provided to Westwood One, an affiliated company. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. For 2003, Radio operating income decreased 3% principally due to the revenue decrease and an increase in expenses. Operating expenses, primarily comprised of radio programming expenses including on air talent, program rights amortization and other production costs, increased 7% for the year primarily reflecting contractual talent increases as well as increased sports rights. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3%, reflecting $13 million of insurance recoveries and lower advertising and promotional expenditures for the year. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased one percentage point. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Radio revenues increased 5% to $2.1 billion. Advertising revenues increased 5% driven by an increase in spots sold for the year, with average spot rates increasing slightly. Radio also experienced an increase in ancillary revenues principally related to management services provided to Westwood One. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $94.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Radio operating income increased to $1.0 billion from $382 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, offset by incremental expenses associated with acquired sports rights. Outdoor (Outdoor Advertising Properties) (Contributed 7% of consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 1,748.3 $ 1,633.5 $ 1,656.6 Operating income (loss) (OI) $ 207.9 $ 218.0 $ (90.6 ) OI as a % of revenues 12% 13% NM Depreciation and amortization $ 215.9 $ 205.6 $ 617.9 Capital expenditures $ 58.1 $ 67.1 $ 86.9 NM Not meaningful II 14 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Outdoor revenues increased 7% to $1.7 billion reflecting a 17% increase from its European properties and a 2% increase in North America. Revenue growth from its European properties was principally driven by favorable foreign exchange rates. North American results reflected higher revenues from U.S. billboards, driven by an increase in the number of displays, partially offset by lower revenues from the U.S. transit business, due to a decrease in the number of displays and in the average per unit rate, and lower revenues from billboards in Mexico. Approximately 43% of Outdoor revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe, in 2003 compared with 41% in 2002. For 2003, Outdoor operating income decreased 5% to $207.9 million as the revenue increase was more than offset by a 9% increase in total expenses principally due to higher billboard lease costs and sales related expenses as well as in transit guarantees and posting rotation expenses due to shorter campaigns. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased one percentage point for the year. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Outdoor revenues decreased 1% to $1.6 billion due to weakness in the outdoor advertising market during the first half of 2002. The decline in revenues reflected a 5% decrease in domestic revenues, partially offset by a 4% increase in revenues from its European properties. Approximately 41% and 40% of Outdoors revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe, for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Outdoor operating income for 2002 increased to $218.0 million from an operating loss of $90.6 million, as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Operating income also reflected higher guarantee payments on transit contracts in 2002 versus 2001. Entertainment (Production and distribution of Motion Pictures; Consumer Publishing as well as the operation of Theme Parks, Movie Theaters and Music Publishing) (Contributed 15% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and 16% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 4,101.3 $ 3,680.1 $ 3,626.8 Operating income (OI) $ 271.4 $ 358.3 $ 215.3 OI as a % of revenues 7% 10% 6% Depreciation and amortization $ 129.7 $ 120.7 $ 182.8 Capital expenditures $ 66.4 $ 74.6 $ 54.9 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Entertainment revenues increased 11% to $4.1 billion principally reflecting higher Features, Theaters and Consumer Publishing revenues. Approximately 37% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were higher principally due to increased worldwide home entertainment, theatrical and pay television revenues, partially offset by lower network revenues. Worldwide home entertainment revenues included contributions from THE ADVENTURES OF INDIANA JONES THE COMPLETE DVD MOVIE COLLECTION, HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS, THE ITALIAN JOB and LARA CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE. Domestic theatrical revenues were lower than the prior year due in part to fewer titles in domestic theatrical release. Foreign theatrical revenues were higher than the prior year primarily due to contributions from HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS, LARA II 15 CROFT TOMB RAIDER: THE CRADLE OF LIFE and THE ITALIAN JOB. Pay television revenues were higher while network revenues were lower compared to the prior year, both reflecting a change in the mix of titles available. Theaters revenues increased 12% principally due to the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation, higher average admission prices and increased per capita spending, which more than offset a decline in attendance. Parks revenues increased slightly for the year primarily due to a 1% increase in average per capita spending and the benefit of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 2% decline in attendance. Publishing revenues increased 3% on the strength of its top selling titles for the year which included "THE ULTIMATE WEIGHT SOLUTION" by Dr. Phil McGraw, "LIVING HISTORY" by Hillary Rodham Clinton and "THE DARK TOWER V (WOLVES OF THE CALLA)" by Stephen King. For 2003, Entertainment operating income decreased 24% to $271.4 million, as the revenue increases noted above were more than offset by increased Features distribution and film amortization costs. Total expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased three percentage points. License fees for television exhibition of completed motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were approximately $1.2 and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including intercompany revenues of $281.1 million and $303.7 million. 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $3.7 billion principally reflecting higher Publishing, Theaters and Features revenues, partially offset by lower Parks revenues. Approximately 33% of Entertainments revenues were generated from international regions, principally Europe and Canada. Features revenues were slightly higher principally due to higher network television, domestic home video, domestic syndication and pay television revenues, which were partially offset by lower worldwide theatrical, foreign syndication, foreign pay television and foreign home video revenues. Domestic theatrical revenues primarily included contributions from the theatrical release of THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, WE WERE SOLDIERS, JACKASS THE MOVIE, CHANGING LANES and STAR TREK NEMESIS. Worldwide home video revenues were higher than last years revenues including contributions from VANILLA SKY, JIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS, THE SUM OF ALL FEARS and WE WERE SOLDIERS. Worldwide home video revenues included increases from the growth in demand for current releases and library titles in the DVD format and an overall decline in the demand for the VHS format. Theaters revenues increased 7% due to higher average admission prices, higher attendance and increased per capita concession spending. Attendance in 2002 increased 3% compared with the prior year. Average admission prices and per capita concession spending both increased 5% over the prior year. Publishing revenues increased 4% primarily due to income from new distribution agreements and higher sales in the Adult Group and Childrens Book and Audio Divisions. The top selling titles for 2002 included "FROM A BUICK 8" by Stephen King, "SELF MATTERS" by Dr. Phil McGraw and "EVERYTHINGS EVENTUAL" also by Stephen King. II 16  For 2002, Entertainment operating income increased 66% to $358.3 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Operating income benefited from the revenue increases noted above and from lower development and overhead costs at Features and lower depreciation expense at Theaters. Video (Home videocassette, DVD and video game rental and retail operations) (Contributed 22% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, 23% for the year ended December 31, 2002 and 22% for the year ended December 31, 2001.) Year Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 5,911.7 $ 5,565.9 $ 5,156.7 Operating income (OI) $ (847.8 ) $ 355.8 $ (219.6 ) OI as a % of revenues NM 6% NM Depreciation and amortization $ 257.9 $ 233.8 $ 423.7 Capital expenditures $ 176.8 $ 140.6 $ 93.1 NM Not meaningful 2003 vs. 2002 For 2003, Video revenues increased 6% to $5.9 billion as a result of growth in rental and retail revenues. International revenues accounted for 26% of total revenues with 62% from Europe and 20% from Canada. The following is a summary of revenues by category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Rental $ 4,533.5 77 % $ 4,460.4 80 % $ 4,314.7 84 % Retail 1,281.6 22 1,019.7 18 735.2 14 Other 96.6 1 85.8 2 106.8 2 Total revenues $ 5,911.7 100 % $ 5,565.9 100 % $ 5,156.7 100 % The increase in revenues was primarily due to a net increase of 198 company operated stores, favorable exchange rates and the fourth quarter of 2002 acquisitions of GameStation, Inc., a leading games retailer in the United Kingdom, and the remaining interest in joint venture stores in Italy. Worldwide same store revenues decreased 2.2% as a result of a 3.6% decrease in worldwide same store rental revenues, partially offset by a 3.7% increase in worldwide same store retail revenues. The decline in worldwide same store rental revenues was primarily the result of a weaker market worldwide. While the rental market slowed during 2003, retail demand for DVDs and games continued to increase and Blockbuster capitalized on this growth during the first half of 2003. The growth in same store retail revenues slowed during the second half of 2003 as Blockbuster competed against strong same store sales growth in the prior year. During the third and fourth quarters of 2002, Blockbuster implemented several promotions to increase demand for retail product. These initiatives were reduced in 2003 in order to focus on improving profitability. II 17 Rental Revenues For 2003, rental revenues increased 1.6% to $4.5 billion due primarily to increases in movie rental revenues, offset slightly by decreased game rental revenues. The following is a summary of rental revenues by product category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Movie rental: VHS $ 1,435.7 32 % $ 2,190.1 49 % $ 3,057.8 71 % DVD 2,599.7 57 1,741.0 39 799.1 18 Total movie rental 4,035.4 89 3,931.1 88 3,856.9 89 Game rental 498.1 11 529.3 12 457.8 11 Total rental revenues $ 4,533.5 100 % $ 4,460.4 100 % $ 4,314.7 100 % The increase in rental revenues was primarily due to a net increase of 198 company operated stores, favorable exchange rates and the fourth quarter of 2002 acquisition of the remaining interest in joint venture stores in Italy, partially offset by a 3.6% decrease in worldwide same store rental revenues, driven by decreases in both movies and games. The decrease in same store rental revenues was the result of a generally weaker rental market and increased competition from retail DVD sales as compared to prior year. Domestic operations represented 78.6% of rental revenues in 2003 as compared with 81.8% in 2002. Blockbusters rental revenues are generated from the rental of VHS tapes, DVDs, video games and from any eventual sale of previously rented VHS tapes, DVDs and video games. Revenues generated from rental transactions include revenues received in connection with the initial rental of product, as well as revenues related to any continuations of such rentals past the initial rental period, as contemplated by Blockbusters membership agreement. Blockbuster believes the decline in same store rental revenues was in line with the overall industry, reflecting a softening in the movie rental industry during the fourth quarter of 2003 and increased competition from retail DVD sales. Based upon Blockbusters belief that the size of the video rental market has contracted as a result of the competition from DVD sell through, simultaneous availability of rental and retail product and availability of other home video distribution channels, they expect the market to continue to decline slightly in the coming year. Retail Revenues For 2003, retail revenues increased 26% to $1.3 billion due to increases in both movie and game sales. The following is a summary of retail revenues by product category: Year Ended December 31, 2003 Percentage of Total 2002 Percentage of Total 2001 Percentage of Total Movie sales: VHS $ 65.2 5 % $ 128.8 13 % $ 167.9 23 % DVD 516.4 40 370.4 36 178.8 24 Total movie sales 581.6 45 499.2 49 346.7 47 Game sales 305.0 24 164.7 16 31.0 4 General retail 395.0 31 355.8 35 357.5 49 Total retail revenues $ 1,281.6 100 % $ 1,019.7 100 % $ 735.2 100 % Retail revenues continued to grow as a percentage of total revenues during 2003, representing 21.7% of total revenues in 2003, compared with 18.3% of total revenues in 2002. The increase in overall retail II 18 revenues was primarily the result of the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002 of GameStation, Inc., favorable exchange rates and an increase in company operated stores. In addition, worldwide same store retail revenues increased 3.7% driven by increases across all categories. Overall, retail revenue growth reflected an increase in units sold, both for movies and games, as well as an increase in the average unit price for movies due to a higher DVD mix, partially offset by a lower average unit price for games. In the fourth quarter of 2003, Blockbuster recorded a non cash charge of approximately $1.3 billion resulting from the application of SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 to reduce the carrying value of its goodwill and other long lived assets which resulted in an operating loss of $847.8 million for full year 2003. The impact of the charge more than offset the increase in gross profit that was driven by the overall growth in revenues and gross margin to 59.6% in 2003 from 57.6% in 2002, with both rental and retail gross margins improving year over year. Blockbuster ended 2003 with 8,867 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 198 company operated stores and 124 franchise stores over December 31, 2002. Viacom currently owns approximately 81.5% of Blockbuster (NYSE: BBI). 2002 vs. 2001 For 2002, Video revenues increased 8% to $5.6 billion from $5.2 billion principally driven by an increase of 5.1% in worldwide same store revenues and a net increase of 495 company operated stores from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002. Domestic revenues increased 7% while international revenues increased 13%. International revenues represented approximately 21% of Video revenues, with approximately 55% from Europe and 23% from Canada. Worldwide same store revenues, which includes rental and retail product, increased 5.1% primarily resulting from 32.6% growth in same store retail revenues, and 0.9% growth in same store rental revenues over the prior year. Domestic and international same store revenues increased 4.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Blockbuster ended 2002 with 8,545 worldwide company owned and franchise stores, a net increase of 495 company operated stores and 69 franchise stores over December 31, 2001. For 2002, Video operating income increased to $355.8 million from a loss of $219.6 million as goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized upon adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The improvement in operating income was also due to the charge reflected in 2001 results as described below. Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for lease obligations related to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in January 2003. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these lease guarantees. The Company has accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations and the $18.7 million had no impact on the Companys operating results for 2002. During the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster began implementation of a strategic re merchandising plan to allow for an expansion of store space for DVD and other strategic product offerings, which it completed by December 31, 2001. In connection with its plan, Blockbuster disposed of approximately 30% of its rental VHS library in its stores, certain VHS merchandise inventory primarily located in its distribution center and certain games from its rental library in its stores. The net book value of the eliminated inventory, net of proceeds, resulted in a primarily non cash charge of approximately $195.9 million to operating expenses in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Blockbuster also recorded a charge of approximately $26.9 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily related to employee, labor and supply and disposal costs to execute the plan. Additionally, $2.6 million was charged to depreciation expense for the write off of fixed assets and $1.9 million was charged below operating income to equity in loss of affiliated companies for the adoption of a similar re merchandising plan at one of Blockbusters joint venture operations. The plan was completed by the end of 2001 through the destruction or sale of the identified items. II 19 Also, during the third quarter of 2001, Blockbuster recorded approximately $27.6 million in selling, general and administrative expenses related to two lawsuits. The amounts described above, including $141.7 million recorded as the change in accounting estimates for rental inventory, represented the 2001 pre tax charge of approximately $396.6 million. Financial Position Current assets increased 8% to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2003 from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily due to an increase of $615.3 million in accounts receivable and an increase of $219.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by a decrease in other current assets of $133.4 million. The increase in accounts receivable was driven primarily by higher fourth quarter revenues from Entertainment as well as increased advertising and affiliate revenues at MTV Networks. Also contributing to this increase was the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central, as well as the timing of customer payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 6.4% at December 31, 2003 compared with 7.0% at December 31, 2002. This decrease reflected improved receivable aging at the end of 2003 and favorable customer settlements during the year. Net property and equipment decreased $120.7 million to $6.0 billion at December 31, 2003 from $6.1 billion at December 31, 2002 primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $896.8 million partially offset by capital expenditures of $534.4 million, foreign currency translation adjustments of $158.8 million and the addition of capital leases of $80.3 million. Goodwill of $57.1 billion decreased $59.5 million from December 31, 2002, reflecting the $1.3 billion non cash charge related to Blockbusters goodwill, partially offset by additional goodwill resulting from acquisitions, primarily the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central. Current liabilities increased $238.8 million to $7.6 billion primarily due to increases of $159.7 million in income taxes payable and $195.4 million in participants share, residuals and royalties payable, primarily for feature films. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $122.3 million, primarily relating to purchases made by Blockbuster at the end of 2002. Total debt, including current maturities, decreased $524.7 million to $9.9 billion at December 31, 2003 principally reflecting the use of cash from operations to reduce outstanding debt. Minority interest of $627.0 million at December 31, 2003 decreased $218.2 million from $845.2 million at December 31, 2002 reflecting the impact on minority owners of the write down of Blockbusters goodwill, as well as the purchases of Blockbuster Class A common stock in 2003 in order to maintain Viacoms consolidated tax position with Blockbuster. Cash Flows Operating Activities. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected net earnings of $1.4 billion adjusted for non cash charges of $1.3 billion and depreciation and amortization of $999.8 million. Additionally, operating cash flow reflected increases in participation liabilities and decreases in other assets offset by increases in receivables noted above and payments of accounts payable. The reduction in accounts payable was largely attributable to the purchases of merchandise inventory by Blockbuster at the end of 2002. Operating cash flow also benefited from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $77.1 million. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected net earnings of $725.7 million adjusted for non cash charges of $1.5 billion for the adoption of SFAS 142 and depreciation and amortization of $945.6 million. Additionally, operating cash flow benefited from the utilization of deferred tax assets of $655 million and from the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $210.3 million. These increases were partially offset by an additional investment in Blockbusters merchandise and rental inventory and increased program rights for television series and sports. Net cash flow from operating activities of $3.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected a net loss of $223.5 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of II 20 $3.1 billion, and for the 2001 Blockbuster, MTVN and UPN charges plus decreases in accounts receivable, partially offset by payments of accrued expenses and accounts payable. Cash paid for income taxes of $933.9 million for 2003 was higher than 2002 payments of $630.1 million principally due to higher operating income (excluding the non cash impairment charge) as well as the absence of 2002 non recurring items. The Company anticipates that higher operating income and the absence of non recurring tax attributes in 2004 will result in an increase in cash payments for taxes of approximately $500 million to $700 million over 2003 levels. While the Company does not have direct access to Blockbusters cash flow, should the Company complete the divestiture of Blockbuster in 2004, the Companys operating cash flow would decrease by the amount of their cash flow. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Blockbusters operating cash flow was approximately 17% of the Companys consolidated cash flow. Investing Activities. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected acquisitions of $1.3 billion, capital expenditures of $534.4 million principally for video stores, broadcasting equipment and outdoor advertising structures and additional investments of $40.0 million in affiliated companies. Acquisitions primarily consisted of the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central, as well as Outdoors acquisition of a billboard operator in Puerto Rico and the purchase of $62.3 million of Blockbuster Class A stock by the Company in order to maintain its ownership interest of at least 80% for tax consolidation purposes. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets totaling $47.3 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected capital expenditures of $537.1 million, additional investments of $60.8 million in affiliated companies and acquisitions of $926.0 million primarily reflecting the acquisition of KCAL TV and the remaining interest in Noggin that the Company did not already own. Activity in 2002 also reflected Blockbusters acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in an Italy joint venture and the acquisition of a games retailer in the United Kingdom. During 2002, the Company acquired shares of Blockbusters Class A common stock for $11.2 million. These expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of certain investments and fixed assets totaling $72.2 million. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 principally reflected the acquisitions of BET and outdoor businesses and capital expenditures of $515.4 million partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of radio stations and other assets. Capital expenditures for 2004 are anticipated to be approximately $700 million. The increase over 2003 levels is primarily to support Blockbusters various revenue and profitability growth initiatives, as well as systems and infrastructure improvements. The Company spent $534.4 million during 2003. Capital expenditures are funded with cash flows from operations. Financing Activities. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected the purchase of Company stock for $945.1 million, repayment of notes and debentures of $771.2 million and the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $472.1 million, including payments of financing costs. In addition, the Company paid $104.6 million in dividends to stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2003. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $736.5 million, net of financing costs, and from the exercise of employee stock options of $263.3 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $1.0 billion, the net repayment of bank debt, including commercial paper, of $1.2 billion, and the purchase of Company stock for $1.1 billion. These uses were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.3 billion and from the exercise of employee stock options of $357.6 million. Net cash flow used for financing activities of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflected the net repayment of debt for $1.6 billion and the purchase of Company stock for $1.1 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $184.6 million. II 21 In 2004, the declarations of a $.06 per share quarterly dividend would result in an annual payment to Viacoms stockholders of approximately $420 million. On January 28, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors declared a $.06 per share quarterly dividend payable April 1, 2004 to Viacoms stockholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2004. Stock Purchase Program During 2003, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 23.6 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $981.4 million under its stock purchase programs, of which $545.3 million was spent in the fourth quarter for 13.3 million shares. As of December 31, 2003 there was approximately $1.9 billion remaining under the current $3.0 billion purchase program. From January 1 through March 10, 2004, the Company purchased an additional 8.2 million shares for approximately $336.6 million. During 2002, on a trade date basis, the Company purchased approximately 27.8 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for approximately $1.2 billion under its stock purchase programs, of which $350.7 million was spent in the fourth quarter of 2002 for 8.1 million shares. Acquisitions On May 22, 2003, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central that it did not own for $1.2 billion in cash. Comedy Centrals results have been consolidated as part of Cable Networks, effective from the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired of approximately $1.1 billion was allocated to goodwill. The final allocation of the purchase price will be based on comprehensive final evaluations of the fair value of Comedy Centrals assets acquired and liabilities assumed. On May 15, 2002, the Company acquired the assets of KCAL TV Los Angeles for approximately $650 million. During 2002, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% interest in Noggin, the 24 hour digital network for kids that it did not already own for approximately $100 million. Blockbuster acquired the 51% interest that it did not already own in a joint venture in Italy and also acquired a games retailer in the United Kingdom for approximately $82.4 million in the aggregate in 2002. Capital Structure At December 31, 2003 2002 Notes payable to banks $ 107.2 $ 423.7 Commercial paper 20.0 174.6 Senior debt 9,474.7 9,530.7 Senior subordinated debt 66.3 56.1 Other notes 26.0 28.6 Obligations under capital leases 387.0 392.2 Total Debt 10,081.2 10,605.9 Less current portion 196.3 199.0 Less discontinued operations debt (a) 201.7 201.7 Total Long Term Debt $ 9,683.2 $ 10,205.2 (a)Included in "Other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. Total debt of $10.1 billion at December 31, 2003 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2002 was 13.8% and 14.5%, respectively, as a percentage of total capitalization of the Company. The senior debt of Viacom Inc. is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary Viacom International Inc. The senior debt and senior subordinated debt of the Companys wholly owned II 22 subsidiaries, CBS Broadcasting Inc. and Go Outdoor Systems Holdings S.A., respectively, are not guaranteed; the aggregate outstanding amount of such debt at December 31, 2003 was $118.5 million. The Companys total debt presented above includes, for the year ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, (i) an aggregate unamortized premium of $41.4 million and $49.5 million and (ii) the net change in the carrying value of the debt relating to fair value swaps of $48.2 million and $86.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the following debt issuances, maturities and redemptions occurred: Debt Issuances May 14, 2003, $300.0 million 4.625% senior notes due 2018 May 14, 2003, $450.0 million 5.50% senior debentures due 2033 August 28, 2002, $600.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2012 April 25, 2002, $700.0 million 5.625% senior notes due 2007 Interest on all of the above debt instruments is paid semi annually.

The Companys scheduled maturities of long term debt at face value, excluding commercial paper and capital leases, outstanding at December 31, 2003 were as follows: Year of Maturity 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and thereafter Long term debt $ 126.1 $ 1,472.8 $ 801.7 $ 700.2 $ .2 $ 6,483.6 II 23  Viacom Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2003, the Companys credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, totaled $4.65 billion comprised of a $1.7 billion 364 day revolving facility due February 2004, a $1.45 billion revolving facility due May 2005 and a $1.5 billion revolving facility due March 2006 (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). In February 2004, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion 5 year credit facility which replaced the $1.7 billion and $1.45 billion facilities. The terms and conditions of the $3.0 billion facility are substantially similar to the $1.5 billion facility. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the $3.0 billion and $1.5 billion facilities. Borrowing rates under the facilities are determined at the Companys option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Companys senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.41 billion in the aggregate. The facilities contain covenants, which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities. The primary purpose of the credit facilities is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2003, the Company had commercial paper borrowings of $20.0 million under its $4.65 billion commercial paper program. The Companys credit facilities supporting the commercial paper borrowings totaled $4.5 billion in February 2004. Borrowings under the program have maturities of less than a year. At December 31, 2003, the Company had classified approximately $21.6 million of commercial paper and other debt scheduled to mature within the next twelve months as long term debt, reflecting its intent and ability, through the existence of unused revolving credit facilities, to refinance this debt on a long term basis. Blockbuster Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2003, Blockbusters credit agreement (the "Blockbuster Credit Agreement") was comprised of a $600.0 million long term revolver due July 1, 2004 and a $100.0 million term loan due in quarterly installments ending July 1, 2004. Blockbuster had $600.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the long term revolver at December 31, 2003. Interest rates under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement are based on the prime rate in the United States or LIBOR (plus a margin, or "LIBOR spread," based on leverage ratios, which is currently 1.25%) at Blockbusters option at the time of borrowing. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2003 for borrowings under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement was 2.4%. A variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver (0.25% at December 31, 2003). The Blockbuster Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, relate to the payment of dividends, purchase of Blockbusters common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003, Blockbuster was in compliance with all covenants under the Blockbuster Credit Agreement. Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company had an aggregate of $1.0 billion and $981.9 million, respectively, outstanding under revolving receivable securitization programs. The programs result in the sale of receivables on a non recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable and debt on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Company enters into these arrangements because they provide an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from the programs were used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The terms of the revolving securitization II 24 arrangements require that the receivable pools subject to the programs meet certain performance ratios. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization programs. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes that its operating cash flow ($3.5 billion in 2003), cash and cash equivalents ($850.7 million at December 31, 2003), borrowing capacity under committed bank facilities (which consisted of unused revolving credit facilities, excluding Blockbusters credit facility, of $4.41 billion in the aggregate at December 31, 2003), and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, including commitments and contingencies, capital and investing commitments and its financing requirements for the foreseeable future. The funding for commitments to purchase sports programming rights, television and film operations, and talent contracts will come primarily from cash flow from operations. The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include capital expenditures, share purchases, acquisitions, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activity available to meet these needs. Any net cash funding requirements are financed with short term borrowings (primarily commercial paper) and long term debt. Commercial paper borrowings, which also accommodate day to day changes in funding requirements, are backed by committed bank facilities that may be utilized in the event that commercial paper borrowings are not available. The Companys strong credit position, which is reflected by an A /A3 rating, affords access to the capital markets. The Company anticipates that scheduled debt maturities in 2004 will be funded with cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operating activities. There are no provisions in any of the Companys material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in the Companys debt ratings. The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock and warrants of Viacom that may be issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 billion. The registration statement was first declared effective on January 8, 2001. The net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by Viacom for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital and capital expenditures, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. To date, the Company has issued $2.385 billion of securities under the shelf registration statement. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company had a total of $759.8 million of long term debt maturities, redemptions and repurchases and issued $750 million of long term debt. The long term debt issuances maintained the Companys unused borrowing capacity and its financial flexibility. II 25 As of December 31, 2003, the Companys significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and thereafter Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 13,199.2 $ 3,555.8 $ 3,972.2 $ 2,152.2 $ 3,519.0 Operating leases (2) 5,436.8 972.0 1,546.1 1,016.9 1,901.8 Guaranteed minimum franchise payments (3) 1,453.5 424.5 620.3 204.7 204.0 Purchase obligations (4) 1,155.9 758.9 238.2 79.7 79.1 Capital lease obligations (including interest) (5) 508.6 102.2 161.7 116.6 128.1 Long term debt obligations (6) 9,584.6 126.1 2,274.5 700.4 6,483.6 Other long term liabilities (7) 1,763.5 1,458.0 192.1 113.4 (1)Programming and talent commitments of the Company include $8.2 billion for the acquisition of sports programming rights, $3.2 billion relating to television, radio and feature film production and acquisitions and $1.1 billion for talent contracts. (2)Includes long term noncancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3)Viacoms outdoor advertising business has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks and stadium signage. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchiser is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. (4)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (5)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders and buildings. (6)Long term debt obligations are presented at face value. (7)Long term contractual obligations, including program liabilities and participations due to producers and residuals. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet arrangements primarily consist of the guarantees described below. Guarantees The Company owns a 50% equity interest in United Cinemas International ("UCI"), which operates movie theaters in Europe, Latin America and Asia. As of December 31, 2003, the Company guaranteed approximately $291.9 million of UCIs debt obligations under a revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2004, and $175.6 million of UCIs theater leases. The Company also owns a 50% interest in WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. and Graumans Theatres LLC and guarantees certain theater leases for approximately $13.2 million. The debt and lease guarantees would only be triggered upon non payment by the respective primary obligors. These guarantees are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. Additionally, the Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $348.0 million at December 31, 2003 and are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. The Company is also subject to certain off balance sheet lease guarantees related to the divestitures of certain businesses. In October 1998, Blockbuster Music stores were sold to Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. ("Wherehouse"). Some of the leases transferred in connection with this sale had previously been guaranteed either by the Company or its affiliates. The remaining initial terms of these leases expire on various dates through 2007. However, certain leases contain renewal options that can II 26 extend the primary lease term and remain subject to the guarantee. Blockbuster had previously agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to any amount paid under these guarantees. On January 21, 2003, Wherehouse filed a petition for protection under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law. Based on information regarding lease and guaranty expirations originally available to Blockbuster in connection with the Wherehouse bankruptcy, Blockbusters estimated a contingent liability of approximately $36.0 million. Of this amount Blockbuster recorded a reserve of $18.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 which represented its estimate of the lease guarantee obligation at that time. During 2003, Blockbuster paid approximately $8.2 million associated with the lease guarantee obligation. As of December 31, 2003, Blockbuster estimated its contingent liability for Wherehouse leases to be approximately $12.6 million. Of this amount Blockbuster determined its reserve to be $7.9 million and as a result Blockbuster reduced its original reserve by $2.6 million. The Company had previously accounted for these reserves in discontinued operations. Legal Matters Asbestos and Environmental. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims typically are both filed and settled in large groups, which makes the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had pending approximately 112,280 asbestos claims, as compared to approximately 103,800 as of December 31, 2002 and approximately 106,000 as of December 31, 2001. The 2002 and 2001 numbers of claims included approximately 1,100 claims and 7,100 claims, respectively, on inactive dockets in various states which would not be counted as pending under the Companys current methodology. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2003, approximately 82,340 were pending in state courts, 27,400 in federal court and approximately 2,540 were third party claims. During 2003, the Company received approximately 36,990 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 28,500 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. To date, the Company has not been liable for any third party claims. The Companys total costs (recovery) in 2003 and 2002 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $(8.7) million and $28 million, respectively. A portion of such costs relates to claims settled in prior years. If proceeds received in 2003 from commuted insurance policies were excluded from the Companys total costs in 2003, the Companys total costs after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits would have been $56.6 million. Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos, lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure, other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease. Claims identified as cancer remain a small percentage of asbestos claims II 27 pending at December 31, 2003. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities and that these asbestos liabilities are not likely to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to discontinued operations conducted by companies acquired by the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. Antitrust. In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of the Company, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries with respect to a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint included federal antitrust and California state law claims. In August 2003, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the federal court judgment. The Supreme Court of the United States refused plaintiffs petition for writ of certiorari in March 2004. In February 2003, a similar complaint that had been filed in a Los Angeles County Superior Court was also dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiffs have appealed the California state court dismissal, as well as a prior denial of class certification. The Company believes that the plaintiffs positions in these litigations are without merit and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in the litigations. Blockbuster Securities Actions. During February and March 2003, putative class action complaints were filed against Blockbuster in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. A director and certain officers of Blockbuster were also named as defendants. The remaining putative class actions have been consolidated into one action styled In re Blockbuster Inc. Securities Litigation, which is pending in the same court. The consolidated amended complaint, filed July 2003, claims violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the time period approximately between February and December 2002. It also generally alleges that the defendants made untrue statements of material fact and or omitted to disclose material facts about Blockbusters business and operations, that the value of Blockbusters common stock was therefore artificially inflated and that certain of the individual defendants sold shares of Blockbusters common stock at inflated prices. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. In addition, three shareholder derivative actions were filed in February, March and April 2003, of which one is pending in federal court in Texas and two have been consolidated into one action in Texas state court, each arising from substantially similar operative facts. These shareholder derivative actions include claims for breach of fiduciary duties for various time periods beginning in February 2002 and name certain Blockbuster officers and directors, some of whom are directors and or executive officers of the Company, as individual defendants, and Blockbuster as a nominal defendant. The Company and Blockbuster believe the plaintiffs positions in all of these actions are without merit and Blockbuster intends to vigorously defend these matters. Other. In December 2002, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California claiming that Blockbuster had breached the revenue sharing agreement between the two parties. Buena Vista claims damages in excess of $120 million. Blockbuster has answered and asserted counterclaims for reformation and breach of contract. On July 22, 2003, the California federal court granted Buena Vistas motion for partial summary judgment, stating in its ruling that a liquidated damages provision in the contract is enforceable. The court reaffirmed its ruling when it denied Blockbusters motion for reconsideration in February 2004. Blockbuster has several remaining defenses to the claims asserted by Buena Vista. Blockbuster and the Company believe the plaintiffs position is without merit, and intend to vigorously defend this matter. II 28 Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that all of the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business with companies in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the non designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of "Other items, net". The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2003, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $296.9 million, of which $12.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $284.9 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. At December 31, 2002, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $266.0 million, of which $49.0 million related to the hedging of future productions costs. The remaining $217.0 million represented hedges of underlying foreign currency balances, expected foreign currency net cash flows and investment hedges. Interest Rate Risk The Companys interest expense is exposed to movements in short term rates. Swap agreements are used to modify this exposure. This includes both fixed to variable rate swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, and variable to fixed rate swaps, which are designed as cash flow hedges. Based on the amount of variable rate debt and receivable securitization programs outstanding at December 31, 2003, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause a $23.8 million change to pre tax earnings. As of December 31, 2003 if all parties were to agree, the swaps could have been terminated by a net payment from the counterparties of approximately $47.6 million. The Company has entered into cash flow swap agreements which effectively converted variable rate interest payments on commercial paper to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2003, the notional amount outstanding relating to these agreements was approximately $19.4 million and the swap agreements mature in September 2004. Interest is received based upon three month LIBOR and is paid at approximately 5.07%. The amount of the ineffectiveness of these cash flow hedges that was reflected in earnings was immaterial. The effective portion of the change in value of cash flow hedges is reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During the next twelve months, approximately $.5 million will be amortized into earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedges included in earnings was not material. The change in value of the fair value hedges and the hedged instruments is reported in earnings for the periods presented. II 29 On May 14, 2003, the Company entered into additional $300 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2018 and the Company receives interest at approximately 4.55% and pays three month LIBOR. On April 25, 2002, the Company entered into additional $700 million notional swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. The swaps mature on May 1, 2007 and the Company receives interest at approximately 5.11% on $400 million and 5.35% on $300 million, and pays three month LIBOR. During December 2001, the Company entered into $750 million notional amount of swap agreements, which converted fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations. Of the $750 million notional amount, $225 million received interest at approximately 3.2% and was to mature on January 15, 2003 and $275 million received interest at approximately 3.8% and was to mature on September 1, 2003. These swaps were terminated in November 2002 resulting in the Company receiving $8.7 million in cash which was amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the respective debt. These fair value hedges were fully effective. The remaining $250 million in notional amount matures on June 1, 2005 and receives interest at approximately 4.5%. These fair value hedges are fully effective. All the swaps paid or pay interest based on three month LIBOR. Credit Risk The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. The Companys receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2003 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Companys products and services are sold.

("NAI") is a closely held corporation that beneficially owns the Companys Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 71% of the voting power of all classes of the Companys Common Stock, and approximately 11% of the Companys Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis at December 31, 2003. Owners of the Companys Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share. The Companys Class B Common Stock does not have voting rights. NAI is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios including Paramount Pictures, a division of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, NAI made payments to Paramount Pictures in the aggregate amounts of approximately $9.6 million, $12.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. NAI and Mr. Redstone owned in the aggregate approximately 30% of the common stock of Midway Games Inc. ("Midway") as of December 31, 2003. Midway sells home video games to Blockbuster and also places advertisements on various of the Companys cable networks from time to time. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, transactions with Midway totaled approximately $9.9 million, $12.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively. The Company owns a minority equity interest in Westwood One, Inc. ("Westwood One"). Most of Infinitys radio stations are affiliated with Westwood One, and Westwood One distributes nationally certain of the Companys radio programming. In connection with these arrangements, the Company receives affiliation fees as well as programming cost reimbursements and in certain instances, shares in revenue II 30 from the sale by Westwood One of Infinitys programming. In addition, certain employees of Infinity serve as officers of Westwood One for which the Company receives a management fee. CBS Television and Cable Networks also enter into programming agreements with Westwood One. Revenues from these arrangements were approximately $85.5 million, $127.7 million and $104.1 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Recent Pronouncements In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 150 "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"). SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The adoption of SFAS 150 as of July 1, 2003 did not have any effect on the Companys financial position. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51" which was replaced in December 2003 by the issuance of FIN 46R ("FIN 46R"). FIN 46R explains how to identify variable interest entities ("VIEs") and how a company should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. FIN 46R requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. The provisions of FIN 46R are effective for special purpose entities (SPEs) as of December 31, 2003. The Company has completed its review of its special purpose entities under FIN 46R and has determined that the application of FIN 46R did not impact the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows. The provisions of FIN 46R must be applied to VIEs as of March 31, 2004. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of the remaining provisions of FIN 46R will have on the Company. Critical Accounting Policies Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates. Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with SOP 00 2, which requires managements judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation and residual cost and any necessary net realizable value adjustments. The cost of Blockbusters rental library, which includes videocassettes, DVDs and games, is amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 12 months to an estimated residual value of $2 to $5 per II 31 unit, according to the product category. The estimates for useful lives and residual values of the rental library are continually evaluated based on changes in consumer demand. Changes in demand or buying patterns may impact the carrying value of the rental library and rental margins. During 2001, Blockbuster changed the estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for videocassettes and game products, which resulted in inventory write downs and increased amortization expense. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142 and a non cash charge would be required. Balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to taxes, legal issues, restructuring charges and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments and estimates by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to discontinued businesses, including environmental and asbestos are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled. The Company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. For 2003, the unrecognized actuarial loss for pension plans decreased as a result of plan assets producing a return higher than the expected return due to the market conditions in 2003 partially offset by lowering the discount rate for the Companys major plans from 6.5% in 2002 to 6.0% in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the total accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of the corresponding plan assets and therefore, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability of $773.8 million. As of December 31, 2002, such pension liability was $865.0 million. Risk Factors The risk factors listed below, in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report, could affect the business and future results of the Company. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its over the air networks, basic cable networks, television stations, radio stations and outdoor businesses. The sale of advertising is affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions for advertising. Adverse changes to any of these factors, including as a result of acts of terrorism or war, could have a negative effect on revenues. II 32 The Companys basic cable networks and premium subscription television networks are dependent upon affiliation agreements with cable and direct to home satellite services ("DTH") distributors on acceptable terms. The loss of carriage on such distributors, or continued carriage on less favorable terms, could adversely affect, with respect to basic cable networks, revenues from subscriber fees and the ability to sell advertising and, with respect to premium subscription television networks, subscriber fee revenues. In addition, continued consolidation among cable and or DTH distributors and vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business, could have an adverse effect on subscriber fees and advertising revenues, as the Companys ability to launch new networks or maintain or obtain additional distribution for existing networks is impacted by these factors. Operating results derived from the Companys motion picture and television production businesses fluctuate depending primarily upon cost of such productions and acceptance of such productions by the public, which are difficult to predict. Motion picture and television production has experienced cycles in which increased costs of talent, reduced availability of co financing opportunities, and other factors have resulted in higher production costs. In addition, the commercial success of the Companys motion picture and television productions depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing productions, and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill under SFAS 142 and a non cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a significant effect on the Companys reported net earnings. The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized pursuing the divestiture of Viacoms approximately 81.5% interest in Blockbuster, and the Company, while continuing to consider other alternatives, anticipates that the divestiture would be achieved through a tax free split off. The Company may determine, for market or other reasons, not to effectuate the divestiture of Blockbuster, or a split off of Blockbuster, if it does occur, may be taxable. In addition, should the Company complete a divestiture of Blockbuster, if the fair value of Blockbuster at the date of divestiture were below book value, a loss would be recognized. Such a loss could have a significant effect on the Companys reported net earnings. While the Company seeks to ensure compliance with FCC indecency laws and regulations, the definition of "indecency" is subject to interpretation and there can be no assurance that employees of the Company will not make decisions resulting in the broadcast of programming that does not meet such standards. Such programming could subject the Company to regulatory review or investigation, fines, adverse publicity or other sanctions including the loss of station licenses. Technology developments, including digital copying and file compression, and the growing penetration of high bandwidth Internet connections, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material. The Company takes actions to vigorously enforce its rights and protect its copyrighted materials and products, however there can be no assurance that it will be successful in preventing the distribution of pirated content. Increased piracy of the Companys copyrighted materials could negatively affect its operations and financial results. Advances in technologies such as personal video recorders and video on demand and changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these or other technologies could have an adverse effect on the Companys businesses, particularly its television and video businesses. II 33 The Company has contingent liabilities related to discontinued businesses, including environmental liabilities, liabilities related to illnesses of former employees and other pending and threatened litigation. While the pending or threatened litigations and environmental and other liabilities should not have a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance in this regard. The Companys home video retail business currently enjoys a competitive advantage over most other movie distribution channels, except theatrical releases, due to the early timing of the video retailer "distribution window." The video business could be negatively affected if the video retail distribution windows were no longer the first following the theatrical release; the length of the video retail distribution window were shortened; or the video retail distribution windows were no longer as exclusive as they are now. The Company believes that the studios have a significant interest in maintaining a viable video retail industry; however, the order, length and exclusivity of each window for each distribution channel is determined solely by the studio releasing the movie and the Company cannot predict the impact, if any, of any future decisions by the studios. Increased studio licensing of product to video on demand and similar services might impact their decisions with respect to the timing and exclusivity of the video retailer distribution window with possible adverse effect on the Video business. The Company cannot control or predict with certainty studio pricing policies for DVD and VHS product. Current studio policies reducing the pricing of movies released to DVDs and an increasing percentage of VHS titles allow for an affordable sales price by the retailer to the consumer from the beginning of the home video distribution window. This lower "sell through" pricing has led to increased competition from other retailers, including mass merchants and online retailers who are able to purchase DVDs for sale to consumers at the same time as traditional video retailers purchase both DVDs and videocassettes for rental. If sell through pricing, increased competition and consumer interest in building personal DVD libraries cause consumers to increasingly desire to purchase rather than rent movies, the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to increase rental market share, to replace profits from rentals with profits from sales of sell through product, or to otherwise positively affect gross profits. In addition, if studios make future changes in their pricing policies, which could include pricing rental windows for DVDs or expanded exploitation by studios of any international copyright laws that allow studios to charge retailers more for DVD and VHS rental product than for sell through product, the profitability of the video business could be negatively affected if it is unable to enter into arrangements with the studios that effectively balance copy depth and cost considerations. The Companys operating results fluctuate due to the timing and availability of theatrical and home video releases, as well as the recording of license fees for television exhibition of motion pictures and for syndication and basic cable exhibition of television programming in the period that the products are available for such exhibition. NAI, through its ownership of the Companys Class A common stock, has voting control of the Company. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require shareholder approval, including the election of directors, issuance of securities and transactions involving a change of control. During 2003, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with each of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer which addresses the specific responsibilities of each position. There can be no assurance that either of these executives will remain with the Company for the full term of his employment agreement. A departure of either of these executives, or of other key executives of the Company, could have an adverse effect on the Company. In the operation of its businesses, the Company engages the services of writers, directors, actors and others, which are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages and or higher costs in connection with these agreements could adversely impact the Companys operations. II 34 Changes in laws and regulations, including in particular FCC ownership and indecency rules, could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the operations and ownership of the Companys properties. Some of the Companys businesses are seasonal. The home video rental and retail business and the consumer publishing business are subject to increased periods of demand coinciding with summer and winter holidays, while a substantial majority of the theme parks operating income is generated from May through September. In addition, the home video and theme parks businesses revenues are influenced by weather. The Companys radio and outdoor advertising businesses experience fluctuations based on the timing of advertising expenditures by retailers. These risk factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the Company. Other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors also could have material adverse effects on the Companys future results.
