Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Managements discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS Corp.") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Please see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements. Overview In 2011, CBS Corporations results benefited from the continued popularity of its internally developed and acquired programming, new licensing agreements for digital streaming of television series, growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, and the new programming agreement for the NCAA Division I Mens Basketball Championship ("NCAA Tournament"). Beginning in 2011, pursuant to a 14 year agreement between the Company and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., the Company and Turner are sharing the rights to telecast the NCAA Tournament. For CBS Corp., this new agreement resulted in lower revenues, yet higher profits, for 2011 as compared to 2010. In addition, revenue comparisons for 2011 were negatively impacted by the 2010 broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network. Total revenues increased 1% for 2011, as decreases associated with these non comparable items as well as a decline in political advertising sales, were more than offset by 6% growth in content licensing and distribution revenues, a 9% increase in affiliate and subscription fee revenues and underlying growth in advertising sales. For 2011, operating income of $2.53 billion increased 39% from $1.82 billion for 2010 with growth in each of the Companys operating segments and an increase in the Companys total operating income margin of five percentage points to 18%. These increases were driven by the change in the revenue mix, lower sports and other acquired television programming costs, the benefit of cost containment and the timing of production and distribution expenses. Comparability of operating income was impacted by restructuring charges of $46 million and $81 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the favorable impact to 2010 from a settlement of $90 million for the resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses. Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") of $1.92 for 2011 increased $.88, or 85%, from $1.04 for 2010, primarily driven by the increase in operating income, lower interest expense due to a $1.40 billion reduction to the Companys outstanding debt during 2010, and lower weighted average shares outstanding, reflecting the impact of 2011 share repurchases. During 2011, the Company repurchased 42.2 million shares of its Class B Common Stock for $1.02 billion, at an average cost of $24.14 per share, and paid $206 million of cash dividends. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $5.98 billion of long term debt outstanding, which is comparable to December 31, 2010. For 2011, free cash flow of $1.48 billion, increased 2% from $1.45 billion for 2010. Comparability of free cash flow was impacted by pension contributions of $410 million in 2011 and $167 million in 2010, principally to pre fund the Companys qualified plans. The Company generated cash flow from operating activities of $1.75 billion for 2011 versus $1.74 billion for 2010. Free cash flow, a non GAAP financial measure, reflects the Companys net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program and less capital expenditures. See "Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Information" on pages II 11 and II 12 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), to free cash flow. II 4  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) CBS Corp. operates in the following five segments: ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, CBS Films and CBS Interactive. Entertainment revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate and subscription fees. The Entertainment segment contributed 52%, 53% and 54% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. Cable Networks revenues are generated primarily from affiliate fees, and the licensing and distribution of its content. The Cable Networks segment contributed 11% to consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 10% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schusters consumer book publishing business with imprints such as Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Free Press. Publishing generates revenues from the distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. Publishing contributed 6% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. LOCAL BROADCASTING: The Local Broadcasting segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales. The Local Broadcasting segment contributed 19%, 20% and 18% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. OUTDOOR: The Outdoor segment, through CBS Outdoor, displays advertising in North America, South America and Europe on media, including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Outdoor revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales. The Outdoor segment contributed 13% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Consolidated Results of Operations 2011 vs. 2010 and 2010 vs. 2009 Revenues The following tables present the Companys consolidated revenues by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Revenues by Type Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Increase/(Decrease) 2011 vs. 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) 2010 vs. 2009 Advertising $ 9,007 $ 9,153 $ (146 ) (2 )% $ 8,172 $ 981 12 % Content licensing and distribution 3,254 3,071 183 6 3,120 (49 ) (2 ) Affiliate and subscription fees 1,744 1,598 146 9 1,462 136 9 Other 240 238 2 1 261 (23 ) (9 ) Total Revenues $ 14,245 $ 14,060 $ 185 1 % $ 13,015 $ 1,045 8 % II 5 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Year Ended December 31, Percentage of Revenues by Type 2011 2010 2009 Advertising 63 % 65 % 63% Content licensing and distribution 23 22 24 Affiliate and subscription fees 12 11 11 Other 2 2 2 Total 100 % 100 % 100% Advertising sales decreased 2% to $9.01 billion in 2011 from $9.15 billion in 2010 as comparability for 2011 was impacted by the 2010 broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network and the new 14 year programming agreement between the Company and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. for the telecast of the NCAA Tournament, which began in 2011. In aggregate, these two non comparable items negatively impacted the advertising revenue comparison by four percentage points. Underlying advertising revenues for 2011 benefited from pricing increases for sports programming, growth in network primetime and higher outdoor advertising sales in the Americas, partially offset by significantly lower political spending as 2010 benefited from midterm elections. In 2010, advertising sales increased 12% to $9.15 billion from $8.17 billion in 2009, due in part to the recovery of an economic slow down and the continued popularity of the Companys content. The advertising growth also benefited from the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network and increased political advertising from the 2010 midterm elections. Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced programming to television, theaters and digital mediums, as well as for home entertainment sales; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. Content licensing and distribution revenues increased 6% to $3.25 billion in 2011 from $3.07 billion in 2010 reflecting growth in both domestic and international television license fees, principally driven by the impact of new licensing agreements for digital streaming. Revenue contributions from significant domestic syndication availabilities in 2011, which included the third cycle sale of Frasier, were lower than 2010, which included the second cycle sale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. In 2010, content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 2% to $3.07 billion in 2010 from $3.12 billion in 2009 principally reflecting lower contributions from significant domestic syndication availabilities, as 2010 included the second cycle syndication sale of only one title as compared to 2009 which included the first cycle availabilities of five titles. This decrease was partially offset by higher international syndication sales of television programming and the addition of theatrical revenues in 2010. Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite operators, telephone companies and other distributors for the carriage of the Companys cable networks, as well as for retransmission consent for the CBS Television Network and the Companys owned and operated television stations; fees received from non CBS owned television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and subscriber fees for online content. For 2011, affiliate and subscription fees increased 9% to $1.74 billion from $1.60 billion in 2010 and for 2010, affiliate and subscription fees increased 9% from $1.46 billion in 2009. These increases reflect growth in subscriptions and rate increases at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks, and higher retransmission revenues. Other revenues, which include ancillary fees for Entertainment, Cable Networks, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor operations, increased 1% to $240 million in 2011 from $238 million in 2010. For 2010, other II 6 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) revenues decreased 9% to $238 million in 2010 from $261 million in 2009, principally reflecting lower ancillary digital revenues. International Revenues The Company generated approximately 15% of its total revenues from international regions in both 2011 and 2010, and 14% in 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2011 % of International 2010 % of International 2009 % of International United Kingdom $ 489 22 % $ 459 22 % $ 431 23 % Other Europe 801 37 758 37 715 38 Canada 371 17 383 18 310 17 All other 529 24 476 23 405 22 Total International Revenues $ 2,190 100 % $ 2,076 100 % $ 1,861 100 % Operating Expenses The table below presents the Companys consolidated operating expenses by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Operating Expenses by Type Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Increase/(Decrease) 2011 vs. 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) 2010 vs. 2009 Programming $ 2,971 $ 3,510 $ (539 ) (15 )% $ 3,336 $ 174 5 % Production 1,939 2,061 (122 ) (6 ) 2,062 (1 ) Billboard, transit and other occupancy 1,035 1,029 6 1 1,020 9 1 Participation, distribution and royalty 814 693 121 17 597 96 16 Other 1,608 1,692 (84 ) (5 ) 1,685 7 Total Operating Expenses $ 8,367 $ 8,985 $ (618 ) (7 )% $ 8,700 $ 285 3 % Programming expenses represented 36% of total operating expenses in 2011, 39% in 2010 and 38% in 2009, and reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. Programming expenses decreased 15% to $2.97 billion in 2011 from $3.51 billion in 2010 primarily reflecting lower costs for sports programming, including the impact of the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament, which began in 2011, and the absence of the 2010 broadcast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network, as well as lower acquired television series costs. For 2010, programming expenses increased 5% to $3.51 billion in 2010 from $3.34 billion in 2009 reflecting higher sports programming costs, principally associated with the 2010 Super Bowl telecast and the NCAA Tournament on the CBS Television Network, partially offset by lower acquired television series costs. Production expenses represented 23% of total operating expenses in 2011 and 2010, and 24% in 2009, and reflect the direct costs of internally developed television and theatrical film content, as well as television and radio costs, including on air talent and other production costs. Production expenses decreased 6% to $1.94 billion in 2011 from $2.06 billion in 2010 principally driven by the title mix from licensing arrangements for television programming. For 2010, production expenses of $2.06 billion II 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) remained relatively flat compared to 2009 reflecting lower costs associated with lower domestic syndication sales, offset by increased investment in new television series and theatrical films. Billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses represented 12% of total operating expenses in 2011, 11% in 2010 and 12% in 2009, and reflect lease and franchise costs associated with billboards, transit and other outdoor displays, rent expense on production facilities, and other occupancy costs. Billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses increased 1% to $1.04 billion in 2011 from $1.03 billion in 2010 primarily driven by the effect of foreign exchange rate changes, partially offset by the settlement of legal matters in 2011 and lower costs from the mix of more profitable contracts. For 2010, billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses increased 1% to $1.03 billion in 2010 from $1.02 billion in 2009 primarily driven by franchise expense increases attributable to new Outdoor transit contracts, partially offset by decreases for lost contracts, lower billboard lease costs, as well as lower maintenance and display site costs and other cost reductions due to cost savings initiatives. Participation, distribution and royalty costs, which represented 10% of total operating expenses in 2011, 8% in 2010 and 7% in 2009, primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television and feature film content, including print and advertising. Participation, distribution and royalty costs increased 17% to $814 million in 2011 from $693 million in 2010 primarily reflecting higher participations from the licensing of titles for digital streaming and the mix of domestic syndication sales, partially offset by lower advertising and other distribution costs from the timing of theatrical film releases. For 2010, participation, distribution and royalty costs increased 16% to $693 million from $597 million in 2009 primarily reflecting higher advertising expenses for theatrical films. Other operating expenses, which represented 19% of total operating expenses for each of the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, primarily include compensation costs, costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing, and costs associated with the production and hosting of websites. For 2011, other operating expenses decreased 5% to $1.61 billion from $1.69 billion in 2010 primarily reflecting lower costs associated with the absence of sponsorship revenues resulting from the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament. For 2010, other operating expenses remained relatively flat at $1.69 billion compared to 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, which include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support, represented 19% of revenues for each of the years 2011, 2010 and 2009. SG&A expenses increased $140 million, or 5%, to $2.76 billion in 2011 from $2.62 billion in 2010 principally due to a settlement of $90 million recorded in 2010 related to the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses, higher advertising and increased selling expenses primarily associated with higher revenues, partially offset by $36 million lower pension and postretirement benefit costs primarily due to the favorable performance of pension plan assets in 2010. For 2010, SG&A expenses increased $127 million, or 5%, to $2.62 billion from $2.49 billion in 2009 principally reflecting higher advertising, selling expenses and incentive compensation driven by the improved operating results, partially offset by $51 million lower pension and postretirement benefits costs primarily due to the favorable performance of pension plan assets in 2009. Comparability of SG&A expenses was impacted by settlements related to the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses of $90 million in 2010 and $28 million in 2009 and gains of $40 million in 2009 from the sale and exchange of certain long lived assets. II 8 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Restructuring Charges During the year ended December 31, 2011, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans, which primarily included relocation or closure of certain business activities, as well as other exit activities. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $46 million, reflecting $34 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and $12 million of severance costs. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $81 million and $23 million, respectively. The charges reflected $87 million of severance costs and $22 million of contract termination and other associated costs, partially offset by reversals of $5 million as a result of changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. As of December 31, 2011, the cumulative amount paid for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 restructuring charges was $100 million, of which $81 million was for severance costs and $19 million was related to contract termination and other associated costs. The Company expects to substantially utilize the remaining reserves by the end of 2013. Balance at December 31, 2010 2011 Charges 2011 Payments Balance at December 31, 2011 Entertainment $ 11 $ 40 $ (9 ) $ 42 Cable Networks 2 (1 ) 1 Publishing 2 2 (2 ) 2 Local Broadcasting 13 (8 ) 5 Outdoor 16 4 (15 ) 5 Total $ 44 $ 46 $ (35 ) $ 55 Balance at December 31, 2009 2010 Charges 2010 Payments Balance at December 31, 2010 Entertainment $ $ 23 $ (12 ) $ 11 Cable Networks 3 (1 ) 2 Publishing 2 4 (4 ) 2 Local Broadcasting 4 25 (16 ) 13 Outdoor 6 26 (16 ) 16 Total $ 12 $ 81 $ (49 ) $ 44 Impairment Charges The Company performs an annual fair value based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily comprised of FCC licenses, during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived intangible asset below its carrying value. Based on the results of the 2011 and 2010 annual impairment tests no impairment charge was required. During 2009, as a result of the Companys annual impairment test of FCC licenses, the Company recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $178 million at the Local Broadcasting segment to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets. This impairment resulted from reductions in projections for advertising revenues due to a weakened radio advertising marketplace. II 9  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Also in 2009, in connection with the sale of certain of its radio stations, the Company recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $32 million to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses by $21 million and the allocated goodwill by $11 million. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization decreased $15 million, or 3%, to $548 million for 2011 from $563 million for 2010 principally reflecting lower depreciation and amortization associated with reduced capital expenditures in recent years. For 2010, depreciation and amortization decreased $20 million, or 3%, to $563 million from $583 million for 2009 principally reflecting lower depreciation for outdoor advertising properties and lower depreciation and amortization associated with interactive businesses. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $93 million, or 18%, to $436 million for 2011 and decreased $13 million, or 2%, to $529 million for 2010 from $542 million for 2009, in both cases primarily resulting from the reduction of debt during 2010. The Company had $5.98 billion and $6.00 billion of principal amounts of debt outstanding (including current maturities) at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, each at a weighted average interest rate of 7%. Interest Income Interest income increased $1 million to $7 million for 2011 from $6 million for 2010. For 2010, interest income was flat at $6 million compared to 2009. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt For 2010, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $81 million was associated with the repurchase and redemption of $2.07 billion of the Companys debt, of which $750 million was repurchased through a tender offer. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). For 2009, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $30 million was associated with the repurchase of $978 million of the Companys debt, of which $826 million was repurchased through a tender offer. Other Items, Net For 2011, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $17 million primarily consisting of foreign exchange losses. For 2010, "Other items, net" of $10 million primarily consisted of gains of $21 million associated with dispositions, partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $10 million. For 2009, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $2 million primarily consisting of losses of $7 million associated with securitizing accounts receivables and a non cash charge of $8 million associated with other than temporary declines in the market value of the Companys investments, partially offset by foreign exchange gains of $11 million. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For II 10 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2011, the provision for income taxes increased to $755 million from $463 million in 2010 and for 2010, the provision for income taxes increased from $183 million in 2009. These increases were primarily driven by the increase in earnings before income taxes. In addition, the provision for income taxes for 2010 included a $62 million reduction of deferred tax assets associated with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, partially offset by a $26 million reversal of previously established deferred tax liabilities and a tax benefit of $28 million from the settlement of income tax audits. Included in the Companys tax provision for 2009 were tax benefits of $47 million from settlements of income tax audits, a benefit of $79 million associated with the non cash impairment charges, and reductions of deferred tax assets associated with stock based compensation of $43 million. This reduction reflected the difference between the estimated tax benefit recognized based on the grant date fair value of the stock based compensation award versus the actual tax benefit realized based on the market value on the date of vest. The Companys effective income tax rate was 36% in 2011, 38% in 2010 and 41% in 2009. For 2012, the Companys annual effective tax rate is expected to be similar to 2011 and 2010 levels. Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, was $37 million for 2011, $35 million for 2010 and $33 million for 2009 reflecting the Companys share of the operating results of its equity investments. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations The Company reported net earnings from continuing operations of $1.29 billion for 2011, $724 million for 2010 and $227 million for 2009. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations During 2011, the Company reached favorable resolutions of certain contingencies related to its previously disposed businesses which are accounted for as discontinued operations. As a result, a pre tax gain of $23 million ($14 million, net of tax) was recorded in discontinued operations. Net Earnings The Company reported net earnings of $1.31 billion for 2011, $724 million for 2010 and $227 million for 2009, principally driven by the growth in operating income and a decline in interest expense. In addition, comparability of net earnings was impacted by several large discrete items, including pre tax non cash impairment charges of $210 million ($131 million, net of tax) in 2009, settlements of $90 million in 2010 and $28 million in 2009 from the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses, restructuring charges of $46 million in 2011, $81 million in 2010 and $23 million in 2009, and pre tax losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $81 million in 2010 and $30 million in 2009. Reconciliation of Non GAAP Financial Information Free cash flow is a non GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Companys net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program and less capital expenditures. The Companys net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Companys calculation of free cash flow for 2009 does not include increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program because the Company does not consider the cash flow from this II 11 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) program to be indicative of the cash generated by the underlying operating performance of the Company. Accordingly, the Company considers its decision to increase or decrease its accounts receivable securitization program a financing decision. In 2010, as a result of the adoption of amended FASB guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets, increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program are reflected as financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Under the previous guidance these changes were reflected as operating activities. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Also, the Companys calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures since investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Companys operations. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Companys ability to generate long term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Companys operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Companys underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is also a primary measure used externally by the Companys investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry. As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, and does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Companys ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are not reflected in free cash flow. The following table presents a reconciliation of the Companys net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net cash flow provided by operating activities $ 1,749 $ 1,735 $ 939 Exclude: Decrease to accounts receivable securitization program 150 Capital expenditures (265 ) (284 ) (262 ) Free cash flow $ 1,484 $ 1,451 $ 827 II 12 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Segment Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 The following tables present the Companys revenues, segment operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and impairment charges ("Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges" or "Segment OIBDA" if there is no impairment charge), operating income (loss), depreciation and amortization, and impairment charges by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. The Company presents Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges (or Segment OIBDA) as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Companys management and enhances their ability to understand the Companys operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges to the Companys consolidated Net earnings (loss) is presented in Note 14 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 7,457 $ 7,391 $ 6,977 OIBDA $ 1,391 $ 871 $ 876 Depreciation and amortization (160 ) (163 ) (176 ) Operating income $ 1,231 $ 708 $ 700 OIBDA as a % of revenues 19% 12% 13% Operating income as a % of revenues 17% 10% 10% Restructuring charges $ 40 $ 23 $ Capital expenditures $ 94 $ 90 $ 72 2011 vs. 2010 For 2011, Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $7.46 billion from $7.39 billion in 2010. This growth was led by 10% higher revenues from domestic and international television license fees, driven by licensing agreements for digital streaming, partially offset by lower contributions from significant domestic syndication availabilities, which included the third cycle domestic cable sale of Frasier in 2011 and the second cycle sale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in 2010. Revenue growth also reflects higher retransmission revenues and underlying advertising revenue increases from higher pricing for the broadcast of sporting events and higher primetime advertising for the CBS Television Network. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network as well as the impact of the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament, which resulted in lower revenues, but higher profits for 2011. For 2011, Entertainment operating income increased $523 million, or 74% to $1.23 billion from $708 million in 2010 and OIBDA increased $520 million, or 60%, to $1.39 billion from $871 million for 2010 with improved operating income and OIBDA margins of seven percentage points to 17% and 19%, respectively. The operating income and OIBDA increases, and margin improvement reflect the aforementioned revenue growth, significantly lower sports programming costs resulting from the new programming agreement for the NCAA Tournament and the absence of the 2010 Super Bowl broadcast on the CBS Television Network, as well as cost decreases associated with the timing of production and distribution expenses. Restructuring charges of $40 million in 2011 principally reflect costs associated with exiting operating facilities and severance costs. For 2010, restructuring charges of $23 million principally reflect severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Entertainment results included stock based compensation expense of $45 million for 2011 and $43 million for 2010. License fees for completed television programming in syndication, on cable and video on demand, and digitally streamed are recorded as revenues in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were $1.25 billion and $654 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. II 15 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2010 vs. 2009 For 2010, Entertainment revenues increased 6% to $7.39 billion from $6.98 billion in 2009 primarily reflecting higher advertising and retransmission revenues, partially offset by lower content licensing and distribution revenues. Advertising revenues increased 11% primarily reflecting higher national advertising revenues, driven by higher pricing due to the economic recovery and the strength of Network primetime and sports programming, including the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network, as well as growth in CBS Interactive display advertising revenues. Revenues from content licensing and distribution decreased 3% as higher international syndication sales, the second cycle sale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and the addition of theatrical revenues in 2010, were more than offset by the first cycle domestic syndication sales of five major titles in 2009. For 2010, Entertainment operating income increased 1% to $708 million from $700 million for 2009 and OIBDA decreased $5 million to $871 million from $876 million in 2009 as the increase in revenues was more than offset by higher sports programming costs, principally attributable to Super Bowl XLIV and the 2010 NCAA Tournament, increased investment in television and film content, and restructuring charges of $23 million incurred in 2010. Entertainment results included stock based compensation expense of $43 million for 2010 and $44 million for 2009. Capital expenditures increased $18 million to $90 million in 2010 from $72 million in 2009 primarily due to increased spending for high definition upgrades. Cable Networks (Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks) (Contributed 11% to consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 10% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.) Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 1,621 $ 1,475 $ 1,347 OIBDA $ 707 $ 566 $ 461 Depreciation and amortization (23 ) (23 ) (24 ) Operating income $ 684 $ 543 $ 437 OIBDA as a % of revenues 44% 38% 34% Operating income as a % of revenues 42% 37% 32% Restructuring charges $ $ 3 $ Capital expenditures $ 15 $ 19 $ 8 2011 vs. 2010 For 2011, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% to $1.62 billion from $1.48 billion in 2010 primarily driven by 7% higher affiliate revenues reflecting rate increases and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks, as well as higher licensing revenues from international syndication, digital streaming and home entertainment sales of Showtime original series. As of December 31, 2011 subscriptions totaled 73 million for Showtime Networks, including Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, 44 million for CBS Sports Network and 12 million for Smithsonian Networks. For 2011, Cable Networks operating income increased 26% to $684 million from $543 million in 2010 and OIBDA increased 25% to $707 million from $566 million for 2010, primarily due to revenue growth II 16 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) and lower costs for theatrical programming, partially offset by higher programming and advertising costs for Showtime original series. Cable Networks results included stock based compensation expense of $4 million for 2011 and $5 million for 2010. 2010 vs. 2009 For 2010, Cable Networks revenues increased 10% to $1.48 billion from $1.35 billion in 2009 primarily due to 8% higher affiliate fees, reflecting rate increases and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks and CBS Sports Network, as well as higher revenues from the licensing of Showtime original series. As of December 31, 2010 subscriptions totaled 67 million for Showtime Networks, including Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, 39 million for CBS Sports Network, and 7 million for Smithsonian Networks. For 2010, Cable Networks operating income increased 24% to $543 million from $437 million in 2009 and OIBDA increased 23% to $566 million from $461 million for 2009, primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher marketing and advertising costs for new Showtime original series as well as to support the overall growth of Showtime Networks and higher costs for sports programming. Restructuring charges of $3 million in 2010 principally reflect costs associated with exiting an operating facility. Cable Networks results included stock based compensation expense of $5 million for 2010 and $6 million for 2009. Capital expenditures increased $11 million to $19 million in 2010 from $8 million in 2009 primarily due to increased spending on high definition upgrades and leasehold improvements. Publishing (Simon & Schuster) (Contributed 6% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.) Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 787 $ 791 $ 793 OIBDA $ 90 $ 68 $ 50 Depreciation and amortization (7 ) (7 ) (7 ) Operating income $ 83 $ 61 $ 43 OIBDA as a % of revenues 11% 9% 6% Operating income as a % of revenues 11% 8% 5% Restructuring charges $ 2 $ 4 $ 4 Capital expenditures $ 7 $ 6 $ 5 2011 vs. 2010 For 2011, Publishing revenues decreased 1% to $787 million from $791 million in 2010 as strong growth in digital sales of Publishing content was offset by lower print book sales. Revenues from digital content of $133 million for 2011 more than doubled 2010 digital sales and represented 17% of total Publishing revenues in 2011. Best selling titles in 2011 included Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson and 11/22/63 by Stephen King. For 2011, Publishing operating income increased 36% to $83 million from $61 million in 2010 and OIBDA increased 32% to $90 million from $68 million for 2010 driven by lower direct operating costs, II 17 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) including expense decreases resulting from the significant increase in more profitable digital revenues as a percentage of total revenues, lower bad debt expense and the impact of cost containment measures. Restructuring charges in 2011 and 2010 reflect severance costs. Publishing results included stock based compensation expense of $3 million for both 2011 and 2010. 2010 vs. 2009 For 2010, Publishing revenues decreased slightly to $791 million from $793 million in 2009 primarily reflecting lower book sales in the adult group, partially offset by growth in sales of digital content of 122%. Revenues from digital content represent 8% of total Publishing revenues in 2010. Best selling titles in 2010 included Glenn Becks Broke and The Overton Window and Spoken from the Heart by Laura Bush. For 2010, Publishing operating income increased 42% to $61 million from $43 million in 2009 and OIBDA increased 36% to $68 million from $50 million for 2009 reflecting lower production expenses from a change in the mix of titles and the impact of cost reduction measures, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. The restructuring charges in 2010 and 2009 reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Publishing results included stock based compensation expense of $3 million for 2010 and $4 million for 2009. Local Broadcasting (CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio) (Contributed 19%, 20% and 18% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.) Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 2,689 $ 2,782 $ 2,360 OIBDA before impairment charges $ 849 $ 840 $ 513 Impairment charges (210 ) Depreciation and amortization (99 ) (100 ) (91 ) Operating income $ 750 $ 740 $ 212 OIBDA before impairment charges as a % of revenues 32% 30% 22% Operating income as a % of revenues 28% 27% 9% Restructuring charges $ $ 25 $ 2 Capital expenditures $ 69 $ 74 $ 71 2011 vs. 2010 For 2011, Local Broadcasting revenues decreased 3% to $2.69 billion from $2.78 billion for 2010 principally driven by lower political advertising sales. CBS Television Stations revenues decreased 7% due to the difficult comparison to the prior year, which included significant political advertising for midterm elections and revenues from the 2010 Super Bowl broadcast. Comparability was also impacted by lost revenues resulting from the National Basketball Association lockout during 2011. These decreases were partially offset by growth in many key advertising categories, led by domestic automotive and financial services as well as higher retransmission revenues. CBS Radio revenues increased slightly from the prior year, despite lower political advertising spending, reflecting growth in domestic auto, financial services and retail advertising. II 18 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) For 2011, Local Broadcasting operating income increased 1% to $750 million from $740 million in 2010 and OIBDA increased 1% to $849 million from $840 million for 2010 primarily due to lower programming and production costs for syndicated and sports programming, and restructuring charges of $25 million recorded in 2010, partially offset by the revenue decline. Local Broadcasting results included stock based compensation expense of $22 million for 2011 and $20 million for 2010. 2010 vs. 2009 For 2010, Local Broadcasting revenues increased 18% to $2.78 billion from $2.36 billion for 2009 driven by growth in advertising sales. CBS Television Stations revenues increased 27% as a result of the improved local advertising marketplace with growth across many key categories, led by automotive, retail and financial services, as well as higher political advertising for midterm election, and the benefit of the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl XLIV to the Companys owned CBS affiliated stations. CBS Radio revenues for 2010 increased 9% reflecting the improved advertising marketplace with growth in many key categories, led by automotive and retail, and higher political advertising sales. For 2010, Local Broadcasting operating income increased $528 million to $740 million from $212 million for 2009. Included in 2009 operating income were non cash impairment charges of $210 million. Local Broadcasting OIBDA before impairment charges increased 64% to $840 million for 2010 from $513 million for 2009 and OIBDA before impairment charges margins increased to 30% in 2010 from 22% in 2009. These increases were primarily driven by the revenue growth, and lower programming and talent expenses due to expense reduction measures, partially offset by gains of $40 million recorded in 2009 from the sale and exchange of certain long lived assets and higher restructuring charges in 2010. Restructuring charges of $25 million for 2010 reflect severance costs associated with the elimination of positions, and contract terminations and other associated costs. Local Broadcasting results included stock based compensation of $20 million for 2010 and $21 million for 2009. Dispositions In August 2010, the Company completed the sale of its television station in Norfolk, Virginia to Local TV Holdings, LLC, for $17 million, resulting in a pre tax gain of $8 million included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010. On September 30, 2009, the Company completed the sale of four of its owned radio stations in Portland, Oregon to Alpha Broadcasting for $40 million. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of $32 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets and the allocated goodwill. On April 1, 2009, the Company completed a transaction with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. for the swap of five of its mid size market stations in Baltimore, Portland, Sacramento and Seattle, for two radio stations in Houston, a top 10 radio market. On March 6, 2009, the Company completed the sale of three of its owned radio stations in Denver to Wilks Broadcasting for $20 million. II 19  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Outdoor (CBS Outdoor) (Contributed 13% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.) Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 1,894 $ 1,819 $ 1,723 OIBDA $ 342 $ 263 $ 169 Depreciation and amortization (235 ) (249 ) (266 ) Operating income (loss) $ 107 $ 14 $ (97 ) OIBDA as a % of revenues 18% 14% 10% Operating income as a % of revenues 6% 1% NM Restructuring charges $ 4 $ 26 $ 17 Capital expenditures $ 66 $ 78 $ 91 NM Not meaningful 2011 vs. 2010 For 2011, Outdoor revenues increased 4% to $1.89 billion from $1.82 billion in 2010 reflecting further improvement in the outdoor advertising marketplace in the Americas (comprising North America and South America) and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Revenues for the Americas increased 5% (4% in constant dollars) to $1.29 billion, reflecting growth in the U.S. billboards and displays businesses driven by rate increases. Revenues for Europe increased 3% to $608 million for 2011 primarily due to foreign exchange rate changes. In constant dollars, revenues for Europe decreased 2% reflecting weakness in the European economy. The favorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $33 million for 2011. Approximately 44% and 45% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2011 and 2010, respectively. For 2011, Outdoor operating income increased $93 million to $107 million from $14 million in 2010. Outdoor OIBDA increased 30% to $342 million for 2011 from $263 million for 2010 and Outdoor OIBDA margins increased to 18% for 2011 from 14% for 2010. These increases were primarily driven by the revenue growth and decreased costs resulting from lower restructuring charges, the mix of more profitable contracts and the settlement of legal matters in 2011. Restructuring charges of $4 million for 2011 reflect severance costs. Outdoor results included stock based compensation expense of $6 million for 2011 and $5 million for 2010. Due to the challenging advertising marketplace worldwide, certain transit contracts, including the London Underground contact, are operating at their minimum guarantee levels. Capital expenditures decreased $12 million to $66 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 principally reflecting decreased capital spending in Europe. 2010 vs. 2009 For 2010, Outdoor revenues increased 6% to $1.82 billion from $1.72 billion for 2009 reflecting the improved advertising marketplace. Revenues for the Americas increased 10% (8% in constant dollars) to $1.23 billion, primarily reflecting stronger U.S. billboards and displays businesses driven by higher occupancy rates, the impact of new transit contracts, and increases in Canada. Revenues for Europe of II 20 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) $592 million for 2010 remained relatively flat compared to 2009. In constant dollars, revenues for Europe increased 3% from 2009 reflecting revenue growth in the United Kingdom, Holland and Italy, partially offset by lower revenues in France. Revenues for Asia decreased $13 million to $2 million for 2010 reflecting the deconsolidation of Outdoor China. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company sold its controlling interest in Outdoor China, resulting in the deconsolidation of the operations and its subsequent treatment as an equity method investment. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $4 million for 2010. Approximately 45% and 47% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2010 and 2009, respectively. For 2010, Outdoor reported operating income of $14 million versus an operating loss of $97 million for 2009. Outdoor OIBDA increased 56% to $263 million for 2010 from $169 million for 2009 and Outdoor OIBDA margins increased to 14% for 2010 from 10% for 2009. These increases were driven by the revenue growth as well as lower billboard lease, maintenance and display site costs from cost savings initiatives and lost contracts, partially offset by costs for new transit contracts and higher restructuring charges. Restructuring charges of $26 million for 2010 primarily reflect severance costs associated with the elimination of positions in Europe. Outdoor results included stock based compensation expense of $5 million for 2010 versus $6 million for 2009. Capital expenditures decreased $13 million to $78 million in 2010 from $91 million in 2009 principally reflecting decreased spending for transit contracts in the United Kingdom. Corporate For 2011, corporate expenses increased 5% to $252 million from $239 million for 2010 primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation associated with the Companys improved operating results. For 2010, corporate expenses increased 44% to $239 million from $166 million for 2009 primarily reflecting the absence of the 2009 favorable impact from the termination of a real estate lease arrangement and higher incentive compensation. Corporate expenses included stock based compensation expense of $60 million for 2011 and 2010, and $55 million for 2009. Residual Costs Residual costs primarily include pension and postretirement benefits costs for plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. Residual costs were $75 million for 2011, $15 million for 2010 and $116 million for 2009. Comparability was impacted by settlements of $90 million in 2010 and $28 million in 2009 related to the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses. In addition, residual costs for 2011 and 2010 benefited from the favorable performance of pension plan assets in 2010 and 2009, as well as the pre funding of the Companys pension plans during 2010 and 2009. Financial Position Current assets increased by $148 million to $5.54 billion at December 31, 2011 from $5.40 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $180 million. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables decreased to 3.4% at December 31, 2011 compared with 3.9% at December 31, 2010, primarily due to the write off of previously reserved receivables. II 21 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Net property and equipment of $2.51 billion at December 31, 2011 decreased by $184 million from $2.69 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $426 million and fixed asset dispositions, partially offset by capital expenditures of $265 million. Goodwill increased by $96 million to $8.62 billion at December 31, 2011 from $8.52 billion at December 31, 2010 primarily reflecting acquisitions of domestic and international internet businesses, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments. Intangible assets, principally consisting of FCC licenses, leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, decreased by $98 million to $6.53 billion at December 31, 2011 from $6.62 billion at December 31, 2010 due to amortization expense of $122 million, partially offset by intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of internet businesses. Pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased by $147 million to $1.84 billion at December 31, 2011 from $1.99 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting pension contributions made during 2011, principally to pre fund the Companys qualified plans, partially offset by actuarial losses resulting from the decrease in the discount rate and other changes to actuarial assumptions. Other liabilities decreased $143 million to $2.38 billion at December 31, 2011 from $2.52 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting decreases related to programming rights. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased by $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $237 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and increased by $297 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,749 $ 1,735 $ 939 Cash used for investing activities (389 ) (368 ) (249 ) Cash used for financing activities (1,180 ) (1,604 ) (393 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 180 $ (237 ) $ 297 Operating Activities. In 2011, cash provided by operating activities increased $14 million to $1.75 billion from $1.74 billion in 2010 principally driven by growth in operating income and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher contributions to the Companys qualified pension plans and lower contributions from changes in working capital. Working capital reflected a use of cash in 2011, principally due to the timing of collections from television licensing arrangements, and a source of cash in 2010 mainly from the Super Bowl telecast on the CBS Television Network. In 2010, cash provided by operating activities increased $796 million to $1.74 billion from $939 million in 2009 principally reflecting higher operating income, the timing of programming payments and a $150 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the companys accounts receivable securitization program during 2009. These increases were partially offset by higher payments for taxes and higher discretionary contributions to pre fund the Companys qualified pension plans. On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets and as a result, decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program during 2010 are reflected as cash flows used for financing activities. II 22 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The Company made pension contributions of $410 million in 2011, $167 million in 2010 and $20 million in 2009, principally to pre fund its qualified plans. Cash paid for income taxes was $235 million for 2011, $248 million for 2010 and $56 million for 2009. The decrease in cash taxes for 2011 was driven by tax benefits from funding the Companys qualified pension plans and the exercise and vesting of stock based compensation, partially offset by higher tax payments associated with an increase in taxable income. The increase in cash taxes for 2010 reflects higher taxable income and the impact of refunds received during 2009 resulting from the filing of income tax returns for prior years.

In 2011, cash used for investing activities of $389 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $265 million, investments in investee companies of $79 million, principally reflecting investment in The CW and international television ventures, and payment for acquisitions of $75 million, primarily for internet businesses, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $22 million. In 2010, cash used for investing activities of $368 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $284 million and investments in investee companies of $90 million, principally reflecting investment in The CW and international television ventures, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $18 million, primarily from the sale of a television station. In 2009, cash used for investing activities of $249 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $262 million, investments in investee companies of $56 million, principally reflecting investment in The CW, and purchases of marketable securities of $36 million, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $131 million, primarily from the sales of radio stations and certain long lived assets of the Local Broadcasting segment. Capital expenditures were $265 million in 2011, $284 million in 2010 and $262 million in 2009. For 2012, capital expenditures are anticipated to be at similar levels as the prior three years. Financing Activities. In 2011, cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion principally reflected the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $1.01 billion under the Companys share repurchase program, dividend payments of $206 million and the payment of employee payroll taxes in lieu of issuing shares for restricted stock unit vests of $82 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $72 million and the excess tax benefit from stock based compensation of $72 million. For 2010, cash used for financing activities of $1.60 billion principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $2.13 billion, a $400 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the account receivable securitization program and dividend payments of $142 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $1.09 billion. In 2009, cash used for financing activities of $393 million principally reflected the repayment of senior debt of $1.01 billion and dividend payments of $297 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $973 million. Dividends On February 23, 2012, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.10 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2012. The Company declared a quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the four quarters of 2011, 2010 and 2009, resulting in total annual dividends of $237 million, $139 million and $136 million, respectively. During 2011, the Company increased its quarterly cash dividend from $.05 to $.10, beginning with the dividend paid in the third quarter. Dividends have been recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital as the Company has an accumulated deficit balance. II 23 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Share Repurchase Program During 2011, the Company repurchased 42.2 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $1.02 billion under its share repurchase program, on a trade date basis. At December 31, 2011, there was $1.98 billion of authorization remaining under the repurchase program, which the Company expects to use by the end of 2013, subject to market conditions. Capital Structure At December 31, 2011 2010 Senior debt (4.30% 8.875% due 2012 2056) $ 5,925 $ 5,929 Other notes 2 Obligations under capital leases 78 90 Total debt (a) 6,003 6,021 Less discontinued operations debt (b) 21 21 Total debt from continuing operations 5,982 6,000 Less current portion 24 27 Total long term debt from continuing operations, net of current portion $ 5,958 $ 5,973 (a)At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized premium of $4 million and $1 million, respectively, and (ii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of $75 million and $83 million, respectively. The face value of the Companys total debt was $5.92 billion at December 31, 2011 and $5.94 billion at December 31, 2010. (b)Included in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Total debt of $6.00 billion at December 31, 2011 and $6.02 billion at December 31, 2010 was 38% as a percentage of the total capitalization of the Company. The senior debt of CBS Corp., is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Operations Inc. Senior debt in the amount of $52 million of the Companys wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Broadcasting Inc., has no guarantor. At December 31, 2011, the Company classified $490 million of senior notes and debentures maturing in August 2012 as long term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, reflecting its intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long term basis. For the year ended December 31, 2010, debt issuances, redemptions and repurchases were as follows: Debt Issuances October 2010, $300 million 4.30% senior notes due 2021 October 2010, $300 million 5.90% senior notes due 2040 April 2010, $500 million 5.75% senior notes due 2020 Debt Redemptions $544 million 6.625% senior notes due 2011 $415 million 7.70% senior notes due 2010 $335 million 7.25% senior notes due 2051 II 24 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Debt Repurchases $400 million 6.625% senior notes due 2011, through a tender offer $98 million 8.625% debentures due 2012, through tender offers $252 million 5.625% senior notes due 2012, through tender offers $6 million 6.625% senior notes due 2011 $19 million 5.50% senior debentures due 2033 These redemptions and repurchases resulted in a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $81 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the Companys scheduled maturities of long term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 and Thereafter Long term debt $ 490 $ $ 499 $ $ 200 $ 4,657 Credit Facility At December 31, 2011, the Company had a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in December 2015 (the "Credit Facility"). The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Companys option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Companys senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.0x at the end of each quarter and a minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio of 3.0x for the trailing four quarters, each as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2011, the Companys Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 1.8x and Consolidated Coverage Ratio was approximately 7.8x. The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Companys indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Companys Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other non cash items. The Consolidated Coverage Ratio reflects the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to the Companys cash interest expense on indebtedness, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, in each case for the trailing four consecutive quarters. The primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings under its $2.0 billion commercial paper program. At December 31, 2011, the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $1.98 billion. II 25 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Accounts Receivable Securitization Program The Company participated in a revolving accounts receivable securitization program, prior to the end of the first quarter of 2010, which provided for the sale of receivables on a non recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one year renewable basis. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company reduced the amounts outstanding under its revolving accounts receivable securitization program to zero from $400 million at December 31, 2009 and terminated the program. On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets which required the Companys securitized accounts receivables to be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding increase to debt. As a result, the decrease to the accounts receivable securitization program of $400 million during 2010 is reflected as cash flows used for financing activities and the decrease of $150 million during 2009 is reflected as cash flows used for operating activities under previous FASB guidance. During the period before the termination of the program in 2010 and for the year ended December 31, 2009, proceeds from collections of securitized accounts receivables of $263 million and $1.47 billion, respectively, were reinvested in the revolving receivable securitization program. The net loss associated with securitizing the programs accounts receivables was $1 million for 2010 and $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Companys operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, franchise payments, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Companys investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $1.98 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2011, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. The Companys funding for short term and long term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short term borrowing needs. Funding for the Companys long term debt obligations due over the next five years of $1.19 billion is expected to come from cash generated from operating activities and the Companys ability to refinance its debt. II 26  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2011 the Companys significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 and thereafter Programming and talent commitments (a) $ 16,913 $ 2,762 $ 3,400 $ 2,863 $ 7,888 Guaranteed minimum franchise payments (b) 1,358 416 615 233 94 Purchase obligations (c) 807 313 343 74 77 Operating leases (d) 2,237 320 520 403 994 Other long term contractual obligations (e) 1,031 850 140 41 Long term debt obligations (f) 5,846 490 499 200 4,657 Interest commitments on long term debt (g) 6,204 394 723 650 4,437 Capital lease obligations (including interest) (h) 96 22 25 18 31 Total $ 34,492 $ 4,717 $ 6,975 $ 4,581 $ 18,219 (a)Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $12.90 billion for sports programming rights, $3.22 billion relating to television, radio, and film production and licensing and $796 million for talent contracts. (b)Outdoor has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. (c)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (d)Consists of long term operating lease commitments for office space, billboards, equipment, transponders and studio facilities. Total future minimum payments of $2.24 billion include $879 million for Outdoor billboards. (e)Long term contractual obligations recorded on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals. (f)Long term debt obligations are presented at face value, including discontinued operations debt. (g)Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases. (h)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders. The table above excludes future contributions to the Companys pension plans and $195 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and periods in which cash payments relating to these items are expected to occur. In 2012, the Company expects to contribute approximately $55 million primarily to its non qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. The Company, at its discretion, may make additional contributions in 2012 to pre fund its qualified pension plans. Also in 2012, the Company expects to contribute approximately $70 million to its other postretirement benefit plans, to satisfy the Companys portion of benefit payments due under these plans. II 27 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2011, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $389 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Prior to the separation of former Viacom Inc. into CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. on December 31, 2005, former Viacom had entered into guarantees with respect to obligations related to Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster"), including certain Blockbuster store leases; Famous Players theater leases; certain UCI theater leases; and certain theater leases related to W.F. Cinema Holdings L.P. In connection with the separation, Viacom Inc. has agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these guarantees. In addition, the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to indemnify each other with respect to certain other matters pursuant to the separation agreement between the parties. In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Companys significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Programming and Production Costs Accounting for television and theatrical film production costs requires managements judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned ("Ultimate Revenues") and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or theatrical film. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program or theatrical film, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs or theatrical films. II 28 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The costs incurred in acquiring television programs are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. Managements judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program. Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming and theatrical films, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming are updated regularly based on information available as the television program and theatrical film progresses through its life cycle. Overestimating ultimate revenues or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and estimated accruals for participation expense. Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily comprised of FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. For its annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2011 the Company early adopted amended FASB guidance which permits the Company to choose to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If based on this assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary. For 2011, the Company performed this qualitative assessment for six reporting units that each had an estimated fair value for the 2010 annual impairment test that was in excess of its carrying value by 20% or more. For each reporting unit, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included the results of the most recent impairment tests, as well as financial performance and changes to the reporting units carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry during 2011, where applicable. The Company concluded that each of the reporting unit specific and industry factors had either a positive or neutral impact on the fair value of each of the reporting units. The Company also determined that macroeconomic factors during 2011 did not have a significant impact on the discount rates and growth rates used for the 2010 annual impairment tests. Based on the qualitative assessment, the Company concluded that for these six reporting units, performing the two step impairment test was unnecessary and no impairment charge was required for 2011. The Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test for the remaining three reporting units. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test requires the Company to then compare the implied fair value of that reporting units goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill to determine the amount of impairment charge, if any. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows ("Discounted Cash Flow Method") and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses ("Market Comparable Method"). For 2011, the Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in substantially equal fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds II 29 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Companys internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long range inflation and long term industry projections, and for 2011 was between 2.0% and 3.0%. The discount rates, which for 2011 ranged from 8.5% to 10.0%, are determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market or a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non cash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet. Based on the 2011 annual impairment test, the Company concluded that the fair value of each of the three reporting units for which the Company performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test exceeded their respective carrying values. The individual carrying values of the following reporting units were within 10% of their respective estimated fair values: Significant Assumptions Reporting Unit Reporting Unit Fair Value in Excess of Carrying Value Perpetual Nominal Growth Rate Discount Rate CBS Interactive 9 % 3.0 % 10.0% CBS Radio 9 % 2.0 % 8.5% At December 31, 2011 the carrying value of goodwill for the CBS Interactive and CBS Radio reporting units was $974 million and $1.89 billion, respectively. An increase to the discount rates of 60 basis points and 65 basis points for Interactive and Radio, respectively, or a decrease to the perpetual nominal growth rates of 105 basis points and 95 basis points for Interactive and Radio, respectively, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair values of these reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non cash impairment charge. FCC Licenses FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset by geographic market with its carrying value. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Companys radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method ("Greenfield Method"), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the start up stations II 30 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) operating costs and capital expenditures, and a three year build up period for the start up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. In order to estimate the revenues of a start up station, the total market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are similarly estimated based on industry average data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long range inflation in the U.S. and long term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry. The discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each television and radio station for 2011 were as follows: Reporting Unit Discount Rate Perpetual Nominal Growth Rate Television stations 8.0 % 2.5% Radio stations 8.5 % 2.0% The assumptions used in determining fair values of the FCC licenses require management to make significant judgments. Certain events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital or a decline in the local radio or television advertising markets, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television and radio stations. Deterioration in the economic conditions or a change in population size of any individual geographic market could adversely impact advertisers ability or willingness to purchase advertising on the radio and television stations in that market. Advertising expenditures by companies in certain industries, including automotive, entertainment and retail, have historically represented a significant portion of the local radio and television advertising revenues in all geographic markets. As a result, a decrease in spending by advertisers in these categories or adverse economic conditions, particularly in larger markets such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, where the Company holds FCC licenses with substantial carrying values, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the FCC licenses. Based on the 2011 annual impairment test, the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses in each radio and television market exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was necessary. However, three radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $323 million, were each within 5% of their respective estimated fair value, and six radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $1.20 billion, were each within 10% of their respective estimated fair value. Additionally, one television market, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $74 million, was within 5% of its estimated fair value. In each of the remaining radio and television markets, the estimated fair value of FCC licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values at December 31, 2011 by more than 10%. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a non cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet. Reserves and Legal Matters Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company II 31 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. Pensions Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the weighted average yield on portfolios of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet each of the Companys pension plans expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2011, the unrecognized actuarial losses increased from the prior year end due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate as well as changes in other actuarial assumptions. A decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate will result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $100 million and will not have a material impact on the 2012 pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $9 million in 2012 pension expense. Income Taxes The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. During 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized tax benefits of $6 million and $28 million, respectively, related to the net impact of the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $195 million at December 31, 2011 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. II 32  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Legal Matters Securities Action. On December 12, 2008, the City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System filed a self styled class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Treasurer, alleging violations of federal securities law. The complaint, which was filed on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Companys common stock between February 26, 2008 and October 10, 2008 (the "Class Period"), alleges that, among other things, the Companys failure to timely write down the value of certain assets caused the Companys reported operating results during the Class Period to be materially inflated. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. On February 11, 2009, a motion was filed in the case on behalf of The City of Omaha, Nebraska Civilian Employees Retirement System, and The City of Omaha Police and Fire Retirement System (collectively, the "Omaha Funds") seeking to appoint the Omaha Funds as the lead plaintiffs in this case; on March 5, 2009, the court granted that motion. On May 4, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, which removes the Treasurer as a defendant and adds the Executive Chairman. On July 13, 2009, all defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action. On March 16, 2010, the court granted the Companys motion and dismissed this action as to the Company and all defendants. On April 30, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to serve an amended complaint. On September 23, 2010, the court issued an order granting leave to amend. On October 8, 2010, the Company was served with an Amended Complaint, which redefines the Class Period to be April 29, 2008 to October 10, 2008 and alleges that the impairment charge should have been taken during the first quarter of 2008. The Company filed a motion to dismiss this Amended Complaint on November 19, 2010. On May 24, 2011, the court granted the motion to dismiss and entered judgment in favor of defendants on May 25, 2011. On June 23, 2011, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. CBS Outdoor and London Underground Actions. Beginning in 2010, CBS Outdoor Limited filed legal proceedings and claims against London Underground Limited with respect to disputes arising under the 2006 transit contract between the parties, and London Underground Limited filed counterclaims with respect to its claims. In December 2011, the parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving these matters, which is not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. CBS Outdoor Limited continues to operate the London Underground advertising concession. E books Actions. Commencing on August 9, 2011, purported class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California regarding the sale of electronic books pursuant to agency distribution arrangements. On August 16, 2011, a motion was filed with the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the "MDL Panel") by certain parties seeking to consolidate these actions for pre trial proceedings in one venue. On December 9, 2011, the MDL Panel issued an order consolidating the actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On January 20, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint with the court against Apple Inc., Hachette Book Group, Inc., HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., Macmillan Publishers, Inc., Penguin Group (USA) Inc. and the Companys subsidiary, Simon & Schuster, Inc. The plaintiffs, electronic book purchasers, allege that, among other things, the defendants are in violation of federal and or state antitrust laws in connection with the sale of electronic books pursuant to agency distribution arrangements between each of the publishers and electronic book retailers. The actions generally seek multiple forms of damages for the purchase of electronic books and injunctive and other relief. Simon & Schuster intends to vigorously defend itself in these actions. In addition, certain federal and state governmental entities in the United States and the competition authority in the European Community are conducting competition II 33 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) investigations of agency distribution arrangements in this industry and Simon & Schuster is cooperating with these competition investigations. Indecency Regulation. In March 2006, the FCC released certain decisions relating to indecency complaints against certain of the Companys owned television stations and affiliated stations. The FCC ordered the Company to pay a forfeiture of $550,000 in the proceeding relating to the broadcast of a Super Bowl half time show by the Companys television stations (the "Super Bowl Proceeding"). In May 2006, the FCC denied the Companys petition for reconsideration. In July 2006, the Company filed a Petition for Review of the forfeiture with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and paid the $550,000 forfeiture in order to facilitate the Companys ability to bring the appeal. Oral argument was heard in September 2007. In July 2008, the Third Circuit vacated the FCCs order to have the Company pay the forfeiture and remanded the case to the FCC. On November 18, 2008, the FCC filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the Third Circuits decision. The petition requested that the United States Supreme Court not act on the petition until it ruled in the "fleeting expletives case" mentioned below. On January 8, 2009, the Company filed its opposition to the FCCs petition for certiorari. In another case involving broadcasts on another network, in June 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the FCCs November 2006 finding that the broadcast of fleeting and isolated expletives was indecent and remanded the case to the FCC (the "fleeting expletives case"). On March 17, 2008, the United States Supreme Court granted the FCCs petition to review the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuits decision. On November 4, 2008, the United States Supreme Court heard argument in this case. On April 28, 2009, the United States Supreme Court issued a 5 4 decision reversing the Second Circuits judgment on administrative grounds in favor of the FCC and remanding the fleeting expletives case to the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit requested additional briefing and argument was heard on January 13, 2010. On July 13, 2010, the Second Circuit struck down an FCC policy on indecency and found that the FCCs indecency policies and decisions regarding the use of "fleeting expletives" on radio and television violated the First Amendment. On August 25, 2010, the FCC filed a petition for rehearing en banc and, on August 31, 2010, the Second Circuit issued an order directing all parties and intervenors to file briefs in response to the FCCs petition on September 21, 2010, which were filed. On November 22, 2010, the Second Circuit denied the FCCs petition for rehearing. On April 21, 2011, the FCC filed a combined petition for certiorari seeking review of the Second Circuits decision in this case and also in an indecency case involving a broadcast on another television network. On June 27, 2011, the United States Supreme Court granted the FCCs petition for certiorari. On January 10, 2012, the United States Supreme Court heard oral argument in these cases. Following the April 28, 2009 decision in the fleeting expletives case, on May 4, 2009, the United States Supreme Court remanded the Super Bowl Proceeding to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and requested supplemental briefing from the Company and the FCC, in light of the United States Supreme Courts fleeting expletives decision. Argument was heard by the Third Circuit in the Super Bowl Proceeding on February 23, 2010. On May 18, 2010 and on December 22, 2010, at the Third Circuits request, the Company and the FCC each submitted supplemental briefs. On November 2, 2011, the Third Circuit upheld its earlier decision to vacate the FCCs order to have the Company pay the $550,000 forfeiture. In March 2006, the FCC also notified the Company and certain affiliates of the CBS Television Network of apparent liability for forfeitures relating to a broadcast of the program Without a Trace. The FCC proposed to assess a forfeiture of $32,500 against each of these stations, totaling $260,000 for the Companys owned stations. The Company is contesting the FCC decision and the proposed forfeitures. II 34 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Additionally, the Company, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on the Companys broadcasting stations included indecent material. Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Companys products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos containing insulating material in turbines sold for power generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships. Claims are frequently filed and or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had pending approximately 50,090 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 52,220 as of December 31, 2010 and 62,360 as of December 31, 2009. During 2011, the Company received approximately 4,410 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 6,540 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Companys total costs for the years 2011 and 2010 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $33 million and $14 million, respectively. The Companys costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year as insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses. Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non cancer claims. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Companys estimate of its asbestos liabilities. Other. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product II 35 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors. General. On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and or Viacom Inc. is named. Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows, generally within the next twelve months, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future television and film production costs as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non designated forward contracts to hedge non U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non designated contracts is included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2011, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $151 million which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows. At December 31, 2010, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $114 million, of which $2 million related to the hedging of future production costs and $112 million represented hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows. Interest Rate Risk All of the Companys long term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. During 2009, the Company entered into fixed to floating rate swap agreements for a portion of its debt, which were designated as fair value hedges. Gains or losses on interest rate swaps were recorded as a change in the carrying value of the debt attributable to the risk being hedged. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company settled all of its interest rate swaps outstanding. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding during 2011 or 2010. II 36 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Credit Risk The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. The Companys receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2011 or 2010, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Companys products and services are sold. Related Parties National Amusements, Inc. National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") is the controlling stockholder of CBS Corp. Mr. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, is the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and founder of both CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. In addition, Ms. Shari Redstone, Mr. Sumner M. Redstones daughter, is the president and a director of NAI and the vice chair of the board of directors of both CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. Mr. David R. Andelman is a director of CBS Corp. and serves as a director of NAI. Mr. Frederic V. Salerno is a director of CBS Corp. and serves as a director of Viacom Inc. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for additional information on the Companys relationship with NAI and Viacom Inc. At December 31, 2011, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 79% of CBS Corp.s voting Class A Common Stock and owned approximately 6% of CBS Corp.s Class A Common Stock and non voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. Viacom Inc. As part of its normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions with Viacom Inc. and its subsidiaries. Through its Entertainment segment, the Company licenses its television products to Viacom Inc., primarily MTV Networks and BET Networks. In addition, the Company recognizes revenues for advertising spending placed by various subsidiaries of Viacom Inc., primarily Paramount Pictures. Viacom Inc. also distributes certain of the Companys television products in the home entertainment market. The Companys total revenues from these transactions were $255 million, $262 million and $243 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company places advertisements with, and leases production facilities, licenses programming and purchases other goods and services from various subsidiaries of Viacom Inc. The total amounts for these transactions were $23 million, $27 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. II 37 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following table presents the amounts due from or due to Viacom Inc. in the normal course of business as reflected on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2011 2010 Amounts due from Viacom Inc. Receivables $ 102 $ 104 Other assets (Receivables, noncurrent) 198 252 Total amounts due from Viacom Inc. $ 300 $ 356 Amounts due to Viacom Inc. Accounts payable $ 3 $ 5 Program rights 2 4 Other liabilities (Program rights, noncurrent) 1 Total amounts due to Viacom Inc. $ 5 $ 10 Other Related Parties The Company has equity interests in a domestic television network and several international joint ventures for television channels, from which the Company earns revenues primarily by selling its television programming. Total revenues earned from these joint ventures were $133 million, $145 million and $132 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company, through the normal course of business, is involved in other transactions with related parties that have not been material in any of the periods presented. Adoption of New Accounting Standards Goodwill Impairment Testing During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company early adopted amended FASB guidance on goodwill impairment testing. Under this guidance, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If based on this assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary. Disclosures about an Employers Participation in a Multiemployer Plan During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance which requires separate disclosures about an employers participation in multiemployer pension plans and multiemployer other postretirement benefit plans as well as enhanced disclosures about multiemployer pension plans. Comprehensive Income During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company early adopted amended FASB guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. Under this guidance, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income must be presented either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. Upon adoption, the Company elected to present two separate consecutive statements. II 38 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued) (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables On January 1, 2011, the Company adopted revised FASB guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. This guidance revises the criteria for separating and allocating consideration for each deliverable in a multiple deliverable arrangement and establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of each deliverable. Under the guidance, revenues are allocated based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on the Company specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if Company specific evidence is not available, or estimated selling price for the stand alone sale of the deliverable if neither Company specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Recent Pronouncements Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which requires disclosure of both gross and net information about financial instruments and derivative instruments eligible for offset in the balance sheet as well as financial instruments and derivative instruments subject to a master netting arrangement regardless of whether they are offset. The adoption of this guidance, which is effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013, is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurement In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2012. This guidance clarifies the FASBs intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and changes certain principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
