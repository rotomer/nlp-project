Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our consolidated financial condition as of December 31, 2001 and our consolidated results of operations for each year in the three year period ended December 31, 2001. The statements in this discussion regarding the industry outlook, our expectations regarding the future performance of our businesses and the other nonhistorical statements in this discussion are forward looking statements. See " Cautionary Statement for Purposes of Forward Looking Statements". This discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. Results of operations of the acquired businesses and towers that are wholly and majority owned are included in our consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition. As such, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2000, and the results for the year ended December 31, 2000 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 1999. Overview The continued growth of our business depends substantially on the condition of the wireless communications and broadcast industries. We believe that the demand for communications sites will continue to 3 grow and expect that, due to increased competition, wireless carriers will continue to seek operating and capital efficiencies by (1) outsourcing certain network services and the build out and operation of new and existing infrastructure; and (2) planning to use a tower site as a common location, or "co locating", for the placement of their antennas and transmission equipment alongside the equipment of other communications providers. In addition, we believe that more wireless carriers will seek to sell their wireless communications infrastructure to, or establish joint ventures with, experienced infrastructure providers, such as the Company, that have the demonstrated ability to manage the assets. Further, we believe that wireless carriers and broadcasters will continue to seek to outsource the operation of their towers and may, eventually, outsource their transmission networks, including the transmission of their signals. Management believes that our ability to manage towers and transmission networks and our proven track record of providing services addressing all aspects of signaling systems from the originating station to the terminating receiver, or "end to end" services, to the wireless communications and broadcasting industries position our company to capture such business. The willingness of wireless carriers to utilize our infrastructure and related services is affected by numerous factors, including: . consumer demand for wireless services; . interest rates; . cost of capital; . availability of capital to wireless carriers; . tax policies; . willingness to co locate equipment; . local restrictions on the proliferation of towers; . cost of building towers; . technological changes affecting the number of communications sites needed to provide wireless communications services to a given geographic area; and . our ability to efficiently satisfy their service requirements. Our revenues that are derived from the provision of transmission services to the broadcasting industry will be affected by, among other things: . the timing of the rollout of digital television broadcasts from tower mounted antenna systems, or "digital terrestrial television broadcasts", principally in the United Kingdom; . consumer demand for digital terrestrial broadcasting; . interest rates; . cost of capital; . zoning restrictions on towers; and . the cost of building towers. As an important part of our business strategy, we will seek to: (1)maximize utilization of our tower capacity, (2) utilize the expertise of U.S., U.K. and Australian personnel to capture global growth opportunities, (3) partner with wireless carriers to assume ownership of their existing towers, and (4) build new towers for wireless carriers. 4 Critical Accounting Policies The following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Revenue Recognition Site rental and broadcast transmission revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the relevant lease, agreement or contract. These revenues are recognized on a straight line basis, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Some agreements provide for rent free periods at the beginning of the lease term, while others call for rent to be prepaid for some period. If the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is spread evenly over the term of the agreement. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue recognized in a given period represents cash collected in other periods. For 2001, the non cash portion of our site rental and broadcast transmission revenues amounted to approximately $23.6 million. Network services revenues are generally recognized under (1) the completed contract method or (2) the percentage of completion method. Under the completed contract method, revenues and costs for a particular project are recognized in total at the completion date. Under the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as incurred and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of contract costs incurred compared to the estimated total contract costs. The completed contract method is used for projects that require relatively short periods of time to complete (primarily antenna installations, which generally require three months or less). The percentage of completion method is used for projects that require longer periods to complete. When using the completed contract method of accounting for network services revenues, we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period. For antenna installations, we consider the project complete when the customer can begin transmitting its signal through the antenna. When using the percentage of completion method, we must be able to accurately estimate the total costs we expect to incur on a project in order to record the proper amount of revenues for the period. Under both methods, we must be able to estimate losses on uncompleted contracts, as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are known. We do not believe that our use of the completed contract method for short term projects produces operating results that differ substantially from the percentage of completion method. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable As part of our normal accounting procedures, we must evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected. This is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our customers ability and willingness to pay these accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance that we believe will be collected. In estimating the appropriate balance for this allowance, we consider (1) specific reserves for accounts we believe may prove to be uncollectible and (2) additional reserves, based on historical collections, for the remainder of our accounts. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to operating expenses, and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts should prove to be inaccurate at some future date, the results of operations for the period could be materially effected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Valuation of Long Lived Assets We review the carrying values of property and equipment and other long lived assets, including goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be 5 recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from the asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred will generally involve (1) a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or (3) a change in strategy affecting the utility of the asset. Our measurement of the fair value of an impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. On January 1, 2002, we will adopt the new accounting standard for goodwill and intangible assets (see " Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards"). In accordance with that new standard, we will review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. Deferred Income Taxes We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods. In order to compute these deferred tax balances, we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities (referred to as "temporary differences"). These temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities. If deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities, we must estimate whether those net deferred asset amounts will be realized in the future. A valuation allowance is then provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized. The change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our statement of operations. If our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate, the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods. Such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. Results of Operations Our primary sources of revenues are from: (1)renting antenna space on towers and rooftops sites, (2)providing analog and digital broadcast transmission services, and (3)providing network services, including the installation of antennas on our sites as well as third party sites. Site rental revenues in the U.S. are received primarily from wireless communications companies, including those operating in the following categories of wireless communications: . cellular; . personal communications services, a digital service operating at a higher frequency range than cellular; . microwave; . paging; . specialized mobile radio, a service operating in the frequency range used for two way radio communication by public safety, trucking companies, and other dispatch service users; and . enhanced specialized mobile radio, a service operating in the SMR frequency range using enhanced technology. 6 Site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease agreements, which typically have original terms of five years (with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each). Broadcast transmission services revenues in the U.K. are received for both analog and digital transmission services. Monthly analog transmission revenues are principally received from the BBC under a contract with an initial 10 year term through March 31, 2007. Digital transmission services revenues from the BBC and ITVdigital (formerly ONdigital) are recognized under contracts with initial terms of 12 years through November 15, 2010. Monthly revenues from these digital transmission contracts increase over time as the network rollout progresses. On March 27, 2002, a U.K. court approved an application by ITVdigital to be placed into administration (a proceeding, similar to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in the United States, designed to protect the applicant from the claims of its creditors while it reorganizes its business). There can be no assurances as to the outcome of this action or its effect on us. ITVdigital accounted for approximately $30.7 million, or 3.4%, of our revenues for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2001. The loss of ITVdigital as a customer or the modification of the ITVdigital transmission contract could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. See "Item 1. Business U.K. Operations Significant Contracts". Site rental revenues in the U.K. are received from other broadcast transmission service providers (primarily NTL) and wireless communications companies, including all four U.K. cellular operators (BT Cellnet, Vodafone, One 2 One and Orange). Site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease agreements with original terms of three to 12 years. Such lease agreements generally require annual payments in advance, and include rental rate adjustment provisions between one and three years from the commencement of the lease. Site rental revenues are expected to become an increasing portion of CCUKs total U.K. revenue base, and we believe that the demand for site rental from communication service providers will increase in line with the expected growth of these communication services in the United Kingdom. Network services revenues in the U.S. consist of revenues from: (1)antenna installation, (2)site acquisition, (3)site development and construction, (4)network design and site selection, and (5)other services. Network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies. Network services revenues in the U.S. are recognized under service contracts which provide for billings on either a fixed price basis or a time and materials basis. Demand for our network services fluctuates from period to period and within periods. See "Item 1. Business Risk Factors Variability in Demand for Network Services May Reduce the Predictability of Our Results". Consequently, the operating results of our network services businesses for any particular period may vary significantly, and should not be considered as indicative of longer term results. We also derive revenues from the ownership and operation of microwave radio and specialized mobile radio networks in Puerto Rico where we own radio wave spectrum in the 2,000 MHz and 6,000 MHz range (for microwave radio) and the 800 MHz range (for specialized mobile radio). These revenues are generally recognized under monthly management or service agreements. Network services revenues in the U.K. consist of (1) network design and site selection, site acquisition, site development and antenna installation and (2) site management and other services. Network design and development and related services are provided to: (1)a number of broadcasting and related organizations, both in the United Kingdom and other countries, (2)all four U.K. cellular operators, and (3)Hutchison as part of their deployment of 3G sevices in the U.K. 7 These services are often subject to a competitive bid, and a significant proportion result from an operator coming onto an existing CCUK site. Revenues from such services are recognized on either a fixed price or a time and materials basis. Site management and other services, consisting of both network monitoring and equipment maintenance, are carried out in the United Kingdom for a number of emergency service organizations. CCUK receives revenues for such services under contracts with original terms of between three and five years. Such contracts provide fixed prices for network monitoring and variable pricing dependent on the level of equipment maintenance carried out in a given period. Costs of operations for site rental in the U.S. primarily consist of: . land leases; . repairs and maintenance; . employee compensation and related benefits costs; . utilities; . insurance; . property taxes; . monitoring costs; and . in the case of our few managed sites, rental payments. For any given tower, such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as additional customers are added. However, rental expenses at certain managed sites increase as additional customer antennas are added, resulting in higher incremental revenues but lower incremental margins than on owned towers. Costs of operations for broadcast transmission services in the U.K. consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs, utilities, rental payments under the Site Sharing Agreement with NTL, circuit costs and repairs and maintenance on both transmission equipment and structures. Site rental operating costs in the U.K. consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs, utilities and repairs, maintenance and leases of land or rooftop sites. With the exception of land and rooftop leases, the majority of such costs are relatively fixed in nature, with increases in revenue from new installations on existing sites generally being achieved without a corresponding increase in costs. Generally, leases of land and rooftop sites have a revenue sharing component that averages 20% to 30% of additional revenues added from subsequent tenants. Costs of operations for network services consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs, subcontractor services, consulting fees, and other on site construction and materials costs. We incur these network services costs (1) to support our internal operations, including maintenance of our owned towers, and (2) to maintain the employees necessary to provide end to end services to third parties regardless of the level of such business at any time. We believe that our experienced staff enables us to provide the type of end to end services that enhance our ability to attract wireless service providers to our sites. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: . employee compensation, training, recruitment and related benefits costs; . advertising; . professional and consulting fees; . office rent and related expenses; and . travel costs. 8 Corporate development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and development of new business initiatives. These expenses consist primarily of: . allocated compensation and external professional fees; . benefits; and . overhead costs that are not directly related to the administration or management of existing towers. Depreciation and amortization charges relate to our property and equipment (which consists primarily of towers, broadcast transmission equipment, associated buildings, construction equipment and vehicles), goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with business acquisitions. Depreciation of towers, depreciation of broadcast transmission equipment and amortization of goodwill are computed with a useful life of 20 years. Amortization of other intangible assets (principally the value of existing site rental contracts at Crown Communication) is computed with a useful life of 10 years. Depreciation of buildings is computed with useful lives ranging from 20 to 50 years. Depreciation of construction equipment and vehicles is generally computed with useful lives of 10 years and 5 years, respectively. In March 1999, we completed the formation of Crown Atlantic, our joint venture with Bell Atlantic Mobile. In June and December of 1999, we completed the acquisition of towers from Powertel. During 1999, 2000 and 2001 we completed the transactions with BellSouth and BellSouth DCS. In 2000, we completed the transaction with GTE. Additionally, during 2000 Crown Atlantic acquired the Frontier towers from Bell Atlantic Mobile, and CCAL completed the substantial portion of the transaction with Cable & Wireless Optus. Results of operations of these acquired businesses and towers are included in our consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition. As such, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2000, and the results for the year ended December 31, 2000 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 1999. 9 The following information is derived from our historical Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated.

The increases in network services and other revenues reflect continued demand for antenna installation from our tenants along with increased third party service work. 12 Costs of operations for 2001 were $467.2 million, an increase of $152.6 million from 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1)a $44.3 million increase in site rental and broadcast transmission costs, of which $8.7 million was attributable to CCUK, $5.7 million was attributable to Crown Atlantic, $3.6 million was attributable to CCAL and $26.3 million was attributable to CCUSA, (2)a $94.4 million increase in network services costs related to CCUSA, (3)a $9.2 million increase in network services costs from CCUK, (4)a $3.8 million increase in network services costs from Crown Atlantic, and (5)$1.0 million in network services costs from CCAL. Costs of operations for site rental and broadcast transmission as a percentage of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues decreased to 41.5% for 2001 from 43.6% for 2000 because of higher margins attributable to incremental revenues from the Crown Atlantic, CCAL and CCUSA operations. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues increased to 70.7% for 2001 from 59.2% for 2000 because of lower margins from the CCUSA, CCUK and Crown Atlantic operations. Network services revenues for 2001 included a greater proportion of third party service work than in 2000, and third party services typically produce lower margins than tenant antenna installation services. General and administrative expenses for 2001 were $102.5 million, an increase of $25.6 million from 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1)an $11.4 million increase in expenses related to the CCUSA operations, (2)a $9.4 million increase in expenses at our corporate office, (3)a $3.3 million increase in expenses at CCUK, and (4)a $1.8 million increase in expenses at CCAL, partially offset by (5)a $0.3 million decrease in expenses at Crown Atlantic. The increases in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from higher staffing levels to support the growth of our business. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for 2001 to 11.4% from 11.8% for 2000 because of lower overhead costs as a percentage of revenues for CCUSA, CCAL and Crown Atlantic. Corporate development expenses for 2001 were $12.3 million, compared to $10.5 million for 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses at our corporate office. For 2001, we recorded non recurring cash charges of $19.4 million in connection with a restructuring of our business announced in July 2001. Such charges related to employee severance payments and costs of office closures. In addition, we announced in March 2002 that we plan to record a non recurring restructuring charge estimated to be between approximately $7.0 million and $13.0 million with respect to staff redundancies and the disposition of certain service lines in connection with our U.K. operations. We expect the charge to be reflected in our results of operations for 2002. See " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges". For 2001, we recorded asset write down charges of $24.9 million in connection with the restructuring of our business announced in July 2001. Such non cash charges related to write downs of certain inventories, property and equipment, and other assets. We are also undertaking a review of our construction in process, which may result in certain open projects being abandoned in 2002. A non cash charge would be recorded in 2002 for the write down of any such abandoned projects. The total amount of construction in process being reviewed is approximately $38 million. See " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges". For 2001, we recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges of $6.1 million related to the issuance of stock and stock options to certain employees and executives, compared to $3.1 million for 2000. See " Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions". 13 Depreciation and amortization for 2001 was $328.5 million, an increase of $89.7 million from 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1)a $16.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the property and equipment and goodwill from CCUK, (2)a $10.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the property and equipment and goodwill from Crown Atlantic, (3)a $5.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to property and equipment from CCAL, and (4)a $56.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets related to the CCUSA operations. Interest and other income (expense) for 2001 resulted primarily from: (1)the investment of the net proceeds from our recent offerings (see " Liquidity and Capital Resources"), offset by (2)costs incurred in connection with unsuccessful acquisition attempts and (3)our share of losses incurred by unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2001 was $297.4 million, an increase of $56.2 million, or 23.3%, from 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to interest on indebtedness at CCUSA, CCUK and Crown Atlantic, and interest on the 10 3/4% senior notes and the 9 3/8% senior notes. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources". The provision for income taxes of $16.5 million for 2001 consists primarily of a non cash deferred tax liability recognized by CCUK. CCUKs deferred tax liability resulted from an excess of basis differences for its property and equipment over its available tax net operating losses. Minority interests represent the minority partners 43.1% interest in Crown Atlantics operations, the minority partners 17.8% interest in the operations of the GTE joint venture and the minority shareholders 22.4% interest in the CCAL operations. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 Operating Segments CCUSA. CCUSAs revenues for 2000 were $329.2 million, an increase of $226.5 million from 1999. This increase was attributable to a $125.2 million, or 214.7%, increase in site rental revenues and a $101.3 million increase in network services and other revenues. Costs of operations for 2000 were $159.8 million, an increase of $118.2 million from 1999. This increase was attributable to a $56.1 million increase in site rental costs and a $62.1 million increase in network services costs. Costs of operations for site rental as a percentage of site rental revenues increased to 41.9% for 2000 from 35.5% for 1999.

CCUKs revenues for 2000 were $217.7 million, an increase of $24.0 million from 1999. This increase was attributable to a $20.2 million, or 11.8%, increase in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues and a $3.8 million increase in network services and other revenues. Costs of operations for 2000 were $106.4 14 million, an increase of $13.4 million from 1999. This increase was attributable to a $10.4 million increase in site rental and broadcast transmission costs and a $3.0 million increase in network services costs. Costs of operations for site rental and broadcast transmission as a percentage of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues increased to 45.7% for 2000 from 45.0% for 1999.

For 2000, CCUK recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges of $1.0 million, compared to $0.8 million for 1999 (see " Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions"). Depreciation and amortization for 2000 was $77.2 million, an increase of $13.6 million from 1999. Interest and other income (expense) for 2000 was $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million from 1999. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2000 was $32.0 million, an increase of $3.6 million from 1999. Crown Atlantic. Crown Atlantics revenues for 2000 were $95.5 million, an increase of $47.6 million from 1999. This increase was attributable to a $25.9 million, or 68.9%, increase in site rental revenues and a $21.7 million increase in network services and other revenues. Costs of operations for 2000 were $44.7 million, an increase of $23.7 million from 1999. This increase was attributable to a $9.9 million increase in site rental costs and a $13.8 million increase in network services costs. Costs of operations for site rental as a percentage of site rental revenues decreased to 41.3% for 2000 from 43.3% for 1999. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues increased to 57.8% for 2000 from 45.3% for 1999.

General and administrative expenses for 2000 were $6.3 million, an increase of $1.2 million from 1999. Corporate development expenses for 2000 were $9.7 million, compared to $4.6 million for 1999. For 2000 and 1999, the corporate office recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges of $1.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively (see " Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions"). Depreciation and amortization for 2000 was $1.3 million, an increase of $0.1 million from 1999. Interest and other income (expense) for 2000 was $28.2 million, an increase of $15.2 million from 1999. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2000 was $148.3 million, an increase of $82.1 million from 1999. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 Consolidated Consolidated revenues for 2000 were $649.2 million, an increase of $303.4 million from 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1)a $178.1 million, or 66.5%, increase in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues, of which $20.2 million was attributable to CCUK, $25.9 million was attributable to Crown Atlantic, $6.8 million was attributable to CCAL and $125.2 million was attributable to CCUSA, (2)a $101.3 million increase in network services and other revenues from CCUSA, (3)a $3.8 million increase in network services and other revenues from CCUK, and (4)a $21.7 million increase in network services and other revenues from Crown Atlantic. Costs of operations for 2000 were $314.6 million, an increase of $157.9 million from 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1)an $80.0 million increase in site rental and broadcast transmission costs, of which $10.4 million was attributable to CCUK, $9.9 million was attributable to Crown Atlantic, $3.6 million was attributable to CCAL and $56.1 million was attributable to CCUSA, 15 (2)a $62.1 million increase in network services costs related to CCUSA, (3)a $3.0 million increase in network services costs from CCUK, and (4)a $13.8 million increase in network services costs from Crown Atlantic. Costs of operations for site rental and broadcast transmission as a percentage of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues increased to 43.6% for 2000 from 42.7% for 1999 because of lower margins attributable to the CCUK, CCAL and CCUSA operations. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues increased to 59.2% for 2000 from 54.3% for 1999, primarily due to lower margins from the CCUSA, CCUK and Crown Atlantic operations. General and administrative expenses for 2000 were $76.9 million, an increase of $33.1 million from 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1)a $21.7 million increase in expenses related to the CCUSA operations, (2)a $1.2 million increase in expenses at our corporate office, (3)a $3.3 million increase in expenses at Crown Atlantic, (4)a $2.4 million increase in expenses at CCUK, and (5)$4.4 million in expenses at CCAL. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for 2000 to 11.8% from 12.7% for 1999 because of lower overhead costs as a percentage of revenues for CCUSA and Crown Atlantic. Corporate development expenses for 2000 were $10.5 million, compared to $5.4 million for 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses at our corporate office. For 2000, we recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges of $3.1 million related to the issuance of stock and stock options to certain employees and executives, compared to $2.2 million for 1999. See " Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions". Depreciation and amortization for 2000 was $238.8 million, an increase of $108.7 million from 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1)a $13.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the property and equipment and goodwill from CCUK, (2)a $9.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the property and equipment and goodwill from Crown Atlantic, (3)$5.2 million of depreciation and amortization related to property and equipment from CCAL, and (4)an $80.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets related to the CCUSA operations. Interest and other income (expense) for 2000 resulted primarily from: (1)the investment of the net proceeds from our recent offerings (see " Liquidity and Capital Resources") and (2)a gain recognized upon the disposition of an investment in an affiliate, partially offset by (3) costs incurred in connection with unsuccessful acquisition attempts. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2000 was $241.3 million, an increase of $130.4 million, or 117.6%, from 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to interest on indebtedness at CCUSA, CCUK and Crown Atlantic, amortization of the original issue discount on the 10 3/8% discount notes and the 11 1/4% discount notes, interest on the 9% senior notes, the 9 1/2% senior notes and the 10 3/4% senior notes, and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the term loans. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources". 16 Minority interests represent the minority shareholders 20% interest in CCUKs operations (prior to July 2000), the minority partners 43.1% interest in Crown Atlantics operations, the minority partners 18.0% interest in the operations of the GTE joint venture and the minority shareholders 33.3% interest in the CCAL operations. The extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2000 represents the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the senior credit facility. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources". Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business strategy contemplates substantial capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our tower portfolios by pursuing build to suit opportunities in the markets in which we currently operate. Since its inception, CCIC has generally funded its activities, other than acquisitions and investments, through excess proceeds from contributions of equity capital and cash provided by operations. CCIC has financed acquisitions and investments with the proceeds from equity contributions, borrowings under our senior credit facilities and issuances of debt securities. Since its inception, CCUK has generally funded its activities, other than the acquisition of the BBC home service transmission business, through cash provided by operations and borrowings under CCUKs credit facility. CCUK financed the acquisition of the BBC home service transmission business with the proceeds from equity contributions and the issuance of the CCUK bonds. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, our net cash provided by operating activities was $92.6 million, $165.5 million and $131.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, our net cash provided by financing activities was $1,670.4 million, $1,707.1 million and $1,109.3 million, respectively. Our primary financing related activities in 2001 included the following: January 2001 Offering In January 2001, we sold 13,445,200 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering. The shares were sold to the public at a price of $26.25 per share and we received proceeds of $342.9 million (after underwriting discounts of $10.1 million). The proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes. Crown Atlantic Credit Facility In March 2001, the Crown Atlantic credit facility was amended to increase the available borrowings to $345.0 million. Under the amended facility, the amount of available borrowings will begin to decrease on March 31, 2003. May 2001 Debt Offering On May 10, 2001, we issued $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes for proceeds of $441.0 million (after underwriting discounts of $9.0 million). The proceeds from the sale of these securities will be used to fund the initial interest payments on the 9 3/8% senior notes and for general corporate purposes. Capital expenditures were $683.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, of which $3.8 million were for CCIC, $363.8 million were for CCUSA, $94.2 million were for Crown Atlantic, $219.0 million were for CCUK and $2.3 million were for CCAL. We anticipate that we will build, through the end of 2002, approximately 450 to 550 towers in the United States at a cost of approximately $135 million and approximately 450 to 550 towers in the United Kingdom at a cost of approximately $50 million. In addition, we are obligated to pay a site access fee to British Telecom in the amount of (Pounds)100.0 million ($145.4 million). We are currently in discussions regarding the deferral of a portion of this payment, but there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. We also expect to spend approximately $125 million in the United States for tower 17 improvements, including enhancements to the structural capacity of our domestic towers in order to support the anticipated leasing. In April 2001, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of 49% of the outstanding capital stock of RaiWay S.p.A. ("RaiWay"). RaiWay is a subsidiary of RAI Radio Televisione Italiana S.p.A. ("RAI"), the Italian state owned television and radio broadcaster. RaiWay manages over 2,300 broadcast transmission sites across Italy. The cost of our investment in RaiWay amounted to approximately $383.8 million in cash, and such amount was deposited into a Euro denominated escrow account upon execution of the Share Purchase Agreement. The transaction was subject to approval by the Italian regulatory authorities and, in October 2001, we were notified that the Italian Minister of Communication had declined to approve the transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the escrow deposit was returned to us in November 2001. We expect that the execution of our new tower build, or build to suit program, will have a material impact on our liquidity. We expect that once integrated, these new towers will have a positive impact on liquidity, but will require some period of time to offset the initial adverse impact on liquidity. In addition, we believe that as new towers become operational and we begin to add tenants, they should result in a long term increase in liquidity. To fund the execution of our business strategy, including the construction of new towers, we expect to use the net proceeds of our recent offerings and cash provided by operations. We do not currently expect to utilize further borrowings available under our U.S. and U.K. credit facilities in any significant amounts. We will have additional cash needs to fund our operations in the future. We may also have additional cash needs in the future if additional tower acquisitions or build to suit opportunities arise. If we do not otherwise have cash available, or borrowings under our credit facilities have otherwise been utilized, when our cash need arises, we would be forced to seek additional debt or equity financing or to forego the opportunity. In the event we determine to seek additional debt or equity financing, there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available, on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or permitted by the terms of our existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2001, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $804.6 million (including $5.9 million at CCUSA, $169.0 million at CCUK, $13.1 million at Crown Atlantic, $15.0 million at CCAL, $389.5 million in an unrestricted investment subsidiary and $212.1 million at CCIC and a restricted investment subsidiary), consolidated liquid investments (consisting of marketable securities) of $201.5 million, consolidated long term debt of $3,423.1 million, consolidated redeemable preferred stock of $878.9 million and consolidated stockholders equity of $2,364.6 million. As of March 15, 2002, Crown Atlantic had unused borrowing availability under its amended credit facility of approximately $45.0 million, and CCUK had unused borrowing availability under its credit facility of approximately (Pounds)30.0 million ($43.6 million). As of March 15, 2002, our restricted U.S. and Australian subsidiaries had approximately $500.0 million of unused borrowing availability under the 2000 credit facility. Our various credit facilities require our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial covenants and place restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt and liens, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, undertake transactions with affiliates and make investments. These facilities also limit the ability of the borrowing subsidiaries to pay dividends to CCIC. The primary factors that determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with their debt covenants are (1) their current financial performance (based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or "EBITDA"), (2) their levels of indebtedness and (3) their debt service requirements. Since we do not currently expect that our subsidiaries will need to utilize significant additional borrowings under their credit facilities, the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would result from a deterioration of a subsidiarys EBITDA performance. In addition, certain of the credit facilities will require that EBITDA increase in future years as covenant calculations become more restrictive. Should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in EBITDA performance (or for any other reason), we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long 18 as the covenant violation continues. Any such early principal payments would have to be made from our existing cash balances. If we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements, including interest payments on the notes, in the future. Our 9% senior notes, our 9 1/2% senior notes, our 10 3/4% senior notes and our 9 3/8% senior notes require annual cash interest payments of approximately $16.2 million, $11.9 million, $53.8 million and $42.2 million, respectively. Prior to November 15, 2002, May 15, 2004 and August 1, 2004, the interest expense on our 10 5/8% discount notes, our 10 3/8% discount notes and our 11 1/4% discount notes, respectively, will be comprised solely of the amortization of original issue discount. Thereafter, the 10 5/8% discount notes, the 10 3/8% discount notes and the 11 1/4% discount notes will require annual cash interest payments of approximately $26.7 million, $51.9 million and $29.3 million, respectively. Prior to December 15, 2003, we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our 12 3/4% exchangeable preferred stock or, if issued, cash interest on the exchange debentures. Thereafter, assuming all dividends or interest have been paid in kind, our exchangeable preferred stock or, if issued, the exchange debentures will require annual cash dividend or interest payments of approximately $47.8 million. Annual cash interest payments on the CCUK bonds are (Pounds)11.25 million ($16.4 million). In addition, our various credit facilities will require periodic interest payments on amounts borrowed thereunder, which amounts could be substantial. As a holding company, CCIC will require distributions or dividends from its subsidiaries, or will be forced to use capital raised in debt and equity offerings, to fund its debt obligations, including interest payments on the cash pay notes and eventually the 10 5/8% discount notes, the 10 3/8% discount notes and the 11 1/4% discount notes. The terms of the indebtedness of our subsidiaries significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to CCIC. As a result, we will be required to apply a portion of the net proceeds from the recent debt offerings to fund interest payments on the cash pay notes. If we do not retain sufficient funds from the offerings or any future financing, we may not be able to make our interest payments on the cash pay notes. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2001: Years Ending December 31, 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Totals (in thousands of dollars) Long term debt................................ $ 29,086 $ 43,336 $134,711 $200,336 $282,081 $2,930,288 $3,619,838 Interest payments on long term debt (a)....... 197,373 222,347 242,098 289,116 275,923 1,058,880 2,285,737 Capital lease obligations..................... 4,139 2,587 1,173 25 26 15 7,965 Operating lease obligations................... 118,372 103,836 95,364 87,091 76,078 393,372 874,113 Site access fee to British Telecom, secured by letter of credit(b).......................... 145,430 145,430 Redeemable preferred stock.................... 977,103 977,103 Dividend payments on exchangeable preferred stock........................................ 47,762 47,762 47,762 191,048 334,334 $494,400 $372,106 $521,108 $624,330 $681,870 $5,550,706 $8,244,520 (a)Interest payments on floating rate debt are estimated based on rates in effect during the first quarter of 2002. (b)We are currently in discussions regarding the deferral of a portion of this payment. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of these discussions. Our joint venture agreements with Bell Atlantic Mobile and GTE (both now part of Verizon Communications) provide that, upon dissolution of either venture, Verizon Communications will receive (1) the shares of our common stock contributed to the venture and (2) a payment equal to a percentage of the fair market value (at the dissolution date) of the ventures other net assets. As of December 31, 2001, such percentages would be approximately 24.1% for the Bell Atlantic Mobile venture and 11.0% for the GTE venture. The 24.1% payment for the Bell Atlantic Mobile venture could be paid either in cash or shares of our common stock, at our election. The 11.0% payment for the GTE venture could only be paid in cash. A dissolution of either venture may be triggered (1) by Verizon Communications at any time following the third anniversary of the formation of the 19 applicable venture and (2) by us at any time following the fourth anniversary of such ventures formation (subject to certain penalties if prior to the seventh anniversary). Our joint venture with Bell Atlantic Mobile was formed on March 31, 1999, and our joint venture with GTE was formed on January 31, 2000. See "Item 1. Business The Company Overview". Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of, or to pay interest on, our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations, will depend on our future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to refinance any indebtedness in the future would depend in part on our maintaining adequate credit ratings from the commercial rating agencies. Such credit ratings are dependent on all the liquidity and performance factors discussed above, as well as general expectations that the rating agencies have regarding the outlook for our business and our industry. We anticipate that we may need to refinance a substantial portion of our indebtedness on or prior to its scheduled maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effect any required refinancings of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. See "Item 1. Business Risk Factors". Reporting Requirements Under the Indentures Governing the Companys Debt Securities (the "Indentures") and the Certificate of Designations Governing the Companys 12 3/4% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the "Certificate") The following information (as such capitalized terms are defined in the Indentures and the Certificate) is presented solely as a requirement of the Indentures and the Certificate; such information is not intended as an alternative measure of financial position, operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles).

For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, the GTE joint venture had revenues from Verizon Communications of $46.2 million and $61.8 million, respectively. Verizon Communications is our joint venture partner in both of these ventures. Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges In July 2001, we announced a restructuring of our business in order to increase operational efficiency and better align costs with anticipated revenues. As part of the restructuring, we reduced our global staff by approximately 312 full time employees, closed five offices in the United States and closed our development 21 offices in Brazil and Europe. The actions taken for the restructuring were substantially completed as of the end of 2001. In connection with the restructuring, we recorded non recurring cash charges of approximately $19.4 million during 2001 related to employee severance payments ($13.9 million) and costs of office closures ($5.5 million). We have recorded asset write down charges of $24.9 million during 2001 in connection with the restructuring of our business announced in July 2001. Such non cash charges related to the write down of certain inventories ($11.9 million), property and equipment ($8.5 million), and other assets ($4.5 million) that were deemed to have no value as a result of the restructuring. In March 2002, we announced that we plan to record a non recurring restructuring charge estimated to be between approximately $7.0 million and $13.0 million with respect to staff redundancies and the disposition of certain service lines in connection with our U.K. operations. We expect the charge to be reflected in our results of operations for 2002. We are also undertaking a review of our construction in process, which may result in certain open projects being abandoned in 2002. A non cash charge would be recorded in 2002 for the write down of any such abandoned projects. The total amount of construction in process being reviewed is approximately $38 million. Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions We are recognizing non cash general and administrative compensation charges related to certain stock options granted to employees and executives prior to our IPO. Such charges amount to approximately $1.4 million per year, and will be recognized through the second quarter of 2003. In July 2000, we issued (1) 199,473 shares of our common stock and (2) options to purchase 17,577 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $.01 per share in connection with an acquisition by CCUK. Such shares and options were deemed to be compensation to the former shareholders of the acquired company (who remained employed by the Company). As a result, CCUK will recognize non cash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately $8.4 million over five years. In September 2000, we issued 336,600 shares of our common stock in connection with an acquisition by CCUSA. Of such shares, 170,710 were deemed to be compensation to the former shareholders of the acquired company (who remained employed by the Company). As a result, CCUSA will recognize non cash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately $5.9 million over four years. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations ("SFAS 141"), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 141 prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations, and requires that the purchase method be used for all business combinations after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also changes the manner in which acquired intangible assets are identified and recognized apart from goodwill. Further, SFAS 141 requires additional disclosures regarding the reasons for business combinations, the allocation of the purchase price to recognized assets and liabilities and the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets. We have used the purchase method of accounting since our inception, so the adoption of SFAS 141 will not change our method of accounting for business combinations. We will adopt the other recognition and disclosure requirements of SFAS 141 for any future business combinations. The transition provisions of SFAS 141 require that the carrying amounts for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in prior purchase method business combinations be reviewed and reclassified in accordance with the new recognition rules; such reclassifications are to be made in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 142. We will apply these transition provisions of SFAS 141 as of January 1, 2002, and do not believe that they will have any effect on our consolidated financial statements. 22 SFAS 142 changes the accounting and disclosure requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. The most significant provision of SFAS 142 is that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but rather will be tested for impairment on an annual basis. This annual impairment test will involve (1) a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values, and (2) a step to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over such lives, and tested for impairment in accordance with our existing policies. SFAS 142 requires disclosures about goodwill and other intangible assets in the periods subsequent to their acquisition, including (1) changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, in total and by operating segment, (2) the carrying amounts of intangible assets subject to amortization and those which are not subject to amortization, (3) information about impairment losses recognized, and (4) the estimated amount of intangible asset amortization expense for the next five years. The provisions of SFAS 142 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We will adopt the requirements of SFAS 142 as of January 1, 2002. In addition, the nonamortization provisions of SFAS 142 are to be immediately applied for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations subsequent to June 30, 2001. SFAS 142 requires that transitional impairment tests be performed at its adoption, and provides that resulting impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible assets be reported as the effect of a change in accounting principle. We have not yet completed our transitional impairment tests but, based on preliminary results of those tests, do not currently believe that an impairment loss for goodwill and other intangible assets will be recorded upon the adoption of SFAS 142. We expect that our depreciation and amortization expense will decrease by approximately $62.1 million per year as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142. In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 144 supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of ("SFAS 121"), but retains many of its fundamental provisions. SFAS 144 also clarifies certain measurement and classification issues from SFAS 121. In addition, SFAS 144 supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a business segment as found in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions ("APB 30"). However, SFAS 144 retains the requirement in APB 30 to separately report discontinued operations, and broadens the scope of such requirement to include more types of disposal transactions. The scope of SFAS 144 excludes goodwill and other intangible assets that are not to be amortized, as the accounting for such items is prescribed by SFAS 142. The provisions of SFAS 144 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and are to be applied prospectively. We will adopt the requirements of SFAS 144 as of January 1, 2002.
