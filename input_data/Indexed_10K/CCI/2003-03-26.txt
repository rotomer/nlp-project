Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our consolidated financial condition as of December 31, 2002 and our consolidated results of operations for each year in the three year period ended December 31, 2002. The statements in this discussion regarding the industry outlook, our expectations regarding the future performance of our businesses and the other nonhistorical statements in this discussion are forward looking statements. See " Cautionary Statement for Purposes of Forward Looking Statements". This discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document. Results of operations of the acquired businesses and towers that are wholly and majority owned are included in our consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition. As such, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2000. Overview The growth of our business depends substantially on the condition of the wireless communications and broadcast industries. We believe that the demand for new communications sites will continue, although possibly not at the levels experienced in prior years. The level of demand for new sites declined in 2002 as compared to 2001, as evidenced by a decrease of approximately 40% in the number of new tenants we were able to add to our sites. We also expect that, due to increased competition, wireless carriers will continue to seek operating and capital efficiencies by (1) outsourcing certain network services and the build out and operation of new and existing infrastructure; and (2) planning to use a tower site as a common location for the placement of their antennas and transmission equipment alongside the equipment of other communications providers. Further, we believe that wireless carriers and broadcasters will continue to seek to outsource the operation of their towers and may, eventually, outsource all or part of their transmission networks, including the transmission of their signals. Management believes that our ability to (1) manage towers and transmission networks and (2) provide services addressing most aspects of signaling systems, from the originating station to the terminating receiver, to the wireless communications and broadcasting industries position us to capture such business. The willingness of wireless carriers to utilize our infrastructure and related services is affected by numerous factors, including: . consumer demand for wireless services; . availability and location of our sites and alternative sites; . cost of capital, including interest rates; . availability of capital to wireless carriers; 35 . willingness to co locate equipment; . local restrictions on the proliferation of towers; . cost of building towers; . technological changes affecting the number of communications sites needed to provide wireless communications services to a given geographic area; . our ability to efficiently satisfy their service requirements; and . tax policies. Our revenues that are derived from the provision of transmission services to the broadcasting industry will be affected by, among other things: . consumer demand for digital television broadcasts from tower mounted antenna systems, or "digital terrestrial television broadcasts", principally in the United Kingdom; . cost of capital, including interest rates; . zoning restrictions on towers; and . the cost of building towers. As an important part of our business strategy, we will seek to: (1) maximize utilization of our tower capacity to grow revenues organically, (2) grow our margins by taking advantage of the relatively fixed nature of the operating costs associated with our site rental business, (3) allocate capital efficiently as we selectively build new towers for wireless carriers, acquire other assets or repurchase our own securities, and (4) utilize the expertise of U.S., U.K. (including our broadcast transmission expertise) and Australian personnel to extend revenues around our existing assets. Critical Accounting Policies The following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Revenue Recognition Site rental and broadcast transmission revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the relevant lease, agreement or contract. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, these revenues are recognized on a straight line basis, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Some agreements provide for rent free periods at the beginning of the lease term, while others call for rent to be prepaid for some period. If the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is spread evenly over the term of the agreement. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue recognized in a given period represents cash collected in other periods. For 2001 and 2002, the non cash portion of our site rental and broadcast transmission revenues amounted to approximately $23.6 million and $26.4 million, respectively. Network services revenues are generally recognized under the completed contract method. Under the completed contract method, revenues and costs for a particular project are recognized in total at the completion 36 date. When using the completed contract method of accounting for network services revenues, we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period. For antenna installations, we consider the project complete when the customer can begin transmitting its signal through the antenna. We must also be able to estimate losses on uncompleted contracts, as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are known. The completed contract method is used for projects that require relatively short periods of time to complete (generally less than one year). We do not believe that our use of the completed contract method for network services projects produces operating results that differ substantially from the percentage of completion method. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable As part of our normal accounting procedures, we must evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected. This is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our customers ability and willingness to pay these accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance that we believe will be collected. In estimating the appropriate balance for this allowance, we consider (1) specific reserves for accounts we believe may prove to be uncollectible and (2) additional reserves, based on historical collections, for the remainder of our accounts. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to operating expenses, and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts should prove to be inaccurate at some future date, the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Valuation of Long Lived Assets We review the carrying values of property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from the asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred will generally involve (1) a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or (3) a change in strategy affecting the utility of the asset. Our measurement of the fair value of an impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. On January 1, 2002, we adopted the new accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets. In accordance with that new standard, we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. This annual impairment test involves (1) a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values, and (2) a step to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we performed our annual update of the impairment test for goodwill. The results of this test indicate that goodwill is not impaired at any of our reporting units. However, the amount by which the estimated fair value for CCUSA exceeds its carrying value has declined since January 1, 2002. This decline is a function of our reduced forecasts for site leasing and antenna installation revenues, as indicated by our operating results for 2002. Further declines in our site leasing and network services business at CCUSA could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. Furthermore, if an impairment at CCUSA were to occur in the future, we believe that the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the write off of substantially all of CCUSAs goodwill ($164.0 million). Due to the continued weakness in the telecommunications industry, we intend to closely monitor the performance of our reporting units in 2003 in order to assess whether a goodwill impairment is indicated. 37 Deferred Income Taxes We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods. In order to compute these deferred tax balances, we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities (referred to as "temporary differences"). These temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities. If deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities, we must estimate whether those net deferred asset amounts will be realized in the future. A valuation allowance is then provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized. The change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our statement of operations. If our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate, the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods. Such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. Results of Operations Our primary sources of revenues are from: (1) renting antenna space on towers and rooftops sites, (2) providing analog and digital broadcast transmission services, and (3) providing network services, including the installation of antennas on our sites as well as third party sites. Site rental revenues in the U.S. are received primarily from wireless communications companies, including those operating in the following categories of wireless communications: . cellular; . personal communications services ("PCS"), a digital service operating at a higher frequency range than cellular; . enhanced specialized mobile radio ("ESMR"), a service operating in the SMR frequency range using enhanced technology; . wireless data services; . microwave; . paging; and . specialized mobile radio ("SMR"), a service operating in the frequency range used for two way radio communication by public safety, trucking companies, and other dispatch service users. Site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease agreements, which typically have original terms of five to ten years (with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each). Broadcast transmission services revenues in the U.K. are received for both analog and digital transmission services. Monthly analog transmission revenues are principally received from the BBC under a contract with an initial 10 year term through March 31, 2007. Digital transmission services revenues from the BBC are recognized under a contract with an initial term of 12 years through November 15, 2010. Monthly revenues from this digital transmission contract increase over time as the network rollout progresses. In addition, in connection with the launch of Freeview, we receive digital transmission services revenues from the BBC, BSkyB and other TV content providers under contracts with initial terms of six years. See "Item 1. Business The Company U.K. Operations". 38 Site rental revenues in the U.K. are received from other broadcast transmission service providers (primarily NTL) and wireless communications companies, including the U.K. cellular operators. Site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease agreements with original terms of three to 12 years. Such lease agreements generally require annual payments in advance, and include rental rate adjustment provisions between one and three years from the commencement of the lease. CCUK is a party to two agreements that contemplate a minimum level of site leasing and contain certain "take or pay" commitments by the carriers. In each case, the carrier is not leasing the number of sites within the time period contemplated by the agreement. CCUK is working with the carriers to resolve differences, and it is possible that some form of negotiated settlement will occur that would relieve the carriers of their site leasing commitments. See " CCUK Take or Pay Agreements". Network services revenues in the U.S. consist of revenues from: (1) antenna installation, (2) site acquisition, (3) site development and construction, (4) network design and site selection, and (5) other services. Network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies. Network services revenues in the U.S. are recognized under service contracts which provide for billings on either a fixed price basis or a time and materials basis. Demand for our network services fluctuates from period to period and within periods. See "Item 1. Business Risk Factors Variability in Demand for Services Business Has Reduced the Predictability of Our Results". Consequently, the operating results of our network services businesses for any particular period may vary significantly, and should not be considered as indicative of longer term results. In 2002, we made a strategic decision to reduce our network services offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites and radio frequency planning and testing. We also derive services revenues from the ownership and operation of microwave radio and SMR networks in Puerto Rico where we own radio wave spectrum in the 2,000 MHz and 6,000 MHz range (for microwave radio) and the 800 MHz range (for specialized mobile radio). These revenues are generally recognized under monthly management or service agreements. Network services revenues in the U.K. consist of (1) network design and site selection, site acquisition, site development and antenna installation and (2) site management and other services. Network design and development and related services are provided to: (1) a number of broadcasting and related organizations, both in the United Kingdom and other countries, (2) certain U.K. cellular operators, and (3) Hutchison as part of their deployment of 3G services in the U.K. These services are often subject to a competitive bid, and a significant proportion result from an operator coming onto an existing CCUK site. Revenues from such services are recognized on either a fixed price or a time and materials basis. Site management and other services, consisting of both network monitoring and equipment maintenance, are carried out in the U.K. for a number of emergency service organizations. CCUK receives revenues for such services under contracts with original terms of between three and five years. Such contracts provide fixed prices for network monitoring and variable pricing dependent on the level of equipment maintenance carried out in a given period. Costs of operations for site rental in the U.S. primarily consist of: . land leases; . property taxes; 39 . repairs and maintenance; . employee compensation and related benefits costs; . utilities; . insurance; and . monitoring costs. For any given tower, such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as additional customers are added. Costs of operations for broadcast transmission services in the U.K. consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs, utilities, rental payments under the Site Sharing Agreement with NTL, circuit costs, repairs and maintenance on both transmission equipment and structures, property taxes and insurance. Site rental operating costs in the U.K. consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs, utilities and repairs, maintenance and leases of land or rooftop sites, property taxes and insurance. With the exception of land and rooftop leases, the majority of such costs are relatively fixed in nature, with increases in revenue from new installations on existing sites generally being achieved without a corresponding increase in costs. Generally, leases of land and rooftop sites have a revenue sharing component that averages 20% to 35% of additional revenues added from subsequent tenants. Costs of operations for network services consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs, subcontractor services, consulting fees, and other on site construction and materials costs. We incur these network services costs (1) to support our internal operations, including maintenance of our owned towers, and (2) to maintain the employees necessary to provide services to third parties. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: . employee compensation, training, recruitment and related benefits costs; . professional and consulting fees; . office rent and related expenses; . state franchise taxes; and . travel costs. Corporate development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and development of new business initiatives. These expenses consist primarily of: . allocated compensation and related benefits costs; . external professional fees; and . overhead costs that are not directly related to the administration or management of existing towers. Depreciation and amortization charges relate to our property and equipment (which consists primarily of towers, broadcast transmission equipment, associated buildings, construction equipment and vehicles) and other intangible assets recorded in connection with business acquisitions. Depreciation of towers and broadcast transmission equipment is generally computed with a useful life of 20 years. Amortization of other intangible assets (principally the value of existing site rental contracts at Crown Communication) is computed with a useful life of 10 years. Depreciation of buildings is generally computed with useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years. Depreciation of construction equipment and vehicles is generally computed with useful lives of 10 years and 5 years, respectively. 40 During 2000 and 2001 we completed the transactions with BellSouth and BellSouth DCS. In 2000, we completed the transaction with GTE. Additionally, during 2000 Crown Atlantic acquired the Frontier towers from Bell Atlantic Mobile, and CCAL completed the substantial portion of the transaction with Cable & Wireless Optus. Results of operations of these acquired businesses and towers are included in our consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition. In addition, we have various transactions recorded in our financial statements (as described below) that are non recurring in nature. As such, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2001, and the results for the year ended December 31, 2001 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2000. During 2002, US wireless carriers developed significantly fewer new communications sites than were developed in 2001. As a result, the pace at which we were able to add new tenants to our sites decreased by approximately 40% during 2002. Network services revenues have also been adversely impacted in the US due to reduced antenna installation activity related to the decrease in new tenants, along with our strategic decision to reduce our US network services offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites and radio frequency planning and testing. Network services revenues declined as a percentage of our total revenues during 2002, and we expect such decline as a percentage of total revenues to continue in the foreseeable future. The following information is derived from our historical Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated.

CCUSAs revenues for 2002 were $455.1 million, a decrease of $68.7 million from 2001. This decrease was attributable to a $122.8 million, or 48.4%, decrease in network services and other revenues, 41 partially offset by a $54.1 million increase in site rental revenues. The increase in site rental revenues reflects the new tenant additions on our tower sites and contractual escalations on existing leases. The decrease in network services and other revenues reflects a decrease in demand for antenna installation from our tenants, along with our strategic decision to reduce our US network services offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites and radio frequency planning and testing. We expect that network services and other revenues will continue to decline as a percentage of CCUSAs total revenues. Costs of operations for 2002 were $217.4 million, a decrease of $63.1 million from 2001. This decrease was attributable to a $70.9 million decrease in network services costs, partially offset by a $7.7 million increase in site rental costs. Costs of operations for site rental as a percentage of site rental revenues decreased to 34.2% for 2002 from 38.2% for 2001. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues increased to 81.4% for 2002 from 69.9% for 2001. General and administrative expenses for 2002 were $56.2 million, a decrease of $5.0 million from 2001. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 12.3% for 2002 from 11.7% for 2001. For 2002, CCUSA recorded restructuring charges and asset write down charges of $4.3 million and $39.2 million, respectively (see " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges"). CCUSA recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges of $2.1 million for 2002 and 2001 (see " Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions"). Depreciation and amortization for 2002 was $183.5 million, an increase of $5.5 million from 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to a $16.4 million increase in depreciation related to property and equipment, partially offset by a $9.8 million decrease in goodwill amortization and a $1.1 million decrease in amortization of other intangible assets resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets (see " Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards"). Interest and other income (expense) for 2002 was $(1.2) million, a decrease of $2.6 million from 2001. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2002 was $38.4 million, a decrease of $14.9 million from 2001. This decrease was attributable to lower interest rates on bank indebtedness. CCAL. CCALs revenues for 2002 were $26.0 million, an increase of $6.0 million from 2001. This increase was attributable to a $5.2 million, or 28.4%, increase in site rental revenues and a $0.8 million increase in network services and other revenues. The increase in site rental revenues reflects the impact of tower acquisitions, the new tenant additions on our tower sites and termination fees from a customer. Costs of operations for 2002 were $10.5 million, an increase of $2.4 million from 2001. This increase was attributable to a $1.8 million increase in site rental costs and a $0.6 million increase in network services costs. Costs of operations for site rental as a percentage of site rental revenues decreased to 37.9% for 2002 from 39.1% for 2001. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues increased to 65.3% for 2002 from 62.0% for 2001. General and administrative expenses for 2002 were $5.8 million, a decrease of $0.5 million from 2001. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 22.2% for 2002 from 31.3% for 2001. Depreciation and amortization for 2002 was $13.7 million, an increase of $2.6 million from 2001. Interest and other income (expense) was $0.4 million for 2002 and 2001. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2002 was $3.4 million, an increase of $1.0 million from 2001. CCUK. CCUKs revenues for 2002 were $300.8 million, an increase of $63.1 million from 2001. This increase was attributable to a $30.8 million, or 15.0%, increase in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues and a $32.3 million increase in network services and other revenues. The increase in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues reflects the new tenant additions on our tower sites, partially offset by a temporary disruption in digital broadcast transmission revenues (see "Item 1. Business The Company U.K. Operations"). The increase in network services and other revenues reflects continued demand for antenna installation from our tenants. Costs of operations for 2002 were $167.7 million, an increase of $43.4 million from 2001. This increase was attributable to a $17.1 million increase in site rental and broadcast transmission costs and a $26.4 million increase in network services costs. Costs of operations for site rental and broadcast transmission as a percentage of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues increased to 48.1% for 2002 from 47.0% for 2001. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues decreased to 84.0% for 2002 from 86.3% for 2001. General and administrative expenses for 2002 were $10.0 million, a 42 decrease of $1.4 million from 2001. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 3.3% for 2002 from 4.8% for 2001. For 2002, CCUK recorded restructuring charges and asset write down charges of $8.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively (see " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges"). For 2002, CCUK recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges of $1.9 million, compared to $2.6 million for 2001 (see " Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions"). Depreciation and amortization for 2002 was $61.5 million, a decrease of $32.0 million from 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $47.5 million decrease in goodwill amortization resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets (see " Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards"), partially offset by a $15.5 million increase in depreciation related to property and equipment. Interest and other income (expense) for 2002 was $1.5 million, a decrease of $3.9 million from 2001. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2002 was $28.7 million, an increase of $2.0 million from 2001. CCUKs provision for income taxes of $11.9 million for 2002 consists of a non cash deferred tax liability. This deferred tax liability resulted from an excess of basis differences for its property and equipment over its available tax net operating losses. Crown Atlantic. Crown Atlantics revenues for 2002 were $119.6 million, an increase of $2.1 million from 2001. This increase was attributable to an $11.8 million, or 14.4%, increase in site rental revenues, partially offset by a $9.6 million decrease in network services and other revenues. The increase in site rental revenues reflects the new tenant additions on our tower sites and contractual escalations on existing leases. The decrease in network services and other revenues reflects a decrease in demand for antenna installation from our tenants, along with our strategic decision to reduce our US network services offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites and radio frequency planning and testing. We expect that network services and other revenues will continue to decline as a percentage of Crown Atlantics total revenues. Costs of operations for 2002 were $50.5 million, a decrease of $3.7 million from 2001. This decrease was attributable to an $8.4 million decrease in network services costs, partially offset by a $4.7 million increase in site rental costs. Costs of operations for site rental as a percentage of site rental revenues increased to 39.1% for 2002 from 39.0% for 2001. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues decreased to 53.6% for 2002 from 62.7% for 2001. General and administrative expenses for 2002 were $5.5 million, a decrease of $2.6 million from 2001. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 4.6% for 2002 from 7.0% for 2001. For 2002, Crown Atlantic recorded restructuring charges and asset write down charges of $0.9 million and $11.1 million, respectively (see " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges"). Depreciation and amortization for 2002 was $41.4 million, a decrease of $2.9 million from 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $3.2 million decrease in goodwill amortization resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets (see " Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards"), partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in depreciation related to property and equipment. Interest and other income (expense) for 2002 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $0.1 million from 2001. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2002 was $18.4 million, a decrease of $2.2 million from 2001. Corporate Office and Other. General and administrative expenses for 2002 were $16.8 million, an increase of $1.2 million from 2001. Corporate development expenses for 2002 were $7.5 million, compared to $12.3 million for 2001. For 2002, the corporate office recorded restructuring charges and asset write down charges of $3.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively (see " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges"). For 2002 and 2001, the corporate office recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges of $1.4 million (see " Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions"). Depreciation and amortization for 2002 was $1.9 million, an increase of $0.2 million from 2001. Interest and other income (expense) for 2002 was $65.6 million, an increase of $64.5 million from 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to gains on debt repurchases of approximately $79.1 million, partially offset by charges of approximately $29.1 million for our share of losses incurred by, and the write down of our investments in, unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2002 was $213.7 million, an increase of $19.3 million from 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to interest on the 9 3/8% senior notes, which were issued in May of 2001. 43 Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Consolidated Consolidated revenues for 2002 were $901.5 million, an increase of $2.6 million from 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1) a $101.9 million, or 17.7%, increase in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues, of which $30.8 million was attributable to CCUK, $11.8 million was attributable to Crown Atlantic, $5.2 million was attributable to CCAL and $54.1 million was attributable to CCUSA, (2) a $32.3 million increase in network services and other revenues from CCUK, and (3) a $0.8 million increase in network services and other revenues from CCAL, largely offset by (4) a $122.8 million decrease in network services and other revenues from CCUSA, and (5) a $9.6 million decrease in network services and other revenues from Crown Atlantic. The following is a summary of tenant leasing activity on our tower sites: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2002 New tenants added on existing, newly constructed and acquired tower sites, net: CCUSA (includes 130 tenants from acquired tower sites in 2001).............. 3,772 1,900 Crown Atlantic.............................................................. 710 341 CCUK (includes 578 tenants from acquired tower sites in 2001)............... 2,887 1,363 CCAL (includes 1,054 tenants from acquired tower sites in 2001)............. 1,448 446 8,817 4,050 Average monthly lease rate per new tenant added on existing tower sites: CCUSA and Crown Atlantic.................................................... $1,481 $1,491 CCUK........................................................................ 779 1,092 CCAL........................................................................ 607 540 The increases in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues reflect the new tenant additions on our tower sites and contractual escalations on existing leases. However, after excluding the new tenants from acquired tower sites in 2001, the level of tenant leasing activity on our sites declined by approximately 40% in 2002 as compared to 2001. The increases or decreases in network services and other revenues reflect fluctuations in demand for antenna installation from our tenants, along with our strategic decision to reduce our US network services offerings to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites and radio frequency planning and testing. We expect that network services and other revenues will continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues for CCUSA and Crown Atlantic. Costs of operations for 2002 were $446.2 million, a decrease of $21.0 million from 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to: (1) a $70.9 million decrease in network services costs related to CCUSA and (2) an $8.4 million decrease in network services costs from Crown Atlantic, partially offset by (3) a $31.3 million increase in site rental and broadcast transmission costs, of which $17.1 million was attributable to CCUK, $4.7 million was attributable to Crown Atlantic, $1.8 million was attributable to CCAL and $7.7 million was attributable to CCUSA, (4) a $26.4 million increase in network services costs from CCUK and (5) a $0.6 million increase in network services costs from CCAL. Costs of operations for site rental and broadcast transmission as a percentage of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues decreased to 39.8% for 2002 from 41.5% for 2001 because of higher margins attributable 44 to incremental revenues from the CCUSA and CCAL operations. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues increased to 78.8% for 2002 from 70.7% for 2001 because of lower margins from the CCUSA and CCAL operations. General and administrative expenses for 2002 were $94.2 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to: (1) a $5.0 million decrease in expenses related to the CCUSA operations, (2) a $2.6 million decrease in expenses at Crown Atlantic, (3) a $1.4 million decrease in expenses at CCUK, and (4) a $0.5 million decrease in expenses at CCAL, partially offset by (5) a $1.2 million increase in expenses at our corporate office. The decreases in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from lower staffing levels after the restructurings of our business announced in 2001 and 2002, partially offset by a charge of approximately $2.6 million for a bad debt provision at CCUK related to the ITV Digital liquidation (see "Item 1. Business The Company U.K. Operations Transmission Business Digital Transmission and Broadcast ("Freeview")"). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 10.5% for 2002 from 11.4% for 2001 because of lower overhead costs as a percentage of revenues for CCAL, CCUK and Crown Atlantic. Corporate development expenses for 2002 were $7.5 million, compared to $12.3 million for 2001. This decrease was attributable to a decrease in expenses at our corporate office. For 2002, we recorded cash restructuring charges of $17.1 million, compared to $19.4 million for 2001. Such charges related to employee severance payments and costs of office closures. See " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges". During 2002, we recorded asset write down charges of $39.2 million for CCUSA, $11.1 million for Crown Atlantic and $2.4 million at our corporate office. Such non cash charges related to the abandonment of a portion of our construction in process for certain open projects, the cancellation of certain build to suit agreements and write downs of the related construction in process, write downs of certain inventories, and write downs of three office buildings. In 2002, we also recorded asset write down charges of $3.2 million for CCUK related to certain inventories and property and equipment. In 2001, we recorded asset write down charges of $24.9 million in connection with the July 2001 restructuring. Such non cash charges related to write downs of certain inventories, property and equipment, and other assets. See " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges". For 2002, we recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges of $5.3 million related to the issuance of stock and stock options to certain employees and executives, compared to $6.1 million for 2001. See " Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions". Depreciation and amortization for 2002 was $301.9 million, a decrease of $26.6 million from 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to: (1) a $60.5 million decrease in goodwill amortization resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard for goodwill and other intangible assets, of which $9.8 million was attributable to CCUSA, $47.5 million was attributable to CCUK and $3.2 million was attributable to Crown Atlantic (see " Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards"), partially offset by (2) a $15.5 million increase in depreciation related to property and equipment from CCUK, (3) a $16.4 million increase in depreciation related to property and equipment, offset by a $1.1 million decrease in amortization of other intangible assets, from CCUSA, 45 (4) a $2.6 million increase in depreciation related to property and equipment from CCAL, and (5) a $0.3 million increase in depreciation related to property and equipment from Crown Atlantic. Interest and other income (expense) for 2002 resulted primarily from: (1) interest income and foreign exchange gains from invested cash balances, and (2) gains of approximately $79.1 million on debt repurchases, partially offset by (3) charges of approximately $29.1 million for our share of losses incurred by, and the write down of our investments in, unconsolidated affiliates, and (4) costs incurred in connection with unsuccessful investment projects. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2002 was $302.6 million, an increase of $5.1 million, or 1.7%, from 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to interest on the 9 3/8% senior notes, partially offset by lower interest rates on bank indebtedness at CCUSA and Crown Atlantic. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources". The provision for income taxes of $12.3 million for 2002 consists primarily of a non cash deferred tax liability recognized by CCUK. CCUKs deferred tax liability resulted from differences between book and tax basis for its property and equipment. Minority interests represent the minority partners 43.1% interest in Crown Atlantics operations, the minority partners 17.8% interest in the operations of the GTE joint venture and the minority shareholders 22.4% interest in the CCAL operations. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Operating Segments CCUSA. CCUSAs revenues for 2001 were $523.8 million, an increase of $194.6 million from 2000. This increase was attributable to an $86.6 million, or 47.2%, increase in site rental revenues and a $108.0 million increase in network services and other revenues. The increase in site rental revenues reflects the new tenant additions on our tower sites. The increase in network services and other revenues reflects continued demand for antenna installation from our tenants along with increased third party service work. Costs of operations for 2001 were $280.5 million, an increase of $120.7 million from 2000. This increase was attributable to a $94.4 million increase in network services costs and a $26.3 million increase in site rental costs. Costs of operations for site rental as a percentage of site rental revenues decreased to 38.2% for 2001 from 41.9% for 2000.

This increase was attributable to an $11.5 million, or 169.3%, increase in site rental revenues and $1.6 million in network services and other revenues. The increase in site rental revenues reflects the impact of tower acquisitions along with the new tenant additions on our tower sites. Costs of operations for 2001 were $8.2 million, an 46 increase of $4.6 million from 2000. This increase was attributable to a $3.6 million increase in site rental costs and $1.0 million in network services costs.

Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2001 was $2.4 million, an increase of $2.3 million from 2000. CCUK. CCUKs revenues for 2001 were $237.7 million, an increase of $20.0 million from 2000. This increase was attributable to a $13.3 million, or 6.9%, increase in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues and a $6.7 million increase in network services and other revenues. The increase in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues reflects the new tenant additions on our tower sites. The increase in network services and other revenues reflects continued demand for antenna installation from our tenants along with increased third party service work. Costs of operations for 2001 were $124.3 million, an increase of $17.9 million from 2000. This increase was attributable to an $8.7 million increase in site rental and broadcast transmission costs and a $9.2 million increase in network services costs. Costs of operations for site rental and broadcast transmission as a percentage of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues increased to 47.0% for 2001 from 45.7% for 2000. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues increased to 86.3% for 2001 from 73.2% for 2000.

Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2001 was $26.7 million, a decrease of $5.3 million from 2000. CCUKs provision for income taxes of $16.0 million for 2001 consists of a non cash deferred tax liability. This deferred tax liability resulted from an excess of basis differences for its property and equipment over its available tax net operating losses. Crown Atlantic. Crown Atlantics revenues for 2001 were $117.5 million, an increase of $22.0 million from 2000. This increase was attributable to an $18.4 million, or 29.0%, increase in site rental revenues and a $3.5 million increase in network services and other revenues.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Consolidated Consolidated revenues for 2001 were $899.0 million, an increase of $249.8 million from 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1) a $129.9 million, or 29.1%, increase in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues, of which $13.3 million was attributable to CCUK, $18.4 million was attributable to Crown Atlantic, $11.5 million was attributable to CCAL and $86.6 million was attributable to CCUSA, (2) a $108.0 million increase in network services and other revenues from CCUSA, (3) a $6.7 million increase in network services and other revenues from CCUK, (4) a $3.5 million increase in network services and other revenues from Crown Atlantic, and (5) $1.6 million in network services and other revenues from CCAL. The following is a summary of tenant leasing activity on our tower sites for the year ended December 31, 2001: New tenants added on existing, newly constructed and acquired tower sites, net: CCUSA (includes 130 tenants from acquired tower sites)...................... 3,772 Crown Atlantic.............................................................. 710 CCUK (includes 578 tenants from acquired tower sites)....................... 2,887 CCAL (includes 1,054 tenants from acquired tower sites)..................... 1,448 8,817 Average monthly lease rate per new tenant added on existing tower sites: CCUSA and Crown Atlantic.................................................... $1,481 CCUK........................................................................ 779 CCAL........................................................................ 607 The increases in site rental and broadcast transmission revenues reflect the new tenant additions on our tower sites. The increases in network services and other revenues reflect continued demand for antenna installation from our tenants along with increased third party service work. Costs of operations for 2001 were $467.2 million, an increase of $152.6 million from 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1) a $44.3 million increase in site rental and broadcast transmission costs, of which $8.7 million was attributable to CCUK, $5.7 million was attributable to Crown Atlantic, $3.6 million was attributable to CCAL and $26.3 million was attributable to CCUSA, (2) a $94.4 million increase in network services costs related to CCUSA, (3) a $9.2 million increase in network services costs from CCUK, (4) a $3.8 million increase in network services costs from Crown Atlantic, and (5) $1.0 million in network services costs from CCAL. 48 Costs of operations for site rental and broadcast transmission as a percentage of site rental and broadcast transmission revenues decreased to 41.5% for 2001 from 43.6% for 2000 because of higher margins attributable to incremental revenues from the Crown Atlantic, CCAL and CCUSA operations. Costs of operations for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues increased to 70.7% for 2001 from 59.2% for 2000 because of lower margins from the CCUSA, CCUK and Crown Atlantic operations. Network services revenues for 2001 included a greater proportion of third party service work than in 2000, and third party services typically produce lower margins than tenant antenna installation services. General and administrative expenses for 2001 were $102.5 million, an increase of $25.6 million from 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1) an $11.4 million increase in expenses related to the CCUSA operations, (2) a $9.4 million increase in expenses at our corporate office, (3) a $3.3 million increase in expenses at CCUK, and (4) a $1.8 million increase in expenses at CCAL, partially offset by (5) a $0.3 million decrease in expenses at Crown Atlantic. The increases in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from higher staffing levels to support the growth of our business. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for 2001 to 11.4% from 11.8% for 2000 because of lower overhead costs as a percentage of revenues for CCUSA, CCAL and Crown Atlantic. Corporate development expenses for 2001 were $12.3 million, compared to $10.5 million for 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses at our corporate office. For 2001, we recorded cash charges of $19.4 million in connection with a restructuring of our business announced in July 2001. Such charges related to employee severance payments and costs of office closures. See " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges". For 2001, we recorded asset write down charges of $24.9 million in connection with the restructuring of our business announced in July 2001. Such non cash charges related to write downs of certain inventories, property and equipment, and other assets. See " Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges". For 2001, we recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges of $6.1 million related to the issuance of stock and stock options to certain employees and executives, compared to $3.1 million for 2000. See " Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions". Depreciation and amortization for 2001 was $328.5 million, an increase of $89.7 million from 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1) a $16.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the property and equipment and goodwill from CCUK, (2) a $10.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the property and equipment and goodwill from Crown Atlantic, (3) a $5.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to property and equipment from CCAL, and (4) a $56.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to the property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets related to the CCUSA operations. 49 Interest and other income (expense) for 2001 resulted primarily from: (1) the investment of the net proceeds from our securities offerings, offset by (2) costs incurred in connection with unsuccessful acquisition attempts and (3) our share of losses incurred by unconsolidated affiliates. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2001 was $297.4 million, an increase of $56.2 million, or 23.3%, from 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to interest on indebtedness at CCUSA, CCUK and Crown Atlantic, and interest on the 103/4% senior notes and the 9 3/8% senior notes. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources". The provision for income taxes of $16.5 million for 2001 consists primarily of a non cash deferred tax liability recognized by CCUK. CCUKs deferred tax liability resulted from an excess of basis differences for its property and equipment over its available tax net operating losses. Minority interests represent the minority partners 43.1% interest in Crown Atlantics operations, the minority partners 17.8% interest in the operations of the GTE joint venture and the minority shareholders 22.4% interest in the CCAL operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our business strategy contemplates substantial capital expenditures, although significantly reduced from previous years levels, in connection with the selective expansion of our tower portfolios in the markets in which we currently operate. During 2003, we expect that the majority of our discretionary capital expenditures (other than the (Pounds)50.0 million site access fee payment due to British Telecom) will occur at CCUK in connection with the development of the sites acquired from British Telecom. Since its inception, CCIC has generally funded its activities, other than acquisitions and investments, through excess proceeds from contributions of equity capital and cash provided by operations. CCIC has financed acquisitions and investments with the proceeds from equity contributions, borrowings under our senior credit facilities and issuances of debt securities. Since its inception, CCUK has generally funded its activities, other than the acquisition of the BBC home service transmission business, through cash provided by operations and borrowings under CCUKs credit facility. CCUK financed the acquisition of the BBC home service transmission business with the proceeds from equity contributions and the issuance of the CCUK bonds. During 2002, we have taken actions to reduce, delay or eliminate contractual obligations for certain capital expenditures. We have accomplished the following: (1) the deferral of a (Pounds)50.0 million payment due to British Telecom from 2002 to 2003, and (2) the completion and winding up (by mutual agreement) of build to suit contracts with two significant customers of CCUSA and Crown Atlantic, thereby eliminating future tower construction obligations. These actions, and others we are pursuing, will serve to increase our financial flexibility and improve our ability to allocate our capital on a discretionary basis to the highest yielding investments, including the securities repurchases as described below. Our goal is to maximize net cash from operating activities and fund substantially all capital spending and debt service from our operating cash flow beginning in 2003, without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash and liquid investments. However, due to the risk factors outlined above, there can be no assurance that this will be possible. For the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, our net cash provided by operating activities was $165.5 million, $131.9 million and $208.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 50 and 2002, our net cash provided by (used for) financing activities was $1,707.1 million, $1,109.3 million and $(335.1) million, respectively. For the year ending December 31, 2003, we expect that our net cash provided by operating activities will be between approximately $140 million and $200 million. Capital expenditures were $277.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, of which $0.7 million were for CCIC, $82.4 million were for CCUSA, $23.5 million were for Crown Atlantic, $165.6 million were for CCUK and $5.1 million were for CCAL. We anticipate that we will build, through the end of 2003, approximately 10 to 20 towers in the United States at a cost of approximately $4.8 million and approximately 240 to 280 tower sites in the United Kingdom at a cost of approximately $16.0 million. In addition, we are obligated to pay a site access fee to British Telecom in the amount of (Pounds)50.0 million ($80.5 million), with such payment due in March 2003. We are currently in discussions regarding the mitigation of this payment, but there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. We also expect to spend approximately $40.0 million for tower improvements, including enhancements to the structural capacity of our towers in order to support the anticipated leasing, and approximately $40.0 million for maintenance activities. For the year ending December 31, 2003, we expect that our total capital expenditures will be between approximately $95 million and $125 million. As such, we expect that our capital expenditures for this period, excluding the payment to British Telecom, will be fully funded by net cash from operating activities, as discussed above. We expect that the construction of new tower sites will continue to have an impact on our liquidity. We expect that once integrated, these new towers will have a positive impact on liquidity, but will require some period of time to offset the initial adverse impact on liquidity. In addition, we believe that as new towers become operational and we begin to add tenants, they should result in a long term increase in liquidity. Our decisions regarding the construction of new towers are discretionary, and depend upon expectations of achieving acceptable rates of return given current market conditions. Such decisions are influenced by the availability of capital and expected returns on alternative investments. We have increased our minimum acceptable level for internal rates of return on new tower builds given current market conditions, and expect to continue to decrease the number of new towers built in the foreseeable future. To fund the execution of our business strategy, including the construction of new towers, we expect to use our available cash balances and cash provided by future operations. We do not currently expect to utilize further borrowings available under our U.S. and U.K. credit facilities in any significant amounts. We will have additional cash needs to fund our operations in the future. We may also have additional cash needs in the future if additional tower acquisitions, build to suit or other opportunities arise. If we do not otherwise have cash available, or borrowings under our credit facilities have otherwise been utilized, when our cash need arises, we would be forced to seek additional debt or equity financing or to forego the opportunity. In the event we determine to seek additional debt or equity financing, there can be no assurance that any such financing will be available, on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or permitted by the terms of our existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2002, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $516.2 million (including $49.4 million at CCUSA, $113.3 million at CCUK, $10.6 million at Crown Atlantic, $16.3 million at CCAL, $167.2 million in an unrestricted investment subsidiary and $159.4 million at CCIC and a restricted investment subsidiary), consolidated liquid investments (consisting of marketable securities) of $115.7 million, consolidated long term debt of $3,227.0 million, consolidated redeemable preferred stock of $756.0 million and consolidated stockholders equity of $2,208.5 million. In June, September and December of 2002, we paid our quarterly dividends on the 81/4% Convertible Preferred Stock by issuing a total of 3.7 million shares of our common stock. As allowed by the Deposit Agreement relating to dividend payments on the 81/4% Convertible Preferred Stock, we repurchased the 3.7 million shares of common stock from the dividend paying agent for a total of $12.2 million in cash. We utilized cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect the stock repurchases. We may choose to continue such issuances and repurchases of stock in the future in order to avoid further dilution caused by the issuance of common stock as dividends on our preferred stock. 51 In July of 2002, we repurchased 8.5 million shares of our common stock for $18.3 million in cash. The shares purchased by us represented all of the remaining shares previously owned by affiliates of France Telecom. The purchase was conducted through a privately negotiated transaction. We utilized cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect the stock repurchase. In September 2002, Crown Atlantic repaid $50.0 million in outstanding borrowings under its credit facility. Crown Atlantic utilized cash provided by its operations to effect this repayment. In August and September of 2002, we began repurchasing our stock (both common and preferred) and debt securities in public market transactions. Through December of 2002, we repurchased debt securities with an aggregate principal amount (at maturity) of $244.6 million. Such debt securities had an aggregate carrying value (net of unamortized discounts) of $226.5 million. We utilized $142.8 million in cash ($96.5 million from an unrestricted investment subsidiary and $46.3 million from CCIC) to effect these debt repurchases. The debt repurchases resulted in gains of $79.1 million. Through December of 2002, we repurchased shares of preferred stock with an aggregate redemption amount of $162.9 million. Such shares of preferred stock had an aggregate carrying value (net of unamortized issue costs) of $160.4 million. We utilized $61.0 million in cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect these preferred stock repurchases. The preferred stock repurchases resulted in gains of $99.4 million. Such gains are offset against dividends on preferred stock in determining the net loss applicable to common stock for the calculation of loss per common share. When the debt and preferred stock repurchases are added together, we have spent approximately $203.8 million in cash to retire securities with aggregate principal and redemption amounts (at maturity) of approximately $407.4 million. These repurchases (at an average discount to par value of approximately 50%) represent an attractive use of our liquidity, and the future interest savings will enhance our cash flow from operating activities. Through December of 2002, we also repurchased a total of 1.5 million shares of common stock. We utilized $3.0 million in cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect these common stock repurchases. In March of 2003, we repurchased additional shares of our preferred stock in a public market transaction. Such shares of preferred stock had an aggregate redemption amount and carrying value of $12.7 million. We utilized $9.4 million in cash from an unrestricted investment subsidiary to effect this March preferred stock repurchase. The March preferred stock repurchase resulted in a gain of $3.3 million. We seek to allocate our available capital among the investment alternatives that provide the greatest returns given current market conditions. As such, we may continue to acquire sites, build new towers and make improvements to existing towers when the expected returns from such expenditures meet our investment criteria. In addition, we may continue to utilize a portion of our available cash balances to repurchase our own stock (either common or preferred) or debt securities from time to time as market prices make such investments attractive. In April 2002, ITV Digital ("ITVD", a significant customer of CCUK) announced plans to liquidate its assets and returned its digital terrestrial television multiplex licenses to the UK Independent Television Commission (See "Item 1. Business The Company U.K. Operations Transmission Business Digital Transmission and Broadcast ("Freeview")"). The termination of the ITVD transmission contract was a Termination Event (a defined event of default) under CCUKs credit facility. In November 2002, we obtained an amendment to CCUKs credit facility such that the Termination Event was cured. The amended CCUK credit facility consists of a (Pounds)120.0 million (approximately $193.1 million) secured revolving loan facility. Since we were able to obtain an amendment to CCUKs credit facility, the termination of the ITVD transmission contract did not result in an event of default under the trust deed governing the CCUK bonds. None of our other debt instruments, including our public debt securities and the two U.S. bank credit facilities, contained default provisions related to the ITVD transmission contract. Furthermore, none of these other debt instruments contain cross default provisions with either of the CCUK debt instruments. As such, the events of default under the two CCUK debt instruments did not constitute events of default under any of our other debt instruments. 52 As of March 17, 2003, Crown Atlantic had unused borrowing availability under its amended credit facility of approximately $84.5 million, and CCUK had unused borrowing availability under its amended credit facility of approximately (Pounds)30.0 million ($48.3 million). As of March 17, 2003, our restricted U.S. and Australian subsidiaries had approximately $367.6 million of unused borrowing availability under the 2000 credit facility. Our various credit facilities require our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial covenants and place restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt and liens, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, undertake transactions with affiliates and make investments. These facilities also limit the ability of the borrowing subsidiaries to pay dividends to CCIC. The primary factors that determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with their debt covenants are (1) their current financial performance (as defined in the various credit agreements), (2) their levels of indebtedness and (3) their debt service requirements. Since we do not currently expect that our subsidiaries will need to utilize significant additional borrowings under their credit facilities, the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would result from a deterioration of a subsidiarys financial performance. In addition, certain of the credit facilities will require that financial performance increase in future years as covenant calculations become more restrictive. Should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance (or for any other reason), we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation continues. Any such early principal payments would have to be made from our existing cash balances. If we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements, including interest payments on the notes, in the future. Our 10 5/8% discount notes, our 9% senior notes, our 91/2% senior notes, our 103/4% senior notes and our 9 3/8% senior notes require annual cash interest payments of approximately $25.4 million, $14.9 million, $10.9 million, $47.6 million and $38.2 million, respectively. Prior to May 15, 2004 and August 1, 2004, the interest expense on our 10 3/8% discount notes and our 111/4% discount notes, respectively, will be comprised solely of the amortization of original issue discount. Thereafter, the 10 3/8% discount notes and the 111/4% discount notes will require annual cash interest payments of approximately $46.6 million and $22.8 million, respectively. Prior to December 15, 2003, we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our 123/4% exchangeable preferred stock or, if issued, cash interest on the exchange debentures. Thereafter, assuming all dividends or interest have been paid in kind, our exchangeable preferred stock or, if issued, the exchange debentures will require annual cash dividend or interest payments of approximately $34.3 million. Annual cash interest payments on the CCUK bonds are (Pounds)11.25 million ($18.1 million). In addition, our various credit facilities will require periodic interest payments on amounts borrowed thereunder, which amounts could be substantial. As a holding company, CCIC will require distributions or dividends from its subsidiaries, or will be forced to use capital raised in debt and equity offerings, to fund its debt obligations, including interest payments on the cash pay notes and eventually the 10 3/8% discount notes and the 111/4% discount notes. The terms of the indebtedness of our subsidiaries significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to CCIC. As a result, we will be required to apply a portion of the net proceeds from the debt offerings to fund interest payments on the notes. If we do not retain sufficient funds from the offerings or any future financing, we may not be able to make our interest payments on the notes. 53 The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2002: Years Ending December 31, 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Totals (In thousands of dollars) Long term debt................................ $ 14,250 $ 62,975 $229,261 $305,869 $541,848 $2,163,250 $3,317,453 Interest payments on long term debt (a)....... 204,616 223,597 263,726 249,498 242,287 696,524 1,880,248 Capital lease obligations..................... 3,386 2,089 98 3 5,576 Operating lease obligations................... 142,185 135,155 132,550 131,397 130,977 615,100 1,287,364 Site access fee to British Telecom, secured by letter of credit............................. 80,475 80,475 Redeemable preferred stock.................... 800,717 800,717 Dividend payments on exchangeable preferred stock........................................ 36,040 36,040 36,040 36,040 108,120 252,280 $444,912 $459,856 $661,675 $722,807 $951,152 $4,383,711 $7,624,113 (a) Interest payments on floating rate debt are estimated based on rates in effect during the first quarter of 2003. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our joint venture agreements with Bell Atlantic Mobile and GTE (both now part of Verizon Communications) provide that, upon dissolution of either venture, Verizon Communications will receive (1) the shares of our common stock contributed to the venture (15,597,783 shares for the Bell Atlantic Mobile venture and 5,063,731 shares for the GTE venture) and (2) a payment equal to a percentage of the fair market value (to be determined based on an appraisal process at the dissolution date) of the ventures other net assets. As of December 31, 2002, such percentages would be approximately 24.1% for the Bell Atlantic Mobile venture and 11.0% for the GTE venture. The 24.1% payment for the Bell Atlantic Mobile venture could be paid either in cash or shares of our common stock, at our election. The 11.0% payment for the GTE venture could only be paid in cash. A dissolution of either venture may be triggered (1) by Verizon Communications at any time, after a 30 day notice period and (2) by us at any time following the fourth anniversary of such ventures formation (subject to certain penalties if prior to the seventh anniversary for the Bell Atlantic Mobile venture). Our joint venture with Bell Atlantic Mobile was formed on March 31, 1999, and our joint venture with GTE was formed on January 31, 2000. See "Item 1. Business The Company U.S. Operations Overview". During 2002, we issued letters of credit to various insurers in connection with certain contingent retirement obligations under various tower site land leases. The letters of credit were issued through one of CCUSAs lenders in amounts aggregating $8.5 million and expire on various dates through October 2003. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of, or to pay interest on, our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations, will depend on our future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to refinance any indebtedness in the future would depend in part on our maintaining adequate credit ratings from the commercial rating agencies. Such credit ratings are dependent on all the liquidity and performance factors discussed above, as well as general expectations that the rating agencies have regarding the outlook for our business and our industry. We anticipate that we may need to refinance a substantial portion of our indebtedness on or prior to its scheduled maturity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effect any required refinancings of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. See "Item 1. Business Risk Factors". Reporting Requirements Under the Indentures Governing the Companys Debt Securities (the "Indentures") and the Certificate of Designations Governing the Companys 123/4% Senior Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the "Certificate") The following information (as such capitalized terms are defined in the Indentures and the Certificate) is presented solely as a requirement of the Indentures and the Certificate; such information is not intended as an 54 alternative measure of financial position, operating results or cash flow from operations (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles). Furthermore, our measure of the following information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

For the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, the GTE venture had revenues from Verizon Communications of $46.2 million, $61.8 million and $67.6 million, respectively. Verizon Communications is our partner in both of these ventures. For the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, CCUK had revenues from the BBC of $96.1 million, $93.7 million and $101.4 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2002, CCUK had revenues from BSkyB of $2.5 million. The BBC and BSkyB are CCUKs partners in Digital TV Services Ltd, which was created to promote Freeview (see "Item 1. Business The Company U.K. Operations Transmission Business Digital Transmission and Broadcast ("Freeview")"). Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges In July 2001, we announced a restructuring of our business in order to increase operational efficiency and better align costs with anticipated revenues. As part of the restructuring, we reduced our global staff by approximately 312 full time employees, closed five offices in the United States and closed our development offices in Brazil and Europe. The actions taken for the restructuring were substantially completed as of the end of 2001. In connection with the restructuring, we recorded cash charges of approximately $19.4 million during 2001 related to employee severance payments ($13.9 million) and costs of office closures ($5.5 million). For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded cash charges of $8.5 million in connection with a restructuring of our CCUK business announced in March 2002. Such charges relate to staff reductions (approximately 212 employees) and the disposition of certain service lines. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we also recorded cash charges of $3.1 million related primarily to additional employee severance payments at our corporate office in connection with the July 2001 restructuring. In October 2002, we announced a restructuring of our U.S. business in order to flatten its organizational structure to better align with customer demand and enhance our regional focus to improve customer service. As part of the restructuring, we are reducing our U.S. workforce by approximately 230 employees and are closing some smaller offices. The actions taken for the October 2002 restructuring will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2003. In connection with this restructuring, we recorded cash charges of approximately $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to employee severance payments ($3.3 million) and costs of office closures ($2.8 million). 56 We have recorded asset write down charges of $24.9 million during 2001 in connection with the restructuring of our business announced in July 2001. Such non cash charges related to the write down of certain inventories ($11.9 million), property and equipment ($8.5 million), and other assets ($4.5 million) that were deemed to have no value as a result of the restructuring. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we abandoned a portion of our construction in process related to certain open projects, mutually agreed to terminate certain build to suit agreements and wrote down the value of the related construction in process, wrote down the value of certain inventories, and wrote down the value of three office buildings. As a result, we have recorded asset write down charges of $39.2 million for CCUSA, $11.1 million for Crown Atlantic and $2.3 million for the corporate office. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we also recorded asset write down charges of $3.2 million for CCUK related to certain inventories and property and equipment. We will continue to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and our property and equipment as required by SFAS 142 and SFAS 144. Implicit in the determination of fair value for such long lived assets are certain assumptions regarding the future leasing of our communication sites. Should future business conditions require the amendment of previous assumptions, our assets could be deemed impaired and a charge to earnings would be required. CCUK Take or Pay Agreements CCUK is a party to two agreements that contemplate a minimum level of site leasing and contain certain "take or pay" commitments by the carriers. One agreement contemplates that at least 1,000 sites will be annually leased for a total of 4,000 sites by 2005. The other agreement contemplates that at least 1,500 sites will be leased by 2004. In each case, the carrier is not leasing the number of sites within the time period contemplated by the agreement and is disputing the terms. It is likely that the carriers will not need the full number of sites originally contemplated. CCUK is working with the carriers to resolve differences and to find viable commercial alternatives to maintain good relationships with such carriers. It is possible that some form of negotiated settlement will occur that would relieve the carriers of their site leasing commitments. However, there can be no assurance that satisfactory results will be achieved in either situation. Compensation Charges Related to Stock Option Grants and Acquisitions We have recognized non cash general and administrative compensation charges related to certain stock options granted to employees and executives prior to our IPO. Such charges amounted to approximately $1.4 million for each of the three years ended December 31, 2002. In July 2000, we issued (1) 199,473 shares of our common stock and (2) options to purchase 17,577 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $.01 per share in connection with an acquisition by CCUK. Such shares and options were deemed to be compensation to the former shareholders of the acquired company (who remained employed by the Company). As a result, CCUK will recognize non cash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately $8.4 million over five years. In September 2000, we issued 336,600 shares of our common stock in connection with an acquisition by CCUSA. Of such shares, 170,710 were deemed to be compensation to the former shareholders of the acquired company (who remained employed by the Company). As a result, CCUSA will recognize non cash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately $5.9 million over four years. During the first quarter of 2003, we granted 5,805,187 shares of restricted common stock to our executives and certain employees. These restricted shares have a weighted average grant date fair value of $4.15 per share. The restrictions on the shares will expire in various annual amounts over the vesting period of five years, with provisions for accelerated vesting based on the market performance of our common stock. In connection with these restricted shares, we will recognize non cash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately $24.1 million over the vesting period. 57 In February 2003, we issued 105,000 shares of common stock to the non executive members of our Board of Directors. These shares have a grant date fair value of $3.95 per share. In connection with these shares, we will recognize non cash general and administrative compensation charges of approximately $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2003. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations ("SFAS 141"), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 141 prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations, and requires that the purchase method be used for all business combinations after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also changes the manner in which acquired intangible assets are identified and recognized apart from goodwill. Further, SFAS 141 requires additional disclosures regarding the reasons for business combinations, the allocation of the purchase price to recognized assets and liabilities and the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets. We have used the purchase method of accounting since our inception, so the adoption of SFAS 141 will not change our method of accounting for business combinations. We have adopted the other recognition and disclosure requirements of SFAS 141 as of July 1, 2001 for any future business combinations. The transition provisions of SFAS 141 require that the carrying amounts for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in prior purchase method business combinations be reviewed and reclassified in accordance with the new recognition rules; such reclassifications are to be made in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 142. The application of these transition provisions of SFAS 141 as of January 1, 2002 resulted in a reclassification of other intangible assets with finite useful lives (the value of site rental contracts from the acquisition of Crown Communication) to deferred financing costs and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. The gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization and net book value of such reclassified intangible assets were approximately $26.0 million, $11.5 million and $14.5 million at January 1, 2002, respectively, and $26.0 million, $12.9 million and $13.1 million at December 31, 2002, respectively. The net book value of these intangible assets will be amortized using a revised life of 10 years, resulting in amortization expense of approximately $1.5 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2002 through 2007. We have no other intangible assets from prior business combinations. SFAS 142 changes the accounting and disclosure requirements for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. The most significant provision of SFAS 142 is that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will no longer be amortized, but rather will be tested for impairment on an annual basis. This annual impairment test will involve (1) a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values, and (2) a step to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over such lives, and tested for impairment in accordance with our existing policies. SFAS 142 requires disclosures about goodwill and other intangible assets in the periods subsequent to their acquisition, including (1) changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, in total and by operating segment, (2) the carrying amounts of intangible assets subject to amortization and those which are not subject to amortization, (3) information about impairment losses recognized, and (4) the estimated amount of intangible asset amortization expense for the next five years. The provisions of SFAS 142 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. In addition, the nonamortization provisions of SFAS 142 were to be immediately applied for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations subsequent to June 30, 2001. We have adopted the requirements of SFAS 142 as of January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 requires that transitional impairment tests be performed at its adoption, and provides that resulting impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be reported as the effect of a change in accounting principle. We have completed our transitional impairment tests and have determined that no impairment losses for goodwill and other intangible assets were to be recorded upon the adoption of SFAS 142. Our depreciation and amortization expense has decreased by approximately $60.6 million per year as a result of the adoption of SFAS 142. If amortization of goodwill had not been recorded, and if amortization of other intangible assets had been recorded using the revised life, our net loss and loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 would have been $158.1 million ($1.22 per share), $304.5 million ($1.79 per share) and $272.5 million ($1.16 per share), respectively. 58 During the fourth quarter of 2002, we performed our annual update of the impairment test for goodwill. The results of this test indicate that goodwill is not impaired at any of our reporting units. However, the amount by which the estimated fair value for CCUSA exceeds its carrying value has declined since January 1, 2002. This decline is a function of our reduced forecasts for site leasing and antenna installation revenues, as indicated by our operating results for 2002. Further declines in our site leasing and network services business at CCUSA could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. Furthermore, if an impairment at CCUSA were to occur in the future, we believe that the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the write off of substantially all of CCUSAs goodwill ($164.0 million). Due to the continued weakness in the telecommunications industry, we intend to closely monitor the performance of our reporting units in 2003 in order to assess whether a goodwill impairment is indicated. In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs. The fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Such asset retirement costs are to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and depreciated over the assets estimated useful life. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations will generally involve discounted future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is to be recorded as an operating expense. The provisions of SFAS 143 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, with initial application as of the beginning of the fiscal year. We will adopt the requirements of SFAS 143 as of January 1, 2003, and have not yet determined the effect that such adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements. However, we do expect that contingent retirement obligations under certain of our tower site land leases will require recognition as liabilities under SFAS 143. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 144 supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of ("SFAS 121"), but retains many of its fundamental provisions. SFAS 144 also clarifies certain measurement and classification issues from SFAS 121. In addition, SFAS 144 supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions for the disposal of a business segment as found in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions ("APB 30"). However, SFAS 144 retains the requirement in APB 30 to separately report discontinued operations, and broadens the scope of such requirement to include more types of disposal transactions. The scope of SFAS 144 excludes goodwill and other intangible assets that are not to be amortized, as the accounting for such items is prescribed by SFAS 142. The provisions of SFAS 144 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and are to be applied prospectively. The adoption of the requirements of SFAS 144 as of January 1, 2002 had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections ("SFAS 145"). SFAS 145 amends or rescinds a number of authoritative pronouncements, including Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt ("SFAS 4"). SFAS 4 required that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt that were included in the determination of net income or loss be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect. Upon adoption of SFAS 145, gains and losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item, but rather will generally be classified as part of other income (expense) on our consolidated statement of operations. Any such gains or losses classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods will be reclassified in future financial statement presentations. The provisions of SFAS 145 related to the rescission of SFAS 4 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, with early application encouraged. We have adopted the provisions of SFAS 145 as of January 1, 2002. 59 In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities ("SFAS 146"). SFAS 146 replaces the previous accounting guidance provided by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94 3"). SFAS 146 requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred, rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan (as provided by EITF 94 3). Examples of costs covered by SFAS 146 include certain employee severance costs and lease termination costs that are associated with a restructuring or discontinued operation. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002, and are to be applied prospectively. We will adopt the requirements of SFAS 146 as of January 1, 2003. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure ("SFAS 148"). SFAS 148 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation ("SFAS 123"), to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the provisions of SFAS 123 to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results of operations. We have adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 as of December 31, 2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46"). FIN 46 clarifies existing accounting literature regarding the consolidation of entities in which a company holds a "controlling financial interest". A majority voting interest in an entity has generally been considered indicative of a controlling financial interest. FIN 46 specifies other factors ("variable interests") which must be considered when determining whether a company holds a controlling financial interest in, and therefore must consolidate, an entity ("variable interest entities"). The provisions of FIN 46 are immediately effective for variable interest entities created, or invested in, after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 are effective as of the beginning of the first interim period after June 15, 2003. We will adopt the provisions of FIN 46 as of July 1, 2003, and do not expect that such adoption will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. Cautionary Statement for Purposes of Forward Looking Statements Certain information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K (including statements contained in "Item 1. Business", "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"), as well as other written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, conferences, conference calls, or otherwise, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are subject to the "Safe Harbor" provisions of that section. This information includes, without limitation, expectations, projections, estimates and other forward looking information regarding results of operations, revenues, liquidity, costs and expenses and margins; capital expenditures of wireless carriers and broadcasters; the quality, capacity and further applications and revenue sources of our assets; our competitive position and demand for our assets; timing and demand for anticipated releases and technological advances; the effects of and benefits from acquisitions and strategic alliances; the effect of changes in accounting standards; adversarial proceedings and other contingent liabilities; capital expenditures and financial condition; wireless and broadcast industry conditions; and world economic conditions. These statements are based on current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurances that such expectations will prove correct. When used in this report, the words "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "may," "project" and similar expressions are intended to be among the statements that identify forward looking statements. Important factors 60 which could affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those results which might be projected, forecast, estimated or budgeted in such forward looking statements include, but are not limited to the factors set forth in " Overview" above and "Item 1. Business Risk Factors." Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a result of our international operating, investing and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks, which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In attempting to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities, we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates where economically prudent to do so. Certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital are subject to market risks from fluctuations in market interest rates. The majority of our financial instruments, however, are long term fixed interest rate notes and debentures. A fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point in 2003 would impact our interest expense by approximately $9.4 million. As of December 31, 2002, we have approximately $1,094.9 million of floating rate indebtedness, of which $150.0 million has been effectively converted to fixed rate indebtedness through the use of interest rate swap agreements. The majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the British pound sterling or the Australian dollar, which are the functional currencies of CCUK and CCAL, respectively. As a result of CCUKs and CCALs transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies, the risks associated with currency fluctuations are generally limited to foreign currency translation adjustments. We do not currently hedge against foreign currency translation risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is not significant to our operations. 61
