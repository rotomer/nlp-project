We may choose to continue such issuances and purchases of stock in the future in order to avoid further dilution caused by the issuance of common stock as dividends on our preferred 27 Table of Contents stock.

The results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2000, and the results for the year ended December 31, 2000 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 1999 as a result of business and tower acquisitions consummated in 1999 and 2000.

In addition, we have various transactions recorded in our financial statements that are non recurring in nature.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations), as well as other written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us in other reports, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, conferences, conference calls, or otherwise, may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of that section. This information includes, without limitation, expectations, projections, estimates and other forward looking information regarding results of operations, revenues, liquidity, costs and expenses and margins; our competitive position; demand for our assets, including leasing rates; timing of and demand for technological advances; the effect of changes in accounting standards; adversarial proceedings and other contingent liabilities; funding of our operations and debt service; cash from operating activities; issuances or purchases of our securities; capital expenditures and financial condition; and wireless telecommunications industry conditions. These statements are based on current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurances that such expectations will prove correct. When used in this report, the words anticipate, estimate, expect, may, project and similar expressions are intended to be among the statements that identify forward looking statements. Important factors which could affect actual results and cause actual results to differ materially from those results which might be projected, forecast, estimated or budgeted in such forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the factors set forth in Overview above and Item 1. Business Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a result of our international operating, investing and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks, which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which may adversely affect our results 58 Table of Contents of operations and financial position. In attempting to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities, we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates where economically prudent to do so. Certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital are subject to market risks from fluctuations in market interest rates. The majority of our financial instruments, however, are long term fixed interest rate notes and debentures. A fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point in 2004 would impact our interest expense by approximately $14.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, we have approximately $1,484.8 million of floating rate indebtedness, of which $83.8 million has been effectively converted to fixed rate indebtedness through the use of an interest rate swap agreement. The majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the British pound sterling or the Australian dollar, which are the functional currencies of CCUK and CCAL, respectively. As a result of CCUKs and CCALs transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies, the risks associated with currency fluctuations are primarily associated with foreign currency translation adjustments. However, since we are now able to access cash distributions from CCUK upon its inclusion in our restricted borrowing group, we are subject to currency fluctuations on any such amounts distributed (see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources). We do not currently hedge against foreign currency translation risks and do not currently believe that foreign currency exchange risk is significant to our operations. The foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the 2003 financial statements for CCUK and CCAL were as follows: CCUK (British pound sterling) CCAL (Australian dollar) Average exchange rate for: January 2003 $ 1.6175 $ 0.5829 February 2003 1.6079 0.5956 March 2003 1.5825 0.6015 April 2003 1.5739 0.6100 May 2003 1.6224 0.6468 June 2003 1.6609 0.6652 July 2003 1.6221 0.6607 August 2003 1.5939 0.6518 September 2003 1.6155 0.6635 October 2003 1.6792 0.6948 November 2003 1.6897 0.7158 December 2003 1.7501 0.7385 Ending exchange rate for: March 2003 1.5790 0.6045 June 2003 1.6529 0.6713 September 2003 1.6620 0.6797 December 2003 1.7842 0.7520 59 Table of Contents
