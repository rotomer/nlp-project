Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Overview We own, operate and manage towers for wireless communications which are located in the U.S. and Australia. Our primary business is leasing space on our towers to major wireless communication companies under long term contracts. As of December 31, 2005, we owned, leased or managed 12,459 towers, including 11,074 towers in the U.S. and 1,385 towers in Australia. Our real property interests in the sites on which our towers are located consist primarily of leasehold and sub leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights of way, with approximately 84% of our property interests in such sites being pursuant to ground lease, sublease or license as of December 31, 2005. Our customers currently include many of the worlds major wireless communications companies, including Cingular, Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel, T Mobile, Alltel, Optus and Vodafone Australia. Approximately 81% of our revenues are derived from investment grade customers. Our customers use our towers for antennas and other equipment necessary for the transmission of wireless signals for mobile telephones and other devices. This leasing activity represents approximately 88% of our consolidated revenues. We also provide network services in the U.S. which consist primarily of project management services for antenna installations on our company owned towers on behalf of wireless service providers. As an important part of our business strategy, we seek to: (1) allocate capital efficiently as we selectively build new towers for wireless carriers, acquire other assets, repurchase debt or purchase our own securities, (2) maximize utilization of our tower capacity to grow revenues organically, (3) grow our margins by taking advantage of the relatively fixed nature of the operating costs associated with our site rental business, and (4) utilize the expertise of U.S. and Australian personnel to extend revenues around our existing assets. The growth of our business depends substantially on the condition of the wireless communications industry. The willingness of wireless carriers to utilize our infrastructure and related services is affected by numerous factors, including: consumer demand for wireless services; availability and location of our sites and alternative sites; cost of capital, including interest rates; availability of capital to wireless carriers; willingness to co locate equipment; local restrictions on the proliferation of towers; cost of building towers; technological changes affecting the number of communications sites needed to provide wireless communications services to a given geographic area; our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers service requirements; and tax policies. During the second half of 2003, we began to see signs of increased activity in the form of additional applications for our U.S. sites by wireless carriers. In 2004, the increased activity continued, with the rate of gross new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on a per lease standard basis for our U.S. towers being 38% greater than the comparable period in 2003. The rate of gross new tenant additions on a per lease standard basis for 2005 remained approximately constant with the rate of new additions that we experienced during 2004. Approximately 70% of the dollar value of new tenant additions during 2005 related to new leases, and approximately 30% related to amendments to existing leases. We believe the demand for new communication sites will continue. The demand for new communication sites is influenced by the demand for wireless telephony and data services from our customers. An indicator of demand 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements for wireless telephony and data services is wireless minutes of use (MOUs). Based on published reports from Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association (CTIA), MOUs in the U.S. exceeded 675 billion for the six months ended June 2005, a 30.1% growth from the six months ended June 2004. In addition, the wireless industry reported the largest one year addition of new subscribers in the U.S. since it first offered commercial service in 1983. In the twelve month period ended June 2005, more than 25.0 million subscribers came online in the U.S. increasing total subscribers to 194.5 million as of June 2005. The growth in MOUs, combined with the addition of new subscribers, resulted in approximately 600 MOUs per subscriber per month in the U.S. for the six months ended June 2005. In addition, the demand for new communication sites is influenced by the availability of new spectrum, which is of particular importance in light of the advanced wireless services auction scheduled to begin June 29, 2006. Demand for communication sites could also be affected by carrier consolidation, because consolidation could result in duplicate or overlapping networks. On October 26, 2004, Cingular merged with AT&T Wireless, and on August 12, 2005, Sprint merged with Nextel. These mergers could adversely impact site rental revenues on our towers as a result of these network integrations. Our customers have not notified us of how many leases on our towers will definitively terminate as a result of these network integrations, and we have not yet seen any lease cancellations directly resulting from these mergers. We expect that the termination of these leases will be spread over multiple quarters as existing lease obligations expire. Our belief is consistent with the wireless carriers public comments that indicate that they expect a significant number of net new cell sites to be added during the next couple of years. When wireless carriers identify coverage or capacity gaps, we seek to provide carriers with the following four point value proposition as part of our overall on going goal to increase customer satisfaction relative to our peers while still balancing commercial realities: (1) We will attempt to solve the coverage or capacity gap by collocating on one of our towers; (2) If we dont have a tower to solve the coverage or capacity gap, we will attempt to identify a non Crown Castle structure; (3) If there are no towers or other suitable structures to solve the coverage or capacity gap, we will attempt to build a tower; or (4) If a tower cannot be built to solve the coverage or capacity gap due to zoning or other impediments, we will attempt to build a distributed antenna system. We plan to continue to leverage our asset management tool and the strength of our management team to deliver on this four point value proposition. Current Year Highlights Strong Revenue Growth. Net revenues grew by 8.4% and 12.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, which was primarily driven by site rental revenues from new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on existing towers and, to a lesser extent, contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations and new sites acquired or built since the end of prior fiscal year. New tenant additions and modifications were influenced by the aforementioned on going demand for additional wireless communication sites primarily due to the continued strong growth in the usage of wireless minutes and introduction of new data services by wireless carriers. Significant Margin Expansion. Gross margins (net revenues less cost of operations) grew by 12.8% to $373.2 million and 13.8% to $424.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, which was primarily driven by the increase in site rental revenues. The incremental margin percentage on the site rental revenue growth of $58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 was 77.8%, reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers. Investment Grade Refinancing. We issued $1.9 billion in Tower Revenue Notes through certain of our subsidiaries in June 2005. The notes are rated investment grade, have a weighted average interest rate of 4.89% and are secured by our assignable U.S. personal property, license agreements, revenues and or distributions related to our towers as of June 2005 located in the U.S. See Properties. Proceeds from the notes were used to purchase and 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements redeem $1.5 billion carrying value of existing high yield debt during June and July 2005 and to repay our previously outstanding Crown Atlantic Credit Facility. These purchases and redemptions resulted in losses of $179.1 million and $2.7 million during June and July 2005, respectively. Our annual interest expense was reduced by approximately $53.0 million due to the issuance of the notes and the purchases and redemptions of debt occurring through July 2005. Periodically, beginning in 2006, we contemplate issuing additional notes under a similar structure to the existing Tower Revenue Notes, in order to leverage the anticipated growth in our site rental business. As a result of refinancing our debt in 2005, including the issuance, purchases and redemptions discussed in the preceding paragraph (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities), the weighted average coupon on our debt has been reduced by 2.8% to 5.1% at the end of 2005, from 7.9% at the end of 2004. Additionally, annual interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2006 is expected to be approximately $128.0 million, representing a savings of approximately $5.8 million from 2005 actual interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of $133.8 million despite an increase of $420.3 million, or 22.7%, in outstanding debt from December 2004 to 2005. Purchases and Investments. We believe the debt refinancing provides us significantly more flexibility to invest the cash flow produced from operations in activities that we believe exhibit potential to achieve our risk adjusted return on investment hurdle rates or exhibit potential to complement our core site rental business. Those activities could include acquiring or building towers, improving existing towers, making investments in adjacent businesses including emerging businesses, or purchasing our own stock or debt securities. In 2005, we purchased 16.0 million shares of common stock, exclusive of shares of common stock purchased from the dividend paying agent following the issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock dividend. We utilized $310.1 million in cash to affect these purchases and paid an average price of $19.44 per share. These purchases of common stock, combined with purchases of additional 4% Convertible Senior Notes and all of our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock during 2005, reduced outstanding shares by 16.0 million, or 7.1%, and potential future outstanding shares by an additional 18.3 million. Also, in 2005, we purchased 467 towers from affiliates of Trintel for approximately $145.0 million, and we invested $55.0 million in FiberTower, a privately held provider of wireless backhaul services, as part of a total of $150.0 million (inclusive of our $55.0 million investment) raised by FiberTower through a private equity offering. We anticipate investing, from time to time on an on going basis, in activities that we believe exhibit potential to achieve our risk adjusted return on investment hurdle rates or exhibit potential to complement our core site rental business, such as our recent purchases of common stock, acquisition of towers and investments in FiberTower and Modeo. Accelerated Vesting of Restricted Common Stock. During 2005, the market performance of our stock appreciated 62% and reached certain target levels for accelerated vesting of restricted stock issued to certain executives and non executive employees in the first quarter of 2004 and 2005. For 2005, the non cash compensation charges totaled $19.9 million in continuing operations, which is inclusive of $13.9 million resulting from the acceleration of the various vestings (including the final two thirds of the restricted common stock issued in the first quarter of 2004, and all of the restricted common stock issued in the first quarter of 2005). We believe that stock awards are an important component of total compensation. Results of Operations Overview Revenue. Our primary sources of revenues are from: (1) renting antenna space on towers, and, to a lesser extent (2) providing network services, including the installation of antennas on our sites. Our site rental revenues are derived from the core businesses we are seeking to grow by increasing the utilization of our existing tower site assets. Typically, these revenues result from long term (five to 10 year) contracts with our customers with renewal terms at the option of the customer. As a result, in any given year approximately 95% of our site rental revenue has been contracted for in a prior year and is of a recurring nature. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements When we discuss growth in this core business, we are generally describing the rate at which we are adding revenues to the previously contracted base, sometimes referred to as the revenue run rate. Site rental revenues in the U.S. and Australia are received primarily from wireless communications companies, including those operating in the following categories of wireless communications: cellular; PCS; ESMR; 3G; wireless data services; and paging. Site rental revenues are generally recognized on a monthly basis under lease agreements, which typically have original terms of five to 10 years (with three or four optional renewal periods of five or 10 years each). See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Accounting and Reporting Matters Critical Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Network services revenues in the U.S. consist of revenues from: (1) antenna installations, substantially all on towers owned or managed by us, (2) site acquisition services, (3) site development and construction, and (4) other services. Network services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies or their agents. Network services revenues in the U.S. are recognized under service contracts which generally provide for billings on a fixed price basis. Demand for our network services fluctuates from period to period and within periods. See Risk Factors. Consequently, the operating results of our network services businesses for any particular period may vary significantly, and should not be considered as indicative of longer term results. Our network services offering is primarily limited to the management of antenna installations on our sites. The network services business is not typically recurring and is largely incidental to our site rental business. It usually has lower margins and is not a key to our future growth. Such activities are generally pursued at the request of a customer in order to facilitate our leasing activities, or otherwise to better serve our customers site requirements. Network services revenues increased as a percentage of our total revenues in 2005, after declining during 2003 and 2004, reflecting the variable nature of the network services business. Costs of Operations. Costs of operations consist primarily of ground leases, repairs and maintenance, utilities, property taxes, employee compensation and related benefit costs, insurance and monitoring costs. Generally, our ground lease agreements are specific to each site and are for an initial term of five years and are renewable for pre determined periods. Ground lease expense is recognized on a monthly basis, regardless of whether the lease agreement payment terms require us to make payments annually, quarterly, or in equal monthly amounts. If the payment terms include fixed escalation provisions, the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight line basis. We calculate the straight line ground lease expense using a time period that equals or exceeds the remaining depreciable life of the tower asset. Further, when a tenant has exercisable renewal options that would compel us to exercise existing ground lease renewal options, we have straight lined the ground lease expense over a sufficient portion of such ground lease renewals to coincide with the final termination of the tenants renewal options. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the expense recognized in a given period represents cash paid in other periods. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Because our tower operating expenses generally do not increase significantly as we add additional customers, once a tower has an anchor customer, additional customers provide significant incremental cash flow. For any given tower, costs of operations are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period. As such, operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as additional customers are added. Costs of operations for network services consist primarily of employee compensation and related benefits costs, subcontractor services, consulting fees, and other on site construction and materials costs. Certain costs incurred in 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements connection with antenna installations are capitalized as property and equipment since they represent assets owned by us. As such, those costs are not included in our results of operations in the year incurred, but rather will be charged to depreciation expense over the life of the assets. Costs associated with contracts not complete at the end of a period are deferred and recognized when the installation becomes operational. Any losses on contracts are recognized at such time as they become known. Non Cash Site Rental Margin. A summary of the non cash portions of our site rental revenues, ground lease expense and resulting impact on our site rental gross margins is as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 (As restated) (As restated) (In thousands of dollars) Non cash portion of site rental revenues: Amounts attributable to rent free periods $ 5,111 $ 6,458 $ 6,971 Amounts attributable to straight line recognition of fixed escalations 16,216 12,740 9,085 Total 21,327 19,198 16,056 Non cash portion of ground lease expense: Amounts attributable to straight line recognition of fixed escalations 19,542 17,529 17,013 Total 19,542 17,529 17,013 Non cash compensation charges 279 553 715 Non cash impact on site rental gross margins: Amounts attributable to rent free periods 5,111 6,458 6,971 Amounts attributable to straight line recognition of fixed escalations (3,326 ) (4,789 ) (7,928 ) Amounts attributable to non cash compensation charges (279 ) (553 ) (715 ) Total $ 1,506 $ 1,116 $ (1,672 ) General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of: employee cash and non cash compensation, training, recruitment and related benefits costs; professional and consulting fees; office rent and related expenses; state franchise taxes; travel costs; and corporate office expenses. Corporate Development Expenses. Corporate development expenses represent costs incurred in connection with acquisitions and development of new business initiatives. These expenses consist primarily of: compensation and related benefits costs; external professional fees; and other costs directly related to new business initiatives. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion. Depreciation, amortization and accretion charges relate to our property and equipment (which consists primarily of towers, associated buildings, construction equipment and vehicles) and other intangible assets. Depreciation of towers is generally computed with a useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease (including optional renewal periods). See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Amortization of other intangible assets (the value of certain site rental contracts at our U.S. operations (CCUSA)) is computed with a useful life of 10 years. Depreciation of buildings is generally computed with useful lives ranging from 20 to 40 years. Depreciation of construction equipment and vehicles is generally computed with useful lives of 10 years and 5 years, respectively. Discontinued Operations. On June 28, 2004, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our UK subsidiary, CCUK, to an affiliate of National Grid. CCUKs assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows are classified as amounts from discontinued operations. On August 31, 2004, we completed the sale of CCUK. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In January 2005, we adopted a plan to exit the business of OpenCell. For all periods presented, the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of the business of OpenCell are classified as amounts from discontinued operations. On May 9, 2005, we sold OpenCell to a company in the business of developing and manufacturing wireless equipment, including distributed antenna systems. As part of the transaction, we entered into a product procurement arrangement that permits us to continue the purchase of equipment for our distributed antenna activities. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements Our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004 have been restated to reflect the correction of errors for certain non cash items related to our lease accounting practices. The SEC issued a public letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts in early 2005 clarifying its interpretation of existing accounting literature applicable to certain leases and leasehold improvements. In March 2005, as a result of such clarification, we adjusted (both retroactively and prospectively) our method of accounting for tenant leases, ground leases, and depreciation and restated our prior financial statements as reported in its Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2004 to reflect the corrections of errors for certain non cash items relating to our lease accounting practices. As noted in our Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the period ended September 30, 2005, we engaged in a lease by lease review of the leases impacted by this clarification. Upon completion of the review, we have determined that certain non cash adjustments should be recorded. The aggregate net amount of these recorded non cash adjustments, relating to periods prior to October 1, 2005, is an improvement to net income (loss) of approximately $19.9 million. These non cash adjustments reflect the cumulative difference between the amounts previously recorded in our financial statements and those amounts determined in the lease by lease review. The corrections to our consolidated results of operations consist of non cash adjustments attributable to decreases in site rental revenues, ground lease expense (included in site rental costs of operations) and depreciation expense (included in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense). Since the adjustments affected results of operations at CCAL and our two joint ventures with Verizon, they also resulted in changes to minority interests and the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of a minority interest in 2003 and 2004. We believe the impacts of these non cash adjustments are not material to any previously issued financial statement. However, the cumulative adjustments required to correct these errors would be material to the fourth quarter of 2005 if taken as a single adjustment in that quarter. Therefore, we have determined that the errors are most appropriately corrected through the restatement of previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2004, for each of the quarters of 2004 and for the first three quarters of 2005 to reflect these non cash adjustments in the proper periods. The cumulative effects of these adjustments on our consolidated statements of operations from inception through September 30, 2005 are as follows: a decrease in site rental revenues of $0.7 million; a decrease in site rental costs of operations of $12.1 million; a decrease in depreciation expense of $12.1 million; a decrease in operating losses of $23.4 million; a decrease in other expense (attributable to the loss on the issuance of an interest in Crown Atlantic) of $0.1 million; a decrease in minority interest of $3.7 million; and a decrease in net losses of $19.9 million. These adjustments have no effect on our credit (provision) for income taxes since the net impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities is offset by changes in valuation allowances. In addition, incremental non cash compensation expense ($0.9 million) was charged to general and administrative expenses in the results of operations in 2005 and certain non cash compensation expense (totaling $1.5 million) previously charged to results of operations during 2005 related to our former CCUK employees was charged to the net gain on disposal of CCUK. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the restatement. The adjustments do not affect historical or future cash flow or the timing of payments under related leases. Moreover, the non cash adjustments are not expected to have any impact on cash balances, compliance with any financial covenant or debt instrument, or the current economic value of our leaseholds and our towers. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The following information is derived from our historical consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated: Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2004 Year EndedDecember 31, 2005 Amount Percent of NetRevenues Amount Percentof NetRevenues DollarChange PercentageChange (As restated) (As restated) (In thousands of dollars) Net revenues: Site rental $ 538,309 89.1 % $ 597,125 88.2 % $ 58,816 10.9 % Network services and other 65,893 10.9 % 79,634 11.8 % 13,741 20.9 % Total net revenues 604,202 100.0 % 676,759 100.0 % 72,557 12.0 % Operating expenses: Costs of operations (exclusive of depreciation, amortization and accretion): Site rental 184,273 34.2 % 197,355 33.1 % 13,082 7.1 % Network services and other 46,752 71.0 % 54,630 68.6 % 7,878 16.8 % Total costs of operations 231,025 38.2 % 251,985 37.2 % 20,960 9.1 % General and administrative 97,665 16.2 % 105,763 15.6 % 8,098 8.3 % Corporate development 1,455 0.2 % 3,896 0.6 % 2,441 167.7 % Restructuring charges 3,729 0.6 % 8,477 1.3 % 4,748 127.3 % Asset write down charges 7,652 1.3 % 2,925 0.4 % (4,727 ) (61.8 )% Depreciation, amortization and accretion 284,991 47.2 % 281,118 41.6 % (3,873 ) (1.4 )% Operating income (loss) (22,315 ) (3.7 )% 22,595 3.3 % 44,910 201.3 % Other income (expense): Interest and other income (expense) (78,264 ) (13.0 )% (282,443 ) (41.7 )% (204,179 ) * Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs (206,770 ) (34.2 )% (133,806 ) (19.8 )% 72,964 * Loss from continuing operations before income taxes, minority interests and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (307,349 ) (50.9 )% (393,654 ) (58.2 )% (86,305 ) * Benefit (provision) for income taxes 5,370 0.9 % (3,225 ) (0.5 )% (8,595 ) * Minority interests 398 3,525 0.5 % 3,127 * Loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (301,581 ) (50.0 )% (393,354 ) (58.2 )% (91,773 ) * Discontinued operations: Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 40,578 6.7 % (1,953 ) (0.2 )% (42,531 ) * Net gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax 494,110 81.9 % 2,801 0.3 % (491,309 ) * Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 534,688 88.6 % 848 0.1 % (533,840 ) * Income (loss) before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 233,107 38.6 % (392,506 ) (58.1 )% (625,613 ) * Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations (9,031 ) (1.2 )% (9,031 ) * Net income (loss) $ 233,107 38.6 % $ (401,537 ) (59.3 )% $ (634,644 ) * *: Percentage is not meaningful Site rental revenues for 2005 were $597.1 million, an increase of $58.8 million, or 10.9%, from 2004. Of this increase, $51.4 million, or 87.4%, was attributable to CCUSA and $7.2 million, or 12.2%, was attributable to CCAL. The revenue growth was primarily driven by site rental revenues from new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) in 2005 on existing towers and, to a lesser extent, (1) contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations, (2) new sites built or acquired in 2005, and (3) renewal of certain leases and associated step up in the straight line rents. Network services and other revenues for 2005 were $79.6 million, an increase of $13.7 million, or 20.9%, from 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to a $11.2 million increase from CCUSA, and a $2.8 million increase from CCAL, and reflects the variable nature of the network services business as these revenues are typically not under long term contract. Site rental costs of operations for 2005 were $197.4 million, an increase of $13.1 million from 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to cost increases of $10.9 million for CCUSA and $1.6 million for CCAL. Such cost increases relate to normal and customary increases in ground rentals on leases with variable escalations, repairs and maintenance, employee compensation and related benefits, property taxes and $2.9 million of operating costs related to the towers acquired from Trintel in August 2005. Network services and other costs of operations for 2005 were $54.6 million, an increase of $7.9 million from 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to an $8.0 million increase in costs from CCUSA and a $0.2 million increase in costs from CCAL. 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Site rental gross margins increased by $45.7 million, or 12.9% to $399.8 million, or 66.9% of site rental revenues for 2005, from $354.0 million, or 65.8% of site rental revenues for 2004. The $45.7 million incremental margin represents 77.8% of the related increase in site rental revenues for 2005, reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers. General and administrative expenses were $105.8 million, or 15.6% of total net revenues, including $18.8 million of non cash compensation charges for 2005, an increase of $8.1 million from $97.7 million, or 16.2% of total net revenues, including $12.3 million of non cash compensation charges from 2004. Non cash compensation charges increased $6.5 million as a result of accelerated vesting of shares of restricted common stock based on performance of our stock in 2005. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Compensation Charges Related to Stock Awards. Corporate development expenses for 2005 were $3.9 million, an increase of $2.4 million from $1.5 million for 2004. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salary costs related to Modeo within Emerging Businesses. As a result of the sale of CCUK, we consolidated certain corporate management functions in 2004 and 2005. During 2005, we recorded cash and non cash restructuring charges of $8.5 million, compared to $3.7 million for 2004. Such 2005 charges related primarily to employee severance payments and modification of stock compensation awards. The 2004 and 2005 restructuring charges included non cash compensation charges of $2.9 million and $6.4 million, respectively. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges. During 2005, we recorded asset write down charges of $2.9 million, compared to $7.7 million for 2004. Such non cash charges related to the abandonment or disposal of certain towers and towers in development. We may record such charges in the future if conditions warrant. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we performed our annual update of the impairment test for goodwill. The results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired at any of our reporting units. Depreciation, amortization and accretion for 2005 was $281.1 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 1.4% from 2004. This decrease was primarily attributable to the portfolio extension program in the U.S., which is designed to either purchase the land on which our towers reside or renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases, subleases, and licenses relating to the sites on which our U.S. towers are located, partially offset by: (1) the acquisition of 467 towers from Trintel, and (2) an increase in our tower assets as a result of capital expenditures for the construction, modification and maintenance of tower assets (See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of our capital expenditures). Interest and other income (expense) for 2005 resulted primarily from: (1) losses of $283.8 million from purchases of our debt securities (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources). These financing transactions were completed to lower our future cash interest payments and simplify our capital structure, (2) $4.7 million from our share of losses incurred by unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by (3) interest income from invested cash balances and gains on the sale of assets. Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2005 was $133.8 million, a decrease of $73.0 million, or 35.3%, from 2004. This decrease was primarily attributable to the purchases and repayments of outstanding debt during 2004 and 2005. These financing transactions were completed to lower our future cash interest payments and simplify our capital structure. The reductions in outstanding debt during 2004 included (1) 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements $1.3 billion for CCOCs former credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (2000 Credit Facility), which was repaid in August 2004 via proceeds from the sale of CCUK and (2) $48.0 million of 4% Convertible Senior Notes via purchases in December 2004. The reductions in outstanding debt during 2005 included $1.6 billion purchase of notes and $180.0 million repayment on the Crown Atlantic Credit Facility, partially offset by $295.0 million in borrowings under the 2005 Credit Facility (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities). Minority interests represent the minority shareholders 22.4% interest in the CCAL operations and, through November 4, 2004, Verizons 37.245% interest in Crown Atlantics operations. On November 4, 2004, we acquired the remaining 37.245% equity interest in Crown Atlantic. Income from discontinued operations in 2005 represents the loss from operations of OpenCell and the net gain on sale of OpenCell. Income from discontinued operations in 2004 primarily relates to the results from operations of CCUK and the net gain on sale of CCUK. The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations represents the charge recorded upon adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations An interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Accounting and Reporting Matters Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards for more information). Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Operating Segments See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the financial results for our operating segments. Our reportable operating segments for 2005 are (1) US tower operations, or CCUSA, (2) Australian tower operations, or CCAL, (3) Emerging Businesses and (4) Corporate Office and Other. Our financial results are reported to management and the Board of Directors in this manner. Prior to its sale in June 2004, CCUK, our UK tower and broadcasting operations, was a reportable segment. For all periods presented, CCUK has been classified as a component of Corporate Office and Other on a discontinued operations basis. We have pursued and are currently pursuing emerging strategic opportunities and adjacent businesses, including Modeo and Crown Castle Solutions. These businesses have been reclassified to the segment Emerging Businesses. Modeo had previously been reported within the Corporate Office and Other segment, while Crown Castle Solutions had previously been reported within the CCUSA segment. These changes in reportable segments were effective for the three months ended March 31, 2005, and segment information for all periods presented has been reclassified. Our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (Adjusted EBITDA). Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the tower sector, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, minority interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, interest and other income (expense), depreciation, amortization and accretion, operating non cash compensation charges, asset write down charges and restructuring charges (credits). Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is discussed further under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Accounting and Reporting Matters Non GAAP Financial Measures. CCUSA. Net revenues for 2005 were $621.9 million, a net increase of $62.5 million, or 11.2 %, from 2004. Of the $62.5 million overall increase in net revenues, $51.4 million relates to site rental revenues. The $51.4 million 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements increase in site rental revenues for 2005 was primarily driven by new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on our towers and, to a lesser extent, (1) contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations, (2) new towers acquired or built since the end of the third quarter of 2004 and (3) renewal of certain leases and associated step up in the straight line rents. This increase represents approximately 87.4% of the consolidated increase in site rental revenues for this same period. As mentioned previously, more than 95% of our site rental revenue has been contracted for in a prior year. Network services revenues total $72.5 million for 2005 should continue to be somewhat volatile as these revenues are typically not under long term contract. General and administrative expenses were $61.5 million, or 9.9% of total net revenues, including $6.9 million of non cash compensation charges for 2005, an increase of $2.0 million from $59.5 million, or 10.6% of total net revenues, including $6.4 million of non cash compensation charges for 2004. Non cash compensation charges increased $0.5 million primarily as a result of accelerated vesting of shares of restricted common stock based on the performance of our stock during 2005 (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Compensation Charges Related to Stock Awards). Adjusted EBITDA for 2005 was $339.5 million representing a net increase of $42.3 million, or 14.2% from 2004. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the high incremental margin from new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on existing towers. More specifically, site rental gross margins increased by $40.5 million, or 12.3% to $370.3 million, or 67.4% of site rental revenues for 2005 from 66.2% of site rental revenues for 2004. The $40.5 million incremental margin represents 78.8% of the related increase in site rental revenues, reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers. Operating income for 2005 was $76.0 million, a net increase of $50.2 million from 2004. The increase in operating income is primarily driven by the $40.5 million increase in site rental gross margin. Net income (loss) for 2005 was $7.1 million, an increase of $47.6 million from 2004. The increase in net income (loss) is primarily driven by: (1) the $40.5 million increase in site rental gross margin; and (2) the $14.8 million improvement in interest and other income (expense) as a result of a $13.9 million loss on the repayment of the 2000 Credit Facility in 2004 (not repeated in 2005); partially offset by (3) an $11.0 million increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs as a result of incremental interest charges related to the $1.9 billion Tower Revenue Notes issued in June 2005 with a weighted average interest rate of 4.890% and borrowings under the 2005 Credit Facility and reductions in interest charges as a result of the repayment of the 2000 Credit Facility during the third quarter of 2004 and the reduction of the Crown Atlantic Credit Facility via regular payments throughout 2004 and 2005 up to the repayment date in early June 2005 (see also note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt transactions); and (4) $7.9 million incremental expense from the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Accounting and Reporting Matters Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards for further discussion of FIN 47). See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation from net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. CCAL. Total net revenues for 2005 were $54.6 million, a net increase of $9.9 million, or 22.3% from 2004. Approximately 70% of this increase relates to growth in site rental revenues, with the remaining approximately 30% related to growth in service revenues. The site rental revenue growth was primarily driven by new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on our towers and, to a lesser extent, contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations. Our site rental revenues included a contractual payment of $2.1 million and $2.1 million for 2004 and 2005, respectively, related to a fee for the shortfall in contractually committed licenses. Adjusted EBITDA for 2005 was $22.1 million, a net increase of $7.3 million or 49.0% from 2004. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the incremental margin from the new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on existing towers. Site rental gross margins increased by $5.6 million, or 23.1% to $29.8 million, or 62.7% of site rental revenues for 2005 from $24.2 million, or 60.0% for 2004. The $5.6 million incremental margin represents 78.1% of the related increase in site rental revenues, reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers. 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating loss for 2005 was $5.7 million, an improvement of $6.7 million from 2004. The improvement in operating income is primarily due to the $5.6 million increase in gross margin from site rental revenues and the $2.6 million increase in gross margin from network service revenues, offset by a $1.2 million increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of increased employee related costs. Net loss for 2005 was $7.0 million, an improvement of $5.3 million from 2004. The decrease in net loss is primarily driven by the aforementioned factors that resulted in the operating loss improvement. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. The increases and decreases between 2005 and 2004 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the changes between these two periods. Emerging Businesses. Net revenues for 2005 were $0.3 million. Emerging Businesses represent new strategic opportunities, or adjacent businesses, which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to achieve our risk adjusted return on investment hurdle rates or exhibit potential to complement our core site rental business. Because these businesses are in the earlier stages of development, significant revenues have not been realized during 2004 and 2005. Modeo is pursuing a potential offering of a DVB H service to capitalize on our U.S. nationwide license relating to five megahertz of spectrum in the 1670 1675 MHz band. Modeo has launched a test network of its DVB H technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and is developing networks in certain select U.S. cities, including New York City. Modeo had no revenues for 2004 and 2005. Crown Castle Solutions offers hub based, low visibility distributed antenna systems which are attractive alternatives to a traditional tower site in areas where zoning or densities make a tower unfeasible. Distributed antenna systems are particularly useful in areas with challenging zoning regulations or other impediments to traditional towers. Base stations can be located up to 10 miles away and connected to the distributed antenna system via fiber optic cable. Each antenna location in the distributed antenna network provides coverage in a radius of approximately one half mile. Crown Castle Solutions had revenues of $0.2 million and $0.3 million for 2004 and 2005, respectively. The operating loss and net loss of $9.9 million and negative Adjusted EBITDA of $8.3 million for 2005 is approximately split equally between the operating losses associated with Crown Castle Solutions and the operating costs of Modeo. Corporate Office and Other. General and administrative expenses were $28.8 million, including $10.7 million of non cash compensation charges for 2005, an increase of $5.4 million from $23.4 million, including $5.8 million of non cash compensation charges for 2004. Non cash compensation charges increased $4.9 million primarily as a result of accelerated vesting of shares of restricted common stock based on the performance of our stock during 2005 (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Compensation Charges Related to Stock Awards). Negative Adjusted EBITDA for 2005 was $18.3 million, an improvement of $0.8 million, or 4.2% from 2004. The negative Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the consolidation of certain corporate management functions. Net loss for 2005 was $391.8 million, compared to net income of $292.2 million for 2004. The reduction in net income of $684.0 million is primarily the result of $539.0 million income from discontinued operations of CCUK, including the $494.1 million net gain on sale of CCUK in 2004 (not repeated in 2005), and $288.8 million other expense, an increase in other expense of $220.2 million, due to (1) the purchases of $1.5 billion combined face value of the 4% Convertible Senior Notes, 10 3/4% senior notes due 2011 (10 3/4% Senior Notes), 9 3/8% senior notes due 2011 (9 3/8% Senior Notes) , 7.5% senior notes due 2013 (7.5% Senior Notes), and 7.5% Series B senior notes due 2013 (7.5% Series B Senior Notes) in 2005, which resulted in a loss of $281.1 million for 2005, (2) the 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements redemption of the combined $52.9 million of 9% senior notes due 2011 (9% Senior Notes), 9 1/2% senior notes due 2011 (9 1/2% Senior Notes), 10 3/8% senior discount notes due 2011 (10 3/8% Discount Notes), and 11 1/4% senior discount notes due 2011 (11 1/4% Discount Notes) resulting in a loss of $2.7 million, (3) $4.9 million from our share of losses incurred by unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by a $83.5 million reduction in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs to $65.2 million driven by the resultant lower interest expense from the aforementioned purchases, redemptions, and repayment of long term debt in 2004 and 2005. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA.

Of this increase, $43.5 million was attributable to CCUSA and $10.0 million was attributable to CCAL. Network services and other revenues for 2004 were $65.9 million, a decrease of $6.4 million from 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $7.4 million decrease from CCUSA and a $0.8 million increase from CCAL. Total revenues for 2004 were $604.2 million, a net increase of $47.0 million from 2003. The revenue growth was primarily driven by site rental revenues from (1) new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) in 2004 on existing towers (2) contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations, (3) new sites built or acquired in 2004, and (4) renewal of certain leases and associated step up in the straight line rents. The decrease in network services and other revenues from CCUSA reflects a continuation of our strategic decision made in 2002 to reduce our network services offering to primarily the management of antenna installations on our sites. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Site rental costs of operations for 2004 were $184.3 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 2.8% from 2003. Of this increase, $1.4 million was attributable to CCUSA and $3.6 million was attributable to CCAL. Network services and other costs of operations for 2004 were $46.8 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.3% from 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $2.9 million decrease in costs from CCUSA, partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in costs from CCAL and a $1.8 million increase in costs from Emerging Businesses. Total costs of operations for 2004 were $231.0 million, a net increase of $4.8 million from 2003. Gross margins (net revenues less costs of operations) for site rental as a percentage of site rental revenues increased to 65.8% for 2004 from 63.0% for 2003 because of the high incremental margin on the related increase in site rental revenue, which reflects the relatively fixed costs to operate our towers. Gross margins for network services and other as a percentage of network services and other revenues decreased to 29.1% for 2004 from 35.2% for 2003 reflecting the variable nature of the service business. General and administrative expenses for 2004 were $97.7 million, an increase of $2.5 million, or 2.6%, from 2003. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1) a $2.8 million increase in expenses at CCAL; (2) a $4.0 million increase in expenses at Emerging Businesses; and (3) a $1.0 million increase in expenses at our corporate office segment, partially offset by (4) a $5.3 million decrease in expenses related to the CCUSA operations, related primarily to lower staffing levels after the recent restructurings. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 16.2% for 2004 from 17.1% for 2003, primarily due to stable overhead costs as compared to increasing revenues for CCUSA. General and administrative expenses are inclusive of non cash charges of $12.3 million and $13.6 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Corporate development expenses for 2004 were $1.5 million, compared to $5.6 million for 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in salary costs related to corporate activities. During 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $3.7 million, compared to $1.3 million for 2003. Such charges relate primarily to employee severance payments and non cash compensation charges in connection with the modification of stock options and restricted stock awards. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges. During 2004, we recorded asset write down charges of $7.7 million, compared to $14.3 million for 2003. Such non cash charges related to the abandonment of a portion of our construction in process and the write down of certain other assets. We may record such charges in the future if conditions warrant. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges. Depreciation, amortization and accretion for 2004 was $285.0 million, an increase of $4.0 million, or 1.4% from 2003. This increase was primarily attributable to: (1) a $3.1 million increase in depreciation from CCUSA; and (2) a $1.4 million increase in depreciation from CCAL, partially offset by (3) a $0.9 million decrease in depreciation from corporate office and other. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Interest and other income (expense) for 2004 resulted primarily from: (1) losses of approximately $63.8 million from purchases of our debt securities (see also note 7 to our consolidated financial statements). These financing transactions were completed to lower our future cash interest payments and simplify our capital structure; (2) a loss of $13.9 million from the repayment of our 2000 Credit Facility (see also note 7 to our consolidated financial statements); and (3) $5.7 million from our share of losses incurred by unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by (4) interest income from invested cash balances. Interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and dividends on preferred stock for 2004 was $206.8 million, a decrease of $52.0 million, or 20.1%, from 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to: (1) purchases and redemptions of our debt securities in 2003 and 2004 (see also note 7 to our consolidated financial statements); (2) reductions in outstanding indebtedness under the Crown Atlantic Credit Facility, partially offset by (3) the issuance of the 4% Convertible Senior Notes, the 7.5% Senior Notes and the 7.5% Series B Senior Notes in 2003; and (4) an increase in outstanding bank indebtedness at CCUSA in 2003, the proceeds of which were used to retire CCUKs indebtedness and purchase certain of our public debt and preferred stock. The credit for income taxes of $5.4 million for 2004 consists primarily of a non cash deferred tax asset resulting from an alternative minimum tax carryforward, which allowed for the reduction in the valuation allowance, partially offset by a non cash deferred tax liability resulting from a difference between the book and tax basis of CCUSAs goodwill. Minority interests represent the minority partners interest in the operations of Crown Atlantic (43.1% through April 30, 2003, 37.245% from May 1, 2003 through November 4, 2004 and none thereafter), the minority partners interest in the operations of Crown Castle GT (17.8% through April 30, 2003 and none thereafter) and the minority shareholders 22.4% interest in the CCAL operations. Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Operating Segments See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular presentation of the financial results for our operating segments. CCUSA. Net revenues for 2004 were $559.4 million, a net increase of $36.1 million, or 6.9%, from 2003. Of the $36.1 million overall increase in net revenues, $43.5 million relates to an increase in site rental revenues, offset by a $7.5 million decrease in network services and other revenues. The $43.5 million increase in site rental revenues for 2004 compared to 2003 reflects (1) new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on our towers, (2) contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations, and (3) renewal of certain leases and associated step up in the straight line rents. This increase represented approximately 81.4% of the consolidated increase in site rental revenues for this same period. In 2004, the rate of new tenant additions on our U.S. towers was approximately 38% greater than the comparable period in 2003. As discussed in the management overview, we believe that site rental revenues may increase as additional tenants are added to, or modifications are made to existing installations on, our tower assets. We expect network services revenues should continue to be somewhat volatile as a percentage of total net revenues as these revenues are typically not under long term contract. Adjusted EBITDA for 2004 was $297.2 million, representing a net increase of $42.0 million, or 16.5%, from 2003. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the high incremental margin from new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on existing towers. More specifically, site rental gross margins increased by $42.1 million, or 14.6%, to $329.8 million, or 66.2% of site rental revenues for 2004 from 63.3% of site rental revenues for 2003. The $42.1 million incremental margin represents 96.8% of the related increase in site rental revenues, reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers. Operating income for 2004 was $25.8 million, a net increase of $48.0 million from 2003. The increase in operating income is primarily driven by the $42.1 million increase in site rental gross margin, reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Net loss for 2004 was $40.5 million, a reduction of $53.5 million from 2003. The reduction in net loss is primarily driven by: (1) the $42.1 million increase in site rental gross margin; and (2) the benefit for income taxes of $6.0 million for 2004, an improvement of $8.0 million from 2003, which consists primarily of the aforementioned non cash deferred tax asset resulting from an alternative minimum tax carryforward, which allowed for the reduction in the valuation allowance, partially offset by a non cash deferred tax liability resulting from a difference between the book and tax basis of CCUSAs goodwill. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. CCAL. Total net revenues for 2004 were $44.6 million, a net increase of $10.8 million, or 31.9%, from 2003. Of this increase, $10.0 million relates to growth in site rental revenues, with the remainder related to growth in network services and other revenues. The site rental revenue growth reflects the new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on our towers and contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations. In 2004, the rate of new tenant additions on CCALs towers was approximately 67% greater than the comparable period in 2003. Our site rental revenues included a contractual payment of $2.1 million and $2.1 million for 2003 and 2004, respectively, related to a fee for the customer contractual committed number of site licenses less the amount actually utilized. Adjusted EBITDA for 2004 was $14.8 million, a net increase of $3.6 million, or 31.6%, from 2003. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the incremental margin from the new tenant additions (or modifications to existing installations) on existing towers. Site rental gross margins increased by $6.4 million, or 35.7%, to $24.2 million, or 60.0% of site rental revenues for 2004 from $17.8 million, or 58.7% of site rental revenues for 2003. The $6.4 million incremental margin represents 63.9% of the related increase in site rental revenues, reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers. Operating loss for 2004 improved to $12.4 million, a net decrease of $2.1 million from 2003. The reduction in operating loss is primarily due to the $6.4 million increase in gross margin from site rental revenues offset by the $0.1 million decrease in gross margin from network service revenues, and by a $2.8 million increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of headcount additions. Net loss for 2004 was $12.3 million, an increase of $0.3 million from 2003. The increase in net loss is primarily driven by the aforementioned factors that resulted in the reduction of the operating loss, combined with a $1.4 million increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion. The increases and decreases between 2004 and 2003 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the changes between these two periods. Emerging Businesses. Net revenues for 2004 were $0.2 million. Modeo had no revenues for 2003 and 2004. Crown Castle Solutions had revenues of $0.0 million and $0.2 million for 2003 and 2004, respectively. The operating loss and net loss of $6.3 million and negative Adjusted EBITDA of $5.8 million for 2004 primarily consists of the (1) operating losses associated with Crown Castle Solutions and, to a lesser extent, (2) operating costs of Modeo. Corporate Office and Other. General and administrative expenses for 2004 were $23.4 million, a $1.0 million increase from 2003. The increase relates to salary and related benefits increases. Corporate development expenses totaled $1.5 million, a decrease of $4.1 million from 2003. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in salary costs related to corporate activities. Net income for 2004 was $292.2 million, an improvement of $637.4 million from 2003. The improvement in net income is primarily driven by: (1) The $539.0 million income from discontinued operations of CCUK, including the $494.1 million gain on sale of CCUK, recognized in 2004; 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (2) a $51.3 million reduction in interest expense, amortization and deferred financing costs and dividends on preferred stock attributable to purchases and redemptions of our debt securities in 2003 and 2004, partially offset by the issuance of the 4% Convertible Senior Notes, the 7.5% Senior Notes and the 7.5% Series B Senior Notes in 2003 (see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of debt purchases and issuances); partially offset by; (3) a $51.8 million reduction in interest and other expense. The 2004 amount was primarily attributable to losses on debt purchases of approximately $63.8 million. Restructuring Charges and Asset Write Down Charges In October 2002, we announced a restructuring of our U.S. business in order to flatten its organizational structure to better align with customer demand and enhance our regional focus to improve customer service. As part of the restructuring, we reduced our U.S. workforce by approximately 230 employees and closed some smaller offices. In connection with this restructuring, we recorded cash charges of approximately $6.1 million. The continued execution of the October 2002 restructuring plan lead to further headcount reductions in the U.S. business during the second quarter of 2003. As a result, we reduced our U.S. workforce by approximately 60 employees (approximately 9%) and initiated efforts to sublease vacated office space at two of our locations. In connection with this restructuring, we recorded cash charges of approximately $2.3 million. As a result of the sale of CCUK, in December 2004 and January 2005 we consolidated certain corporate management functions. In connection with this restructuring, we recorded cash charges of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2005. We also recorded non cash general and administrative compensation charges for the modification of stock awards for certain executives totaling $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we abandoned a portion of our construction in process and certain other assets and recorded asset write down charges of $14.3 million for CCUSA. During the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, we recorded asset write down charges of $7.7 million and $2.4 million, respectively, for CCUSA and $ 0 and $0.6 million, respectively, for CCAL. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding restructuring charges and asset write down charges. Compensation Charges Related to Stock Awards On January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value method of accounting (using the prospective method of transition) for stock based employee compensation awards granted on or after that date. As a result, we are recognizing non cash compensation charges for stock options granted in 2003. Such charges will amount to approximately $0.6 million over a five year period ending in 2008. During the first quarter of 2003, we granted approximately 5.8 million shares of restricted common stock to our executives and certain employees. These restricted shares had a weighted average grant date fair value of $4.15 per share, determined based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant dates. The restrictions on these shares were to expire in various annual amounts over the vesting period of five years, with provisions for accelerated vesting based on the market performance of our common stock. In connection with these restricted shares, we were to recognize non cash compensation charges of approximately $24.0 million over the vesting period. On April 27, 2004, the market performance of our common stock reached the third and final target level for accelerated vesting. In 2003 and 2004, non cash compensation charges totaling a combined $20.5 million were recognized as a result of accelerated vesting. In March, April and May 2004, we granted approximately 1.3 million shares of restricted common stock to approximately 500 of our employees (including approximately 175 employees of CCUK). These restricted shares had a weighted average grant date fair value of $13.99 per share, determined based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant dates. The restrictions on the shares were to expire in various annual amounts over the vesting period of four years, with provisions for accelerated vesting based on the market performance of our common stock. In connection with these restricted shares, we were to recognize non cash compensation charges of approximately $18.8 million over the vesting period (inclusive of amounts related to former CCUK employees). On 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements September 16, 2005, the market performance of our common stock reached the third and final target level for accelerated vesting. In 2004 and 2005, non cash compensation charges totaling a combined $7.4 million were recognized as a result of accelerated vesting. In February 2005, we granted 317,005 shares of restricted common stock to certain of our executives. The restrictions on the shares were to expire in various amounts over the vesting period of four years if the market performance of our common stock reached certain levels, with additional provisions for accelerated vesting based on the market performance of our common stock. In connection with these restricted shares, we were to recognize non cash compensation charges of approximately $6.4 million over the vesting period. On November 29, 2005, the market performance of our common stock reached the third and final target level for accelerated vesting. In 2005, non cash compensation charges totaling a combined $5.5 million were recognized as a result of accelerated vesting. In February, March and April 2005, we granted a total of 376,901 shares of restricted common stock to certain of our non executive employees. These restricted shares had a weighted average grant date fair value of $16.16 per share, determined based on the closing market price of the common stock on the grant dates. The restrictions on the shares were to expire in various annual amounts over the vesting period of four years, with provisions for accelerated vesting based on the market performance of the common stock. In connection with these restricted shares, we were to recognize non cash compensation charges of approximately $6.1 million over the vesting period. On November 29, 2005, the market performance of our common stock reached the third and final target level for accelerated vesting. In 2005, non cash compensation charges totaling a combined $4.8 million were recognized as a result of accelerated vesting. A summary of accelerated vesting charges recorded in continuing operations, by year, for the restricted common stock issued in years 2003, 2004, and 2005 is as follows: Grant Year Grant Recipients Early Vesting Date Accelerated Vesting Charge for the Year Ended, 2003 2004 2005 Total (In thousands of dollars) 2003 Executives and non executive employees April 29, 2003 $ 7,317 $ $ $ 7,317 July 30, 2003 7,825 7,825 April 27, 2004 5,378 5,378 $ 15,142 $ 5,378 $ $ 20,520 2004 Executives and non executive employees October 27, 2004 $ $ 2,495 $ $ 2,495 July 19, 2005 1,957 1,957 September 16, 2005 2.993 2,993 $ $ 2,495 $ 4,950 $ 7,445 2005 Executives July 19, 2005 $ $ $ 1,570 $ 1,570 August 30, 2005 1,962 1,962 November 29, 2005 1,943 1,943 $ $ $ 5,475 $ 5,475 2005 Non executive employees July 19, 2005 $ $ $ 1,312 $ 1,312 August 30, 2005 1,874 1,874 November 29, 2005 1,603 1,603 $ $ $ 4,789 $ 4,789 Total Accelerated Vesting Charge $ 15,142 $ 7,873 $ 15,214 $ 38,229 See also note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these and other stock based compensation awards. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Strategy. We seek to allocate our available capital among the investment alternatives that we believe provide the greatest risk adjusted returns given current market conditions. As such, we may continue to: (1) acquire sites, extend leaseholds on existing sites, acquire land on which our towers are located, build new towers and make improvements to existing towers, (2) make investments in emerging businesses that are complementary to our core site leasing business when the expected returns from such investments meet our investment return criteria; and (3) utilize a portion of our available cash balances and debt capacity to purchase our own stock (either common or preferred) or debt securities from time to time as market prices make such investments attractive. Our goal is to maximize net cash from operating activities and fund all non discretionary capital spending and debt service from our operating cash flow, without reliance on additional borrowing or the use of our cash. However, due to risk factors, including those set forth herein and in Risk Factors, there can be no assurance that this will be possible. As part of our strategy to achieve increases in net cash from operating activities, in addition to improving operating results, we have lowered interest rates on debt through attractive refinancing opportunities. We may also incur additional indebtedness on a discretionary basis to fund discretionary investments. Our business strategy contemplates discretionary investments in connection with the further improvement and selective expansion of our existing tower portfolios. During 2006, we expect that the majority of our discretionary investments will occur in connection with strategic tower acquisitions, the addition of new tenants on our existing sites, purchases of land under our towers, selected new tower builds and investments in adjacent businesses, including the emerging businesses and the repurchases of common stock. We issued $1.9 billion in Tower Revenue Notes through certain of our subsidiaries during June 2005. The notes are rated investment grade, have a weighted average interest rate of 4.89% and are secured by the personal property, license agreements, revenues and or distributions related to our towers located in the U.S. as of June 2005. Periodically, beginning in 2006, we contemplate issuing additional notes under a similar structure to the existing Tower Revenue Notes, in order to leverage anticipated growth in our site rental business. The proceeds from issuances of additional notes would be available for general corporate purposes. Liquidity Position. As of December 31, 2005, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $65.4 million (exclusive of restricted cash of $95.8 million), consolidated long term and short term debt of $2,270.7 million, consolidated redeemable preferred stock of $311.9 million and consolidated stockholders equity of $1,178.4 million. We also had $30.0 million of availability under our 2005 Credit Facility. Common Stock and Convertible Purchases. During 2005, we purchased 16.0 million shares of common stock, exclusive of shares of common stock purchased from the dividend paying agent following the issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock dividend, at an average price of $19.44, utilizing $310.1 million in cash to affect these purchases. These purchases of common stock in 2005, combined with purchases of additional 4% Convertible Senior Notes and all of the 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock during 2005, reduced outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2004 by 16.0 million, or 7.1%, and potential future outstanding shares as of December 31, 2004 by an additional 18.3 million. Consistent with our strategy, we may elect to make similar purchases of common stock and convertible instruments in the future. Net Cash from Operations A summary of our net cash provided by operating activities (from our consolidated statement of cash flows) is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2003 2004 2005 (In thousands of dollars) Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ 85,324 $ 118,322 $ 204,496 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The net cash provided by operating activities for 2005 increased by $86.2 million from 2004 due primarily to growth in our core site leasing, a decrease in cash interest paid and a decrease in trade receivables. Changes in working capital, and particularly changes in accrued interest, can have a dramatic impact on our net cash from operating activities for interim periods, largely due to the timing of interest payments on our various notes issues. Investing Activities Capital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures can be separated into two general categories: (1) sustaining (which includes maintenance activities on our sites, vehicles, information technology equipment and office equipment), and (2) revenue generating (which includes tower improvements, enhancements to the structural capacity of our towers in order to support additional leasing, the construction of new towers and distributed antenna systems, land purchases and investment in emerging businesses). A summary of our capital expenditures (including the total capital expenditures, which can be found on our consolidated statement of cash flows) is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Sustaining CapitalExpenditures Revenue GeneratingCapital Expenditures Total CapitalExpenditures 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 (In thousands of dollars) CCUSA $ 8,225 $ 11,821 $ 29,455 $ 33,976 $ 37,680 $ 45,797 CCAL 1,184 1,877 1,498 753 2,682 2,630 Emerging Businesses 331 102 2,170 16,104 2,501 16,206 Corporate Office and Other 55 45 55 45 Consolidated $ 9,795 $ 13,845 $ 33,123 $ 50,833 $ 42,918 $ 64,678 For 2005, total capital expenditures increased $21.8 million, or 50.7% from 2004. The 2005 sustaining capital expenditures are consistent with our expectations for the on going maintenance activities on our sites. The increase in revenue generating capital expenditures is primarily driven by: (1) the installation of distributed antenna systems by Crown Castle Solutions (totaling approximately $8.0 million), including systems at Disneyland and Hilton Head Island; and (2) expenditures by Modeo related to the planned build of a dedicated digital network for broadcasting live television to mobile devices (totaling approximately $8.1 million). Our decisions regarding the construction of new towers and distributed antenna systems are discretionary and depend upon expectations of achieving acceptable rates of return given current market conditions. Such decisions are influenced by the availability of capital and expected returns on alternative investments. Other Investments. In July 2005, we invested an additional $55.0 million in FiberTower. FiberTower raised a total of $150.0 million, inclusive of our investment of $55.0 million, through a private equity offering. In August 2005, we acquired 467 towers from an affiliate of Trintel for approximately $145.0 million in cash. We believe the acquisition of the towers from Trintel is consistent with our mission, which is to deliver the highest level of service to our customers at all times striving to be their critical partner as we assist them in growing efficient, ubiquitous wireless networks. The expansion into major markets, such as Detroit and Dallas, resulting from this acquisition, further positions us to accomplish this mission. We also believe acquiring these towers from Trintel is consistent with our strategy of increasing recurring revenue and cash flow. 47 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Financing Activities For 2003, 2004 and 2005, our net cash provided by (used for) financing activities was $71.1 million, $(1.7) billion and $(445.2) million, respectively. These amounts for 2004 and 2005 are largely due to financing transactions we have completed in an effort to lower our future cash interest payments and simplify our capital structure as discussed herein, as we continue to invest in opportunities we believe will drive long term shareholder value. The following is a summary of the significant financing transactions we completed in 2005: Issuance of Debt. On June 8, 2005, we issued Tower Revenue Notes in the amount of $1.9 billion in a private transaction. The notes are rated investment grade and are secured by our assignable U.S. personal property, license agreements, revenues and or distributions related to our towers as of June 2005 located in the U.S. The notes are fixed rate obligations of ours, with interest rates ranging from 4.643% to 5.612%. The weighted average interest rate on the debt is 4.890%. The proceeds from the sale of the notes net of certain fees and expenses of issuance of the $1.9 billion Tower Revenue Notes were used to (1) purchase the tendered 10 3/4% Senior Notes, 9 3/8% Senior Notes, 7.5% Senior Notes and 7.5% Series B Senior Notes; (2) redeem the 9% Senior Notes, 9 1/2% Senior Notes, 10 3/8% Discount Notes, 11 1/4% Discount Notes; and (3) repay our previously outstanding Crown Atlantic Credit Facility. In addition, on June 8, 2005, proceeds of $48.9 million were used to fund certain reserve accounts, in accordance with the indenture governing the notes, for the payment of ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums related to the towers, other assessments by governmental authorities and potential environmental remediation costs, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from customers. The balance was made available for general corporate purposes. A summary of the use of proceeds from the issuance of such notes is as follows: (In thousands of dollars) Tendered Notes, including accrued interest of $30.1 million (see Purchases of Debt below) $ 1,606,316 Redemption of Notes, including accrued interest of $1.2 million (see Purchases of Debt below) 56,172 Crown Atlantic Credit Facility repayment, swap repayments and termination payment (see Purchases of Debt below) 108,789 Fund reserve accounts 48,873 Underwriting fees and expenses 18,616 Third party deal expenses 5,168 General corporate purposes 56,066 $ 1,900,000 On August 1, 2005, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks on a $275.0 million revolving credit facility (2005 Credit Facility). We utilized $145.0 million of borrowings under the 2005 Credit Facility to fund the Trintel tower acquisition. On November 2, 2005, we borrowed an additional $55.0 million for general corporate purposes. On December 1, 2005, we amended the credit facility from $275.0 million to $325.0 million, borrowed an additional $95.0 million, which was used to partially fund the redemption of preferred stock and accrued dividends (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Preferred Stock Purchases and Dividends), and extended the maturity to November 28, 2006. Additional borrowings under the 2005 Credit Facility may be used for capital expenditures and acquisitions, subject to certain conditions. Interest Rate Swaps. On May 18, 2005, we entered into a five year forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $1.9 billion to fix our interest cash outflows, in contemplation of the $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of Tower Revenue Notes that were issued on June 8, 2005, at 4.295% plus the applicable credit spread. The terms of the interest rate swap call for us to receive interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR and to pay interest at a fixed annual rate of 4.295%. On May 27, 2005, the effective date of the interest rate swap, the interest rate swap was terminated resulting in a $5.7 million settlement payment by us. The settlement payment will be amortized into interest expense on a straight line basis through 2010, the anticipated repayment date on the $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of Tower Revenue Notes. The amortization of the settlement payment into interest expense increases the effective interest rate paid by us on the notes by approximately 0.06%. 48 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements On December 15, 2005, we entered into two five year forward starting interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of $175.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively, to fix our interest cash outflows, in contemplation of refinancing the credit facility in June 2006. The terms of the interest rate swaps call for us to receive interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR and to pay interest at fixed rates of 4.935% and 4.95% on the notional amounts of $175.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively. The interest rate swaps will effectively change the interest rate on the refinanced borrowings expected to occur in June 2006 from a floating rate based on LIBOR to a weighted average rate of 4.9395% plus the applicable margin. On January 27, 2006, we terminated these interest rate swaps and entered into two new interest rate swaps with similar terms to fix our interest cash outflows, in contemplation of refinancing the credit facility in June 2006. No settlement payment was required to terminate the interest rate swaps. On March 1, 2006, we entered into three five year forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of $1.9 billion to fix its interest cash outflows, in contemplation of the expected June 2010 refinancing of the $1.9 billion Tower Revenue Notes issued in June 2005. The terms of the interest rate swaps call for us to receive interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR and to pay interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 5.111% plus the applicable margin. The interest rate swaps will effectively change the interest rate on the refinanced borrowings expected to occur in June 2010 from a floating rate based on LIBOR to 5.111% plus the applicable margin. We have used, and will continue to use when we deem prudent, interest rate swap agreements to manage and reduce interest rate risk to us. Purchases of Debt. Our purchases of the debt securities in 2005, including purchases pursuant to the tender offers and redemptions, resulted in losses of $283.8 million for 2005. Such losses are included in interest and other income (expense) on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Such purchases were as follows: Principal Amountand Carrying Value Cash Paid Losses onPurchase Twelve MonthsEnded December 31, 2005 Twelve MonthsEnded December 31, 2005 (In thousands of dollars) 4% Convertible Senior Notes due 2010 $ 118,052 $ 217,127 $ 102,070 10 3/8% Senior Discount Notes due 2011 11,341 11,733 504 9% Senior Notes due 2011 26,133 26,917 1,214 11 1/4% Senior Discount Notes due 2011 10,700 11,302 676 9 1/2% Senior Notes due 2011 4,753 4,979 283 10 3/4% Senior Notes due 2011 418,304 445,166 35,037 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2011 405,523 448,018 47,872 7.5% Senior Notes due 2013 299,944 341,464 47,598 7.5% Series B Senior Notes due 2013 299,962 341,517 48,543 $ 1,594,712 $ 1,848,223 $ 283,797 See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding purchases of debt. Purchases of Common Stock. During 2004 and 2005, we purchased 3.4 million and 16.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, exclusive of shares of common stock purchased from the dividend paying agent following the issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock dividend. We utilized $47.1 million and $310.1 million in cash, respectively, to effect these purchases. We may choose to continue purchases of common stock in the future. Preferred Stock Purchases and Dividends. On November 30, 2005, we exercised our redemption right for the 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock. On December 16, 2005, we redeemed $200.0 million face value of our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock for $204.1 million in cash, including accrued interest of $4.1 million. The redemption 49 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements resulted in losses of $12.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005, consisting of the write off of deferred financing costs included in additional paid in capital ($9.4 million), and the excess of the total purchase price over the carrying value of the redeemed convertible preferred stock ($2.6 million). The redemption eliminated the potential future conversion of the 8 1/4% preferred stock into 7,442,000 shares of common stock. Prior to the redemption in December 2005, we had the option to pay the dividends on our 8 1/4% preferred stock in cash or shares of common stock (see Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities). We also have the option to pay dividends on our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock in cash or shares of common stock (valued at 95% of the current market value of the common stock, as defined) (see Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities). We are required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock on August 15, 2012 at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The shares of 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the holder, in whole or in part at any time, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $36.875 per share of common stock. Under certain circumstances, we generally have the right to convert the 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into 8.6 million shares of common stock at 120% of the conversion price or $44.25. Financing Restrictions. Our credit facilities require our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial covenants and place restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt and liens, undertake transactions with affiliates or related persons, dispose of towers, or make distributions of property, securities, or equity, or make distributions of cash if certain covenants are breached. See Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, note 8 for discussion of debt covenants. Restricted Cash. Pursuant to the indenture agreement governing the $1.9 billion Tower Revenue Notes, all rental cash receipts of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by the indenture trustee (Indenture Trustee) each month. The monies in excess of required reserve balances are subsequently released to us on the 15th calendar day following month end. On January 15, 2006, $34.3 million was released to us by the Indenture Trustee. Contractual Cash Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2005: Years Ending December 31, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Totals (In thousands of dollars) Long term debt (a) $ 295,000 $ $ $ $ 1,963,964 $ 11,722 $ 2,270,686 Interest payments on long term debt (a) (b) 114,763 95,834 95,834 95,834 48,855 730 451,850 Capital lease obligations 836 569 361 92 1,858 Operating lease obligations (c) 112,928 114,344 115,121 115,678 116,762 1,434,432 2,009,265 Redeemable preferred stock (d) 318,050 318,050 Asset retirement obligations (e) 16,742 16,742 $ 523,527 $ 210,747 $ 211,316 $ 211,604 $ 2,129,581 $ 1,781,676 $ 5,068,451 (a) Tower Revenue Notes are presented assuming payment in full is expected to occur on the Anticipated Repayment Date in June of 2010. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. (b) Interest payments on floating rate debt are estimated based on rates in effect during the first quarter of 2006. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. (c) Amounts relate primarily to ground lease obligations for our tower sites, and are based on the assumption that payments will be made through the end of the period for which we hold renewal rights. (d) Amounts are exclusive of preferred stock dividends, which may be paid in cash or shares of common stock. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. (e) Amounts represent the liability at December 31, 2005 for asset retirement obligations related to certain tower site land leases. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The remaining terms to expiration (including renewal terms at our option) of the ground leases, subleases, or licenses for the U.S. sites which we do not own and on which our towers are located, are as follows: Remaining Term, In Years, as of December 31, 2005 Number of Sites Percent of TotalU.S. Sites 15+ years 6,134 56 % 14 15 years 930 8 % 12 13 years 567 5 % 10 11 years 476 4 % 8 9 years 400 4 % 6 7 years 228 2 % 4 5 years 206 2 % 2 3 years 118 1 % 0 1 year 75 1 % 9,134 83 % In 2004, we began a program through which we seek to (1) renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases, subleases and licenses relating to the sites on which our U.S. towers are located or (2) purchase the land on which such towers reside. For the year ended December 31, 2005, (1) term extensions of ground leases, subleases or licenses relating to 828 sites have been renegotiated or are pending final closing, with a weighted average extension of approximately 30 years and (2) 147 sites on which our towers reside have been purchased or are pending final closing. See Risk Factors We Generally Lease or Sublease the Land Under Our Towers and May Not Be Able to Extend These Leases. We have issued letters of credit to various landlords, insurers and other parties in connection with certain contingent retirement obligations under various tower site land leases and certain other contractual obligations. The letters of credit were issued through one of CCUSAs lenders in amounts aggregating $7.8 million and expire on various dates through May of 2007. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity The factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with their current and future debt covenants are: (1) financial performance, (2) levels of indebtedness, and (3) debt service requirements. Given the current level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries, the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would result from a deterioration of a subsidiarys financial performance. Should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance (or for any other reason), we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation continues. Any such early principal payments would have to be made from our existing cash balances or cash from operations. As a holding company, Crown Castle International Corp. (CCIC) will require distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or will be forced to use our remaining cash balances, to fund the holding companys debt obligations (including the 4% Convertible Senior Notes and the guarantee of the 2000 Credit Facility entered into in July 2005, after consideration of the July redemptions), including interest payments on the notes. The terms of the current indebtedness of our subsidiaries allow the ability to distribute cash to CCIC unless they experience a deterioration of financial performance. In addition, there can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash from their operations to make any permitted distributions pursuant to our current or future indebtedness. As a result, we could be required to apply a portion of our remaining cash to fund interest payments on the notes. If we do not retain sufficient funds or raise additional funds from any future financing, we may not be able to make our interest payments on the notes. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of, or to pay interest on, our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations, will depend on our future performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. See Risk Factors. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Accounting and Reporting Matters Related Party Transactions For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, we had revenues from Verizon Wireless of $128.1 million (as restated) and $131.7 million (as restated), respectively. Verizon Wireless was a majority owned subsidiary of Verizon, our former partner in Crown Atlantic and Crown Castle GT. On November 4, 2004, we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Verizon to acquire Verizons remaining 37.245% equity interest in Crown Atlantic. See also note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies The following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Revenue Recognition. Site rental revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed, non cancelable term of the relevant lease or agreement with terms generally ranging from five to 10 years. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, these revenues are recognized on a monthly basis, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. If the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight line basis over the fixed, non cancelable term of the agreement. When calculating our straight line rental revenues, we consider all fixed elements of tenant leases escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions also include a variable element. As a result of this accounting method, a portion of the revenue recognized in a given period represents cash collected in other periods. For 2003, 2004 and 2005, the non cash portion of our site rental revenues amounted to approximately $21.3 million (as restated), $19.2 million (as restated) and $16.1 million, respectively (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Non Cash Site Rental Margin). Network services revenues generally represent installation of antennas, lines and construction services for co locations on our towers, and are generally recognized under a method which approximates the completed contract method. Under the completed contract method, revenues and costs for a particular project are recognized in total at the completion date. When using the completed contract method of accounting for network services revenues, we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period. For antenna installations, we consider the project complete when the customer can begin transmitting its signal through the antenna. We must also be able to estimate losses on uncompleted contracts; as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are known. The completed contract method is used for projects that require relatively short periods of time to complete (generally less than one year), such as our network services agreements and contracts. We do not believe that our use of the completed contract method for network services projects produces financial position and operating results that differ substantially from the percentage of completion method. Some of our arrangements with our customers call for the performance of multiple revenue generating activities. Generally, these arrangements include both site rental and network services. In such cases, we determine whether the multiple deliverables are to be accounted for separately or on a combined basis. In order to be accounted for separately, the undelivered items must (1) have stand alone value to the customer, (2) have reliably determinable fair value on a separate basis, and (3) have delivery which is probable and under our control. Allocation of recognized revenue in such arrangements is based on the relative fair value of the separately delivered items. We have generally determined that it is appropriate to account for antenna installation activities separately from the customers subsequent site rentals. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable. As part of our normal accounting procedures, we must evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected. This is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our customers ability and willingness to pay these accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance that we believe will be collected. In estimating the appropriate balance for this allowance, we consider (1) specific reserves for 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements accounts we believe may prove to be uncollectible and (2) additional reserves, based on historical collections, for the remainder of our accounts. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to costs of operations, and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts should prove to be inaccurate at some future date, the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Valuation of Long Lived Assets. We review the carrying values of property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from the asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred will generally involve (1) a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results or (3) a change in strategy affecting the utility of the asset. Our measurement of the fair value of an impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. Depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of assets. The substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our towers which are depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease (including optional renewal periods). See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. This annual impairment test involves (1) a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values, and (2) a step to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit. The most important estimates for such calculations are the expected additions of new tenants on our towers, the terminal multiple for our projected cash flows and our weighted average cost of capital. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we performed our annual update of the impairment test for goodwill. The results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired at any of our reporting units. Future declines in our site leasing business could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future. If impairment were to occur in the future, the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the write off of some portion, to substantially all, of our goodwill. Deferred Income Taxes. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods. In order to compute these deferred tax balances, we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities (referred to as temporary differences). These temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. The change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). If our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate, the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods. Such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. See note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123(R)) (revised 2004), Share Based Payment. SFAS 123(R) requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS 123(R) clarifies and expands SFAS 123s guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability, and attributing compensation cost to reporting periods. SFAS 123(R) also requires that forfeitures of awards be estimated when granted, while SFAS 123 allowed forfeitures to be accounted for as they occur. SFAS 123(R) also 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements requires additional disclosures about stock based compensation awards. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006. On January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation using the prospective method of transition under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. SFAS 123(R) requires the use of a modified version of prospective application under which compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for (1) awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after that date and (2) the unvested portion of awards outstanding on that date based on their grant date fair values. In October and November 2005 and February 2006, the FASB released Financial Staff Position FSP 123(R) 2, Practical Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement No 123(R), FSP 123 (R) 3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards and FSP 123 (R) 4, Classification of Options and Similar Instruments Issued as Employee Compensation that Allow for Cash Settlement upon the Occurrence of a Contingent Event. The FSPs clarify certain accounting provisions set forth in SFAS 123(R). We expect that the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and the FSPs will increase our non cash compensation charges by approximately $0.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2006. In March 2005, the SEC staff issued guidance on SFAS 123(R) (FAS 123(R)), Share Based Payment. Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of SFAS 123(R) while enhancing the information that investors receive. SAB 107 creates a framework that is premised on two overarching themes: (a) considerable judgment will be required by preparers to successfully implement SFAS 123(R), specifically when valuing employee stock options; and (b) reasonable individuals, acting in good faith, may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options. Key topics covered by SAB 107 include: (a) valuation models SAB 107 reinforces the flexibility allowed by SFAS 123(R) to choose an option pricing model that meets the standards fair value measurement objective; (b) expected volatility SAB 107 provides guidance on when it would be appropriate to rely exclusively on either historical or implied volatility in estimating expected volatility; and (c) expected term the new guidance includes examples and some simplified approaches to determining the expected term under certain circumstances. We will apply the principles of SAB 107 in conjunction with our adoption of SFAS 123(R). However, we reclassified non cash compensation charges to the same line items within the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as cash compensation paid to employees, in accordance with the provisions of SAB 107. The amount of each line item that is attributable to non cash compensation charges is provided parenthetically on the face of the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). In March 2005, the FASB issued FIN 47, which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 (SFAS 143), Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143 requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. The types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by FIN 47 are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, but the timing and (or) method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective no later than fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. We adopted FIN 47 on December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 resulted in the recognition of liabilities amounting to $14.0 million for contingent retirement obligations under certain tower site land leases, asset retirement costs amounting to $4.9 million, and the recognition of a charge for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle amounting to $9.0 million. At December 31, 2004 and 2005, liabilities for contingent retirement obligations amounted to $1.7 million and $16.7 million, respectively. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the related impact on our consolidated financial statements. Non GAAP Financial Measures Our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted, or Adjusted EBITDA. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Operating Segments. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements other companies, including companies in the tower sector, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss, net income or loss, cash flows provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because: it is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations, including the efficiency of our employees and the profitability associated with their performance, the realization of contract revenue under our long term contracts, our ability to obtain and maintain our customers and our ability to operate our leasing and licensing business effectively; it is the primary measure of profit and loss used by management for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operating segments; it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations; although specific definitions may vary, it is widely used in the wireless tower industry to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; and we believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization, and accretion) from our operating results. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA: with respect to compliance with our debt covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios including, or similar to, Adjusted EBITDA; as the primary measure of profit and loss for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operating segments; as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our operating results; in presentations to our Board of Directors to enable it to have the same measurement of operating performance used by management; for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual operating budget; and as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets. There are material limitations to using a measure such as Adjusted EBITDA, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income or loss. Management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income (loss). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a result of our international operating, investing and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks, which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In attempting to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities, we seek to manage exposure to changes in interest rates (see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rate Swaps) and foreign currency exchange rates where economically prudent to do so. Certain of the financial instruments we have used to obtain capital are subject to market risks for fluctuations in market interest rates. The majority of our financial instruments, however, are long term fixed interest rate instruments. As of December 31, 2005, we had $295.0 million of floating rate indebtedness, or approximately 13.0% of total long term debt. As a result, a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point over the next twelve months would impact our interest expense by approximately $3.0 million. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The majority of our foreign currency transactions are denominated in the Australian dollar, which is the functional currency of CCAL. As a result of CCALs transactions being denominated and settled in such functional currencies, the risks associated with currency fluctuations are primarily associated with foreign currency translation adjustments. We do not currently hedge against foreign currency translation risks and do not currently believe that foreign currency exchange risk is significant to our operations. The average monthly exchange rate used to translate the 2004 financial statements for CCAL fluctuated between a low of 0.6937 and a high of 0.7770. The average monthly exchange rate used to translate the 2005 financial statements for CCAL fluctuated between a low of 0.7353 and a high of 0.7848.
