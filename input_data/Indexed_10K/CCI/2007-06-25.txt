Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview). We intend to continue to use targeted sales and marketing techniques to lease space and increase the investment return on our towers. Grow Margins and Operating Cash Flow. We are seeking to maximize operating cash flow by taking advantage of the potential for operating margin expansion afforded by the relatively fixed nature of the operating costs associated with our site rental business. The majority of the operating costs of our site rental business consist of ground lease expense, property taxes, repairs and maintenance, utilities and salaries, which tend to escalate at approximately the rate of inflation. Consequently, if increased utilization of tower capacity is achieved at low incremental cost, our site rental business should experience operating margin expansion and result in growth in operating cash flow. Allocate Capital Efficiently. We are focused on the efficient utilization of capital. We may seek to enhance or expand our existing portfolio of towers through (1) the selective acquisition or build of strategically located towers that satisfy certain investment criteria and are complementary to our tower portfolio, (2) the acquisition of real property interests in the land on which our towers are located or (3) the enhancement of our existing towers. With respect to tower and site acquisitions, such transactions may include acquisitions of towers from major wireless carriers or other tower companies through direct acquisitions, tower exchanges, joint ventures, mergers or other means, as evidenced by the Global Signal Merger. With respect to tower builds and structural enhancements, we may selectively build new towers and structurally enhance our existing towers for customers as they expand and fill in their service areas and deploy new technologies requiring additional antenna space. Our decisions to invest additional capital in structural enhancements and selective acquisitions or build activities are generally based upon whether such investments exhibit sufficient co location revenue potential to achieve acceptable risk adjusted returns. From time to time, we may sell or exchange certain of our towers or other assets as opportunities arise. In addition, we have used, and may continue to use, some of our capital to acquire our debt and equity securities when such acquisitions appear economically viable and capital efficient. 4 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Extend Revenue by Leveraging our Existing Expertise. We are seeking to extend the products and services we offer beyond the leasing of space on our towers to other potentially shareable activities, such as distributed antenna systems (DAS), antenna and base station maintenance, shared antennas, shared radio spectrum, shared point to point radio backhaul and network maintenance and monitoring. We believe these opportunities would leverage our experience in engineering, deploying, owning, managing and operating our extensive portfolio of towers and our strong customer relationships. We believe many of these opportunities are consistent with our four point value proposition to assist our customers in solving their coverage and capacity gaps, as discussed further in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview. Further, we are pursuing other strategic opportunities, or adjacent businesses, which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to achieve acceptable risk adjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our existing assets and expertise, as evidenced by our investments in Modeo and FiberTower. See Item 1. Business The Company Emerging Businesses. 2006 Highlights and Recent Developments During 2006, we engaged in a number of significant activities consistent with our strategy, including entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Global Signal, the purchase of shares of our common stock (common stock), the refinancing and issuance of indebtedness and the acquisition of Mountain Union Telecom, LLC (Mountain Union). The Global Signal Merger is discussed below under Item 1. Business Global Signal Merger. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Overview for a summary description of the highlights of such other activities occurring in 2006 and the beginning of 2007. Global Signal Merger On October 5, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement (Merger Agreement) which contemplated the merger of Global Signal into a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. Global Signal operated 10,749 towers, primarily concentrated in the southwestern, midwestern, Pacific coast and northeastern regions of the U.S. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on January 12, 2007, Global Signal was merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.0 billion, exclusive of debt of approximately $1.8 billion that remained outstanding as obligations of the Global Signal entities acquired. As a result of the completion of Global Signal Merger, we issued approximately 98.1 million shares of common stock and paid the maximum $550.0 million in cash (Cash Consideration) to the stockholders of Global Signal and reserved for issuance approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock issuable pursuant to Global Signal warrants. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Global Signal common stockholders were entitled to convert each share of Global Signal common stock into 1.61 shares of our common stock or, alternatively, could elect to receive cash in the amount of $55.95 per Global Signal share. Following the Global Signal Merger, the former Global Signal stockholders owned approximately 32.7% of our outstanding shares. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Current Year Highlights and Recent Developments, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 1. Business The Company CCUSA. Upon closing of the Global Signal Merger, Global Signals subsidiaries had debt outstanding of approximately $1.8 billion (all of which remained outstanding as obligations of the Global Signal entities we acquired) having a structure similar to the $1.9 billion in notes issued through certain of our subsidiaries in June 2005 (2005 Tower Revenue Notes) and the $1.55 billion in notes issued through certain of our subsidiaries in November 2006 (2006 Tower Revenue Notes). As a result, we have significantly increased our interest expense. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities. Global Signal revenues, cost of operations and gross margins for 2006 were approximately $500 million (unaudited), $225 million (unaudited) and $275 million (unaudited), respectively. We entered into the Global Signal Merger primarily because of the growth opportunities we anticipate the Global Signal tower portfolio will provide, including through the leveraging of our management team and customer service across an enhanced national footprint. We believe the anticipated opportunities for growth will be driven by the carrier focus on improving network quality, subscriber growth, increasing subscriber usage, wireline replacement and next generation network 5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements builds. See "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Overview." Secondarily, we believe there will be synergistic opportunities provided by the Global Signal Merger. In 2007, as a result of the Global Signal Merger, we do expect a substantial increase in our general and administrative expenses from 2006, but we also anticipate a decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. We also expect to incur a substantial amount of costs to integrate Global Signal into our internal control structure and operations. Stockholders Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a stockholders agreement (Stockholders Agreement) with (1) certain investment funds affiliated with Fortress Investment Group LLC (collectively, Fortress), (2) Greenhill Capital Partners, L.P. and certain of its related partnerships (collectively, Greenhill), and (3) Abrams Capital Partners II, L.P. and certain of its related partnerships (collectively, Abrams Capital, and together with Fortress and Greenhill, the Global Signal Significant Stockholders). Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, we have filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC registering certain shares of our common stock received by the Global Signal Significant Stockholders in the merger (Merger Shares). In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Global Signal Significant Stockholders (and certain of their affiliates) (1) have a limited number of demands for us to register their Merger Shares and (2) will be able to have their respective Merger Shares registered whenever we propose to register our equity securities. In lieu of Global Signal Significant Stockholders right to require us to conduct a marketed secondary offering of certain of their Merger Shares within 90 days after the merger, on January 19, 2007, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the Global Signal Significant Stockholders, pursuant to which we purchased an aggregate of 17.7 million shares of our common stock from the Global Signal Significant Stockholders (January 2007 Stock Purchase). See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Current Year Highlights and Recent Developments. As required by the Stockholders Agreement, we have appointed a representative of each of the Global Signal Significant Stockholders to our Board of Directors. Wesley R. Edens, Robert H. Niehaus and David C. Abrams were appointed to the Board of Directors as representatives of Fortress, Greenhill and Abrams Capital, respectively. Each Global Signal Stockholder has a one time right to re nominate its designated director (or another individual reasonably acceptable to us) if such Global Signal Stockholder owns more than 3.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of such re nomination. The Company We operate our business primarily in the U.S. (including Puerto Rico) and Australia, with limited additional operations in Canada and the U. K. We conduct our operations principally through subsidiaries of Crown Castle Operating Company (CCOC), including (1) certain subsidiaries which operate our tower portfolios in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada (referred to as CCUSA) and (2) a joint venture in which we have a 77.6% interest that operates our Australia tower portfolio (referred to as CCAL). For more information about our operating segments, as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and the section entitled Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below. CCUSA Overview The primary business of CCUSA is the leasing of antenna space on multiple tenant towers to a variety of customers under long term leases. Supporting our competitive position in the site rental business, we offer our customers certain network services relating to our towers, including antenna installations and other services. At December 31, 2006, Post Merger, CCUSA owned, leased or managed 22,274 towers, including rooftop installations. Although we own, lease or manage 252 towers located in Puerto Rico and Canada that are included in CCUSA, our towers are primarily located throughout the U.S. The U.S. towers are located predominantly in the northeast, southeast, midwest, southwest and Pacific coast regions of the U.S. Most of our towers were acquired 6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements through transactions consummated within the past eight years, including through transactions with Global Signal, Bell Atlantic Mobile and GTE Wireless (both now part of Verizon Wireless), BellSouth Mobility and BellSouth DCS (both now part of AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless)) and Powertel (now a part of T Mobile). Through the Global Signal Merger, which closed on January 12, 2007, we acquired 10,749 towers which are located primarily in the U.S. Of the 10,749 towers Global Signal operated and which we now operate, 6,553 towers (Sprint Towers) are to be leased or operated for a period of 32 years (through May 2037) under master leases and subleases (Sprint Master Leases) with Sprint Corporation (a predecessor of Sprint Nextel) and certain subsidiaries of Sprint Corporation entered into in May 2005. Global Signal prepaid the rent owed under the Sprint Master Leases in May 2005. During the period commencing one year prior to the expiration of the Sprint Master Leases and ending 120 days prior to expiration, Post Merger we have the option to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Sprint Towers then leased for approximately $2.3 billion. Post Merger we are entitled to all revenue from the Sprint Towers during the term of the Sprint Master Leases, including amounts payable under existing leases with third parties. In addition, under the Sprint Master Leases, certain Sprint Corporation subsidiaries have agreed to sublease space on substantially all of the Sprint Towers for an initial period of 10 years. At the closing of the Global Signal Merger, the Sprint Master Leases remained effective as an asset and commitment of the Global Signal entities we acquired. Prior to the Global Signal Merger, our communication towers were primarily acquired in transactions beginning in 1998 through 2000, including the following transactions: Acquisition Transaction Closing Dates No. of CurrentCommunicationTowers Primary Tower Locations Bell Atlantic Mobile March 1999 2,020 Eastern, Southwestern U.S. GTE Wireless January September 2000 (a) 2,881 Eastern, Midwestern, Southwestern and Pacific Coast areas of the U.S. Bell South Mobility and Bell South DCS June 1999 December 2000(b) 3,046 Southeastern and Midwestern U.S. Powertel June 1999 675 Southeastern U.S. Trintel Communications Inc. August 2005 467 Midwestern U.S. Mountain Union Telecom, LLC July 2006 474 (c) Puerto Rico and Southern U.S. (a) The towers from GTE wireless were acquired in tranches from January 2000 through September 2000. (b) The towers from Bell South Mobility and Bell South DCS were acquired in tranches from June 1999 through December 2000. (c) The tower count is exclusive of 77 towers in various stages of development as of July 2006. We plan to continue to structurally enhance our existing towers and selectively build or acquire strategically located towers which meet certain economic criteria on a limited basis. To reduce risk and speculation, in connection with building towers, we generally look for towers with multiple tenant demand and obtain lease commitments from customers prior to building such towers. Further, the towers are constructed to accommodate multiple tenants in order to obviate the need for later structural enhancement, saving capital and time for our customers. Site Rental CCUSA rents antenna space on its towers to a variety of carriers operating cellular, PCS, ESMR, 3G, wireless data services, paging and other networks. The number of antennae that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the towers location, height and structural capacity. We generally receive monthly rental payments from customers, payable under site leases. The new leases at CCUSA recently entered into by us typically have original terms of seven to 10 years (with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each) and provide for annual price increases based upon a consumer price index, a fixed percentage or a combination thereof. The lease agreements with our customers relating to tower network 7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements acquisitions generally have an original term of 10 years, with multiple renewal options, each typically ranging from five to 10 years. We have existing master lease agreements with most major wireless carriers, including Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile, which provide certain terms (including economic terms) that govern leases on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements. The average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies among the different regions in the U.S. and the type of service being provided by the tenant, with broadband tenants (such as PCS) paying more than narrowband tenants (such as paging), primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation. In addition, we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments which authorize carriers to add additional antennas or other equipment to towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to pre existing lease agreements. Network Services We also provide network services, on a limited basis, primarily relating to our towers for our customers. Our service offering consists of antenna installations and subsequent augmentation, network design and site selection, site acquisition, site development and other services. Customers In both the CCUSA site rental and network services businesses, we work with a number of customers in a variety of businesses including cellular, PCS, ESMR, 3G, wireless data services and paging. We work extensively with large national wireless carriers such as Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile. For the year ended December 31, 2006, these four carriers, accounted for approximately 72.7% of CCUSAs revenues and 67.2% of our consolidated revenues, with Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile accounting for 16.0%, 25.4%, 22.0%, and 9.3%, respectively, of CCUSAs revenues and 14.8%, 23.5%, 20.3%, and 8.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, on a pro forma basis as if the Global Signal Merger was completed January 1, 2006, approximately 68.3% of our total combined revenues was derived from Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile, with such customers representing 24.2%, 20.4%, 15.3%, and 8.4% of our combined consolidated revenues, respectively. No other single customer of CCUSA accounted for more than 10.0% of our 2006 consolidated revenues. See Item 1A. Risk Factors A Substantial Portion of Our Revenues is Derived From a Small Number of Customers. Sales and Marketing The CCUSA sales organization markets our towers within the wireless telecommunications industry. We seek to become the preferred independent tower provider for our customers. We use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network build outs, modifications, site additions and network services. Information about carriers existing location of antenna space, leases, marketing strategies, capital spend plans, deployment status, and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field is analyzed to match specific towers in our portfolios with potential new site demand. In addition, we have developed patented property management tools and software which allow us to estimate site leasing demand with greater speed and accuracy. Through these and other tools we have developed, we seek to determine potential demand for our towers, allowing for proactive discussions with our carrier customers regarding these towers and the timing of their demand. A team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers. These directors work to develop new tower leasing opportunities, network services contracts and site management opportunities, as well as to ensure that customers tower needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our towers. Sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with carriers that are expanding their networks, entering new markets, bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or add on business. We target numerous types of customers, including cellular, PCS, ESMR, 3G, wireless data, paging and government agencies. Our objective is to lease space on existing towers and pre sell capacity on our new towers prior to construction. 8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition to our full time sales and marketing staff, a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers. Competition CCUSA competes with other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services; wireless carriers which build, own and operate their own tower networks; broadcasters with respect to their broadcast towers; building owners that lease antenna space on rooftop sites; and other potential competitors, such as utilities and outdoor advertisers, some of which actively participate in the site rental industry. Wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have. We believe that tower location, deployment speed, capacity, quality of service and price has been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower. Some of the larger independent tower companies with which CCUSA competes in the U.S. include American Tower Corporation, SBA Communications Corporation and Global Tower Partners. Significant additional site rental competition comes from the leasing of rooftops, utility structures and other alternative sites for antennas. Competitors in the network services business include site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right of way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors, and our customers internal staffs. We believe that carriers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience, track record, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We Operate Our Business In a Competitive Industry and Some of Our Competitors Have Significantly More Resources or Less Debt Than We Do. CCAL Our primary business in Australia is the leasing of antenna space on towers to our customers. CCAL, a joint venture which is owned 77.6% by us and 22.4% by Permanent Nominees (Aust) Ltd, acting on behalf of a group of professional and institutional investors led by Jump Capital Limited, is our principal Australian operating subsidiary. CCAL is the largest independent tower operator in Australia. As of December 31, 2006, CCAL had 1,387 towers, with a strategic presence in each of Australias major metropolitan areas, including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. For the year ended December 31, 2006, CCAL comprised 7.6% of our consolidated revenues. CCALs principal customers are Optus, Vodafone Australia, Hutchison and Telstra. For the year ended December 31, 2006, these four carriers accounted for approximately 94.4% of CCALs revenues, with Vodafone Australia and Optus accounting for 34.5% and 34.1%, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors A Substantial Portion of Our Revenues is Derived From a Small Number of Customers. The majority of CCAL towers were acquired from Optus and Vodafone Australia in 2000 and 2001, respectively. In connection with these transactions, Optus agreed to lease space on the former Optus towers for an initial term of 15 years, and Vodafone Australia agreed to lease space on the former Vodafone Australia towers for an initial rent free term of 10 years. In Australia, CCAL competes with wireless carriers, which own and operate their own tower networks; service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services; and other site owners, such as broadcasters and building owners. The two other significant tower owners in Australia are Broadcast Australia and Telstra. We believe that tower location, capacity, quality of service, deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a site. Several 3G networks continue to be developed in Australia. Two metropolitan networks are being built by joint ventures between Hutchison and Telstra and between Optus and Vodafone Australia, respectively. In addition, 9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Telstra has constructed the first phase of a new national 3G network, which is currently not shared with Hutchison, to replace one of its existing networks. The Telstra network was launched commercially in October 2006. Each of the 3G networks has already utilized a number of our towers in connection with its deployment, and we expect more of our towers will be utilized by each of the networks in 2007. In addition, Optus recently announced plans to provide nationwide 3G coverage with deployment commencing in 2007. Unwired Australia and Personal Broadband Australia also continued their deployment of broadband wireless networks (providing high speed internet services to consumers) in 2006, which are currently operating in key metropolitan markets. Emerging Businesses We have pursued and are currently pursuing other strategic opportunities, or adjacent businesses, which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to achieve acceptable risk adjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our core tower rental business. Such emerging adjacent businesses currently consist of Modeo. Modeo was formed in 2004 to explore a potential offering of live digital television and audio broadcast and podcasting to mobile devices, such as wireless phones. Modeo plans to offer this service as a wholesale network provider, utilizing the spectrum under our 1670 1675 MHz U.S. nationwide spectrum license (having an initial term of 10 years), which we acquired in 2003 through a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction. Modeo broadcasts its service using the Digital Video Broadcast to Handheld (DVB H) standard, the open standard for the broadcast of digital television to mobile devices. Modeo has had no revenues since inception. During 2006, Modeo completed the development of a commercial grade mobile television DVB H network in New York City. In December 2006, Modeo launched a live, commercial quality mobile television beta service in New York City that includes live video content from leading network programmers as well as streaming audio content. Modeo plans to stage its New York beta activities in phases throughout the first and second quarters of 2007, which will include establishing a formal beta test group. After we have received and evaluated the feedback from these beta activities, we will review and evaluate our options for expanding the Modeo network beyond New York City. We continue to evaluate the potential options for funding the build out of the Modeo network beyond New York City, which include: non recourse debt secured by our 1670 1675 MHz spectrum license, equity investors in Modeo, joint venture proposals, proposals to sell a controlling interest in Modeo along with a combination of the above. Many other companies, some with significantly greater resources than us, offer or plan to offer video and audio content to wireless handsets and other mobile devices. Although Modeos planned services are not yet commercially available, Modeo competes with these other offerings in bringing its service to commercial availability. If and when Modeos planned service becomes commercially available, Modeo will compete with these offerings to capture potential subscribers and market share. In particular, Qualcomm has announced that it is currently developing a multicast digital video service, marketed under the brand name MediaFLO. Verizon Wireless and AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless) have announced that they plan to offer their customers mobile video services over the MediaFLO network. In addition, Modeo may face competition from other companies offering podcasting and alternate methods of distributing video and audio to handheld devices. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Modeos Business Has Certain Risk Factors Different from our Core Tower Business, Including an Unproven Business Model. Employees At February 20, 2007, we employed approximately 1,160 people worldwide, inclusive of approximately 210 people previously employed by Global Signal who are providing services only during the integration of the Global Signal business. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages, and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory. Regulatory Matters To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations. The summary below is based on regulations currently in effect, and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Laws and Regulations, Which May Change at Any Time and With Which We May Fail to Comply, Regulate Our Business. 10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements United States Federal Regulations Both the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulate towers used for wireless communications transmitters and receivers. Such regulations control the siting and marking of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require the registration of tower facilities and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic. Wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used. In addition, the FCC and the FAA have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location, including proximity to airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation, which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements. The FCC requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with FAA rules and are registered with the FCC, if required by its regulations. Where tower lighting is required by FAA regulation, tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any tower lighting outage. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties. Local Regulations The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers. The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services. Additionally, the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radiofrequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Local regulations include city and other local ordinances (including subdivision and zoning ordinances), approvals for construction, modification and removal of towers, and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly, but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction. Local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height, visibility and other characteristics of the towers. Other Regulations We hold, through certain of our subsidiaries, certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the FCC, including licenses for common carrier microwave service, commercial and private mobile radio service, specialized mobile radio and paging service, which are subject to additional regulation by the FCC. Our FCC license relating to the 1670 to 1675 MHz spectrum band contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder, the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed. We are required to obtain the FCCs approval prior to assigning or transferring control of any of our FCC licenses. Australia Federal Regulation Carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the Australian Telecommunications Act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public. The definition of network units includes line links and base stations used for wireless telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure. Accordingly, CCAL as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license. Similarly, because CCAL does not own any transmitters or spectrum, it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the Australian Radiocommunications Act 1992. 11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers, and, if there is a dispute (including a pricing dispute), the matter may be referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for resolution. As a non carrier, CCAL is not subject to this regime, and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis. While the Australian Telecommunications Act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities, newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities. Accordingly, in connection with the construction of towers, CCAL is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site basis. Structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general maintenance power under the Australian Telecommunications Act 1997, although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if CCAL is unable to obtain carrier co operation to use that legislative power. For a limited number of towers, CCAL is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations. In Australia, a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the maintenance power under the Australian Telecommunications Act of 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease; however, CCALs customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this, and, even if a carrier did utilize this power, the carrier would be required to pay for CCALs financial loss, which would roughly equal the tower rental that would have otherwise been payable. Local Regulations In Australia there are various local, state and territory laws and regulations which relate to, among other things, town planning and zoning restrictions, standards and approvals for the design, construction or alteration of a structure or facility, and environmental regulations. As in the U.S., these laws vary greatly, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis. Environmental Matters To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Laws and Regulations, Which May Change at Any Time and With Which We May Fail to Comply, Regulate Our Business and Emissions From Antennas on Our Towers or Wireless Devices May Create Health Risks. The construction of new towers in the U.S. may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions. The FCC has promulgated regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction. Should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact, the FCC must prepare an environmental impact statement, subject to public comment. If a proposed tower may have a significant impact on the environment, the FCCs approval of the construction could be significantly delayed. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission, and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As an owner, lessee or operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on site or off site contamination relating to existing or historical operations, and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination. We are potentially subject to environmental and cleanup liabilities in the U.S. and Australia. As licensees and tower owners, we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions. As employers, we are subject to OSHA (and similar occupational health and safety legislation in Australia) and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements radio frequency exposure. The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us. Ite m 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investment in our securities. Global Signal Merger The Global Signal Merger may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The Global Signal Merger could cause disruptions in or otherwise negatively impact our business. Among other things: the business combination of Global Signal with us may disrupt our business relationships with our customers, who may delay or defer decisions about current and future agreements with us because of the merger; current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key managers and other employees; and the attention of management may be directed toward the integration of Global Signal with us and away from other business operations. Performance of Assets Acquired in the Global Signal Merger The assets acquired in the Global Signal Merger may not perform as expected, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In evaluating the anticipated benefits of a potential transaction with Global Signal, we performed due diligence on Global Signals tower portfolio and other assets to be acquired in the Global Signal Merger, which due diligence included, among other things, analyzing tower locations, visiting select towers, evaluating radio frequency information, and evaluating potential carrier customer demand. The results of this due diligence were used to support assumptions that were made by us in creating financial models to evaluate the potential future performance of Global Signals assets and the combined company. There can be no assurances that the towers and other assets of Global Signal will perform as expected by us based on our due diligence and provide us with the benefits that have been anticipated. A variety of factors could cause these assets not to provide such benefits, including, among other things: the inability to procure additional ground space at existing tower locations; local and state restrictions on the ability to modify such towers; and latent structural weaknesses associated with such towers and the related cost of repairing, reinforcing or upgrading them. If Global Signals assets fail to perform as expected or we fail to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of Global Signals assets for these or other reasons, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Integration of Global Signal The integration of Global Signal is expected to result in substantial expenses and may present significant challenges. We may face significant challenges in combining Global Signals operations in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key Global Signal personnel. This integration will be complex and time consuming. The failure to successfully integrate Global Signals business and to manage the challenges presented by the integration process successfully, including the retention of key Global Signal personnel, may result in us and our stockholders not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the Global Signal Merger. Achieving the benefits of the Global Signal Merger will depend in part on the integration of Global Signals operations, wireless communications tower portfolio and personnel in a timely and efficient manner and our ability to realize the anticipated synergies from this integration. This integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among others, the size of Global Signals wireless communications tower portfolio and because Global Signals and our internal systems and processes were developed without regard to such integration. Successful integration of Global Signal also requires coordination of personnel, which may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and differences in policies, procedures and operations between the companies and the different geographical locations of the companies and their assets. If the integration is not successful, we might not realize the expected benefits of the merger, which could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock after the merger. We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the Global Signal business into our policies, procedures, operations and systems. There are a large number of systems that must be integrated, including management information, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll and benefits, lease administration systems and regulatory compliance. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the Global Signal business may offset incremental transaction, merger related and restructuring costs over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all, and there are a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses. Our Business Depends on the Demand for Wireless Communications and Towers We may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand, including a slowdown attributable to wireless carrier consolidation or by the sharing of networks by wireless carriers. Demand for our towers depends on demand for antenna space from our customers, which, in turn, depends on the demand for wireless services. The willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure, or renew existing leases on our towers, will be affected by numerous factors, including: consumer demand for wireless services; availability and location of our towers and alternative towers; cost of capital, including interest rates; availability of capital to our customers; willingness to co locate equipment; local and state restrictions on the proliferation of towers; cost of building towers; technological changes affecting the number or type of communications sites needed to provide wireless communications services to a given geographic area; our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers service requirements; and tax policies. A slowdown in demand for a particular wireless segment may adversely affect the demand for our towers. Moreover, some wireless carriers operate with substantial indebtedness, and financial problems for our customers may result in accounts receivable going uncollected, the loss of a customer (and associated lease revenue) or a reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities. 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements A slowdown in the deployment of equipment for new wireless technologies, the consolidation of wireless carriers, the sharing of networks by wireless carriers or the increased use of alternative sites may also adversely affect the demand for our towers. In addition, advances in technology, such as the development of new antenna systems, new terrestrial deployment technologies and new satellite systems, may reduce the need for land based, or terrestrial, transmission networks or our towers. To some extent, almost all of the above factors have occurred in recent years with an adverse effect on our business, and such factors are likely to persist in the future. The occurrence of any of these factors may negatively impact our revenues, result in an impairment of our assets or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. A Substantial Portion of Our Revenues is Derived From a Small Number of Customers The loss or consolidation of, network sharing among, or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 67.2% of our consolidated revenue was derived from Sprint Nextel, Cingular, Verizon Wireless and T Mobile, which represented 14.8%, 23.5%, 20.3% and 8.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, on a pro forma basis as if the Global Signal Merger was completed January 1, 2006, approximately 68.3% of our total combined revenues were derived from Sprint Nextel, Cingular, Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile, which represented 24.2%, 20.4%, 15.3%, and 8.4% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy, consolidation, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may materially decrease our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business. We cannot guarantee that the leases (including management service agreements) with our major wireless carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers will renew such agreements. Wireless carriers frequently enter into agreements with their competitors allowing them to utilize one anothers towers to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home providers services. In addition, wireless carriers have also entered into agreements allowing two or more carriers to share a single wireless network or jointly develop a tower portfolio in certain locations. Such agreements may be viewed by wireless carriers as a superior alternative to leasing space for their own antennas on our towers. The proliferation of these roaming, network sharing and joint development agreements may have a material adverse effect on us. In the ordinary course of business, we also sometimes experience disputes with customers, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in their respective agreements. Although, historically, we have resolved these disputes on commercially reasonable terms, future disputes could lead to increased tensions and damaged relationships with customers that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable customer could be damaged, which could lead to decreased revenues (including as a result of losing a customer) or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Wireless Carrier Consolidation Consolidation among customers may result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of sites and have a negative effect on revenues and cash flows. Consolidation among customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, which may result in a reduction of cell sites and impact revenues from our towers. In recent years, certain of our larger carrier customers have merged, including Cingular Wireless (now known as AT&T) with AT&T Wireless in October 2004 and Sprint with Nextel in August 2005. Recent regulatory developments have made consolidation in the wireless industry easier and more likely. For example, in February 2002, the FCC enabled the ownership by a single entity of interests in both cellular carriers in overlapping metropolitan cellular service areas. In January 2003, the FCC eliminated the spectrum aggregation cap in a geographic area in favor of a case by case review of spectrum transactions. It is possible that at least some customers may take advantage of this relaxation of spectrum and ownership limitations and consolidate their businesses. Any industry consolidation could decrease the demand for our towers, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues. 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Substantial Level of Indebtedness Our substantial level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business. We may also be limited in our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As a consequence of our indebtedness, we (1) are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (2) may choose to institute self imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. For example, the limits imposed by our indebtedness restrict, under certain circumstances, our and certain of our respective subsidiaries ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness, issuing preferred stock, engaging in various types of transactions, such as mergers and sales of assets, and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments and investments. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. The following chart sets forth certain important credit information and is presented on a U.S. GAAP basis as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, and after giving effect to the $600.0 million term loan entered into in January 2007 (2007 Term Loan) and the January 2007 Stock Purchase. (In thousands of dollars) Total indebtedness $ 5,945,534 Redeemable preferred stock 312,871 Stockholders equity 3,533,332 Debt and redeemable preferred stock to equity ratio 1.77 As a result of our substantial debt, demands on our cash resources will increase, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of our common stock. As a result of our substantial indebtedness: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments, including capital expenditures; we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry; and we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt or pay our obligations under our preferred stock. In addition, we may need to refinance some or all of our indebtedness and preferred stock on or before maturity. If we are unable to refinance our debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements in the future. Fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, and after giving effect to the 2007 Term Loan, approximately 89.9% of our outstanding indebtedness consists of long term fixed interest rate notes. In addition, there is no guarantee future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. Crown Castle International Corp. (CCIC) is a holding company with no business operations of its own. We conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. As of January 31, 2007, approximately 1.1% of our consolidated indebtedness, was held at the holding company level (another 10.1% of our consolidated indebtedness is unconditionally guaranteed by the holding company). Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness held at the holding company level is distributions relating to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the cash flows and net earnings generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt, equity offerings, sale of FiberTower or Modeo or certain asset sales. If our subsidiaries are unable to dividend cash to us when we need it, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations, including interest and principal payments, under our debt instruments. 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Economic and Wireless Telecommunications Industry Slowdown an economic or wireless telecommunications industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our towers and network services) and the business of our customers. In past years, the U.S. economy, including the wireless telecommunications industry, has experienced significant general slowdowns which negatively affected the factors described in these risk factors, influencing demand for tower space and network services. Similar slowdowns in the U.S. or Australia in the future may reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively impact the debt and equity markets, thereby causing carriers to delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3G and other wireless broadband services. Further, unforeseen events, including the war on terrorism, the threat of additional terrorist attacks, the political and economic uncertainties resulting therefrom may impose additional risks upon and adversely affect the wireless telecommunications industry and us. We believe that the prior economic slowdowns in the U.S., particularly in the wireless telecommunications industry, have harmed, and similar slowdowns in the U.S. or Australia may further harm, the financial condition or operations of wireless carriers, some of which, including customers of ours, have filed for bankruptcy protection. We Operate Our Business In a Competitive Industry and Some of Our Competitors Have Significantly More Resources or Less Debt Than We Do As a result of this competition, we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable lease rates on our towers. We face competition for site rental customers from various sources, including: other large independent tower owners; wireless carriers that own and operate their own towers and lease antenna space to other carriers; alternative facilities such as rooftops, broadcast towers and utility poles; new alternative deployment methods; site development companies that acquire antenna space on existing towers for wireless carriers and manage new tower construction; and local independent tower operators. Wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios generally are substantially larger (particularly given the impact of recently completed wireless carrier mergers) and have greater financial resources than we have. Competition for tenants on towers may adversely affect lease rates and revenues. New Technologies May Make Our Tower Leasing Service Less Desirable to Potential Tenants and Result in Decreasing Revenues Such new technologies may significantly reduce demand for tower leases and negatively impact the growth in our revenues. The development and deployment of signal combining technologies, which permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and, thereby, multiple customers, may reduce the need for our antenna space. In addition, other technologies, such as DAS, wireless mesh networks, mobile satellite systems and the delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites, may, in the future, serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on our towers had such technologies not existed. Any reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from multiple frequency antennas, satellite, DAS, mesh networks or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. New Technologies May Not Perform as Projected New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected. There can be no assurances that 3G, wireless data services or other new wireless technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner previously or presently projected by the wireless or broadcast industries. In 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements addition, demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. As a result, growth opportunities and demand for site rental as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent previously or presently anticipated. We Generally Lease or Sublease the Land Under Our Towers and May Not Be Able to Extend These Leases If we fail to protect our rights against persons claiming superior rights to the land on which our towers are located, our business may be adversely affected. Our real property interests relating to the land on which our towers are located consist primarily of leasehold and sub leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights of way. A loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of towers. Further, we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms. Post Merger, approximately 9.8% of our towers are on land where our property interests in such land have a final expiration date of less than 10 years. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse affect on us. Our ability to protect our rights against persons claiming superior rights in towers or real property depends on our ability to: recover under title insurance policies, the policy limits of which are likely to be less than the purchase price or economic value of a particular tower; in the absence of title insurance coverage, recover under title warranties given by tower sellers, which often terminate after the expiration of a specific period (typically in three years or less), contain various exceptions and are dependent on the general creditworthiness of the sellers making the title warranties; obtain estoppels from landlords in connection with the acquisitions, or in some cases the subsequent financing, of towers, which protect the collateral of our lenders and may provide a basis for defending post closing claims arising from pre closing events; recover from landlords under title covenants contained in lease agreements, which are dependent on the general creditworthiness of the landlords making the title covenants; obtain non disturbance agreements from mortgagees and superior lienholders of the land under our towers; and renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases, subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our towers are located or purchase the land on which such towers reside. We May Need Additional Financing, Which May Not Be Available, for Strategic Growth Opportunities If we are unable to raise capital in the future when needed, we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities. In the future, we may require significant capital expenditures for strategic growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, and after giving effect to the 2007 Term Loan and the January 2007 Stock Purchase, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $139.4 million and restricted cash of $137.5 million. In addition, we have $250.0 million of availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility (2007 Revolver). We may need additional sources of debt or equity capital in the future to fund future growth opportunities. Additional financing may be unavailable, may be prohibitively expensive, or may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Additional sales of equity securities would dilute our existing stockholders. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities. Modeos Business Has Certain Risk Factors Different from our Core Tower Business, Including an Unproven Business Model Modeos business may fail to operate successfully and produce results that are less than anticipated. Modeo is a new company with no operating history and may not be able to operate successfully. Modeo has an unproven business model and operates in the new, largely untested and rapidly evolving mobile media market. Modeo is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise. Modeo has had no revenues since inception. We expect Modeo to experience initial operating losses due to the costs and expenses associated with a start up operation. No assurance can be made that Modeo will ever generate positive cash flows or that losses recorded from Modeo will not increase in the future. 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Modeos planned business model assumptions include: wireless carriers and other potential retailers will want to offer Modeos service to their customers; a sufficient number of end users of wireless handsets and other mobile devices will subscribe to Modeos service; an adequate supply of wireless handsets and other mobile devices capable of operating on Modeos network will be timely available; and Modeo will be able to secure video and audio content licenses on favorable terms. If any of the assumptions is incorrect, Modeos proposed business will be harmed and may not become commercially available or survive. In addition, Modeos ability to achieve its strategic objectives will depend in large part upon the successful, timely and cost effective completion of a DVB H network beyond New York City. A variety of factors, uncertainties and contingencies could affect or prevent the successful, timely and cost effective build out of the planned Modeo network including: Modeos ability to wholesale its service to wireless carriers and other potential retailers; Modeos ability to obtain sufficient base station and broadcast equipment devices compatible with our spectrum license and DVB H; unforeseen delays, costs or impediments relating to the granting of state and municipal permits; Modeos ability to manage the build out effectively and cost efficiently; delays or disruptions resulting from the failure of third party suppliers, including equipment manufacturers, or contractors to meet their obligations in a timely and cost effective manner; and unsuccessful operation of, or the receipt of negative results or feedback relating to, our New York City network beta service. We continue to evaluate the potential options for funding the build out of the Modeo network beyond New York City, which include: non recourse debt secured by our 1670 1675 MHz spectrum license, equity investors in Modeo, joint venture proposals, proposals to sell a controlling interest in Modeo along with a combination of the above. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional third party financing on terms acceptable to us or that Modeo will be able to complete a DVB H network beyond New York City in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital from third party investors on acceptable terms in a timely manner or if Modeo is otherwise unable to meet its network development targets, then Modeo may not be able to implement its current business plan, and Modeos planned mobile media service may not become operationally active or commercially available. Many other companies, some with significantly greater resources than us, currently offer or plan to offer video and audio content to wireless handsets and other mobile devices. Although Modeos planned services are not yet commercially available, Modeo competes with these other offerings in bringing its service to commercial availability. If and when Modeos planned service becomes commercially available, Modeo will compete with these offerings in capturing potential subscribers and market share. Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless) and Verizon Wireless currently offer streaming video services over their networks under the brand names Sprint TV, MobiTV and Vcast, respectively. In addition, Qualcomm has announced that it is developing a multicast digital video service, marketed under the brand name MediaFLO. Verizon Wireless and AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless) have announced that they plan to offer their customers mobile video services over the MediaFLO network. Modeos planned service offering may also face competition from other companies offering podcasting and alternate methods of distributing video and audio to mobile devices. As a result of such competition, Modeo may not become viable or gain market share. There can be no assurances that wireless carriers will adopt a wholesale model, such as Modeos, to provide video and audio services to their subscribers. Modeos failure to operate successfully or accomplish its strategic 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements objectives could negatively impact Modeos ability to generate positive cash flow, could require us to dispose of all or part of Modeos business and assets, including the FCC spectrum license, or otherwise have an adverse effect on us. FiberTowers Business Has Certain Risk Factors Different from our Core Tower Business, Including an Unproven Business Model FiberTowers business may produce results that are less than anticipated, resulting in a write off of all or part of our investment in FiberTower. FiberTower commenced its principal operations in 2003 and has a limited operating history. FiberTower has an unproven business model and operates in the new and largely untested market for facilities based wireless backhaul services. As such, FiberTower is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise and may not be able to operate successfully. FiberTower has generated losses since inception. We anticipate that FiberTower will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future and may need additional funding to support the development of its business model. Although we believe that there will be demand for the backhaul solutions FiberTower provides to wireless carriers as the demand for additional wireless minutes of use increases, no assurances can be made that FiberTower will ever generate positive cash flows or that it will produce the results anticipated at the time of our investment. In addition, as a minority shareholder, we have a limited ability to affect FiberTowers operations. Additional risk factors relating to FiberTowers business can be found in FiberTowers filings with the SEC. Our investment in FiberTower is classified as an available for sale security, carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. The net unrealized gains or losses on our investment as a result of fluctuations in FiberTowers share price are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income unless such changes are deemed other than temporary. FiberTowers failure to operate successfully, gain market share or accomplish its strategic objectives could negatively impact FiberTowers per share price and could require us to write off all or a portion of our investment in FiberTower. As of January 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in FiberTower was $137.8 million (at $5.23 per FiberTower share). As of January 31, 2007, the unrealized investment gain included in accumulated other comprehensive income totaled $2.1 million or equivalent to $0.08 per FiberTower share. Although we currently have no plans to do so, should we choose to liquidate our investment in FiberTower, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to do so at a desirable value. In addition, our investment in FiberTower is subject to certain transfer restrictions that terminate in August 2007 or earlier in some cases. Laws and Regulations, Which May Change at Any Time and With Which We May Fail to Comply, Regulate Our Business If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business. A variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. We cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including state and local tax laws, will not adversely affect our business, increase delays or result in additional costs. These factors may have a material adverse effect on us. Shares Eligible For Future Sale Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of February 20, 2007, we had 282.8 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, we have reserved (1) 16.5 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans, (2) 1.2 million shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants, inclusive of 0.6 million shares of common stock as a result of the Global Signal Merger, (3) 5.9 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our 4% Convertible Senior Notes and (4) 8.6 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock. A small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, we have filed with the SEC a registration statement covering certain shares of common stock issued to the Global Signal Significant Stockholders in the Global Signal Merger. The Global 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Signal Significant Stockholders are subject to certain restrictions on their ability to sell or otherwise dispose of their shares of common stock for a period of up to 180 days after the closing of the Global Signal Merger. If any one of these stockholders, or any group of our stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline. The holders of our 6.25% convertible preferred stock (6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock) are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 6.25% per annum (approximately $19.9 million per annum) payable on a quarterly basis. We have the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock. At various times in the past, we have paid such dividends with shares of common stock, and we may elect to do so again in the future from time to time. The number of shares of common stock required to be issued to pay such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend is required to be paid. We Are Heavily Dependent on Our Senior Management If we lose members of our senior management, we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our business may be adversely affected. Our existing operations and continued future development depend to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of certain key individuals as employees, including our chief executive officer. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these or other key personnel. If we were to lose any of these individuals, we may not be able to find or integrate appropriate replacements on a timely basis, and we may be materially adversely affected. Variability in Demand For Network Services Business Reduces the Predictability of Our Results Our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand. The operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer term results for this activity. Network services revenues declined as a percentage of our total revenues during 2003 and 2004, reflecting our efforts to de emphasize this area of our business and increased competition, while such revenues increased modestly in 2005 and 2006. In the foreseeable future, network services revenues may decline as a percentage of our total revenues due to our focus on our core leasing business, increased competition or other factors. Emissions From Antennas on Our Towers or Wireless Devices May Create Health Risks If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs and revenues. The FCC and other government agencies impose requirements and other guidelines on their licensees relating to radio frequency emissions. The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us. Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services. If a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Anti Takeover Provisions in Our Certificate of Incorporation and Competition Laws May Have Effects That Conflict with the Interests of Our Stockholders Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by laws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to you. We have a number of anti takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock. Our anti takeover provisions include: a staggered Board of Directors; a shareholder rights agreement; the authority of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock; and advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings. Our by laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of a majority of the Board of Directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. Such provisions, as well as the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. In addition, domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. Our Operations Outside the U.S. Expose Us to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We may suffer losses as a result of changes in such currency exchange rates. After giving effect to the Global Signal Merger, we conduct business in Australia, Canada and United Kingdom, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 9.3% of our consolidated revenues originated outside the U.S., all of which were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, principally Australian dollars. We have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our non U.S. dollar operations, and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates. Approximately 1% of the revenue expected to be realized from the Global Signal business will be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

The principal responsibilities of these offices are to manage the leasing of tower space on a local basis, maintain the towers already located in the area and service our customers in the area. In addition, we lease additional, smaller district offices, which report to the Area Offices, in locations with high tower concentrations. We anticipate the expansion of certain Area Offices and district offices in 2007 as a result of the Global Signal Merger. In the CCUSA portfolio, Post Merger, 18.4% of the towers are guyed towers, 34.6% are self support lattice towers, 1.2% are rooftop installations and the remaining 45.5% are predominantly monopoles. Typical guyed towers are generally located on larger tracts of land of up to 7 acres, while non guyed towers are generally located on smaller tracts of land that typically range from approximately 1,600 to 22,000 square feet. These tracts of land support the towers, equipment shelters and, where applicable, guy wires to stabilize the structure. The actual square footage of the land relating to any particular tower depends on a number of things, including the topography of the site, the size of the area the landlord is willing to lease, the number of customers locating on the tower and the type of structure at the site. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, we own in fee or have permanent or long term easements in the land on which 3,926 of our CCUSA towers reside, or approximately 17.6% of our CCUSA portfolio, and we lease, sublease or license the land on which 17,611 of our CCUSA towers reside. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, CCUSA managed 737 towers owned by third parties where we had the right to market space on the tower or where we had sublease arrangements with the tower owner. In Australia, as of December 31, 2006, for 1,383 of our 1,387 CCAL towers site tenure of the land under our towers takes the form of a lease or license, and we own the remaining four sites in fee. Our ground leases, subleases and licenses generally have five or 10 year initial terms at CCUSA and 10 to 15 years at CCAL, and frequently contain one or more renewal options. For a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to expiration (including any renewal terms at our option) of the ground leases, subleases, or licenses for the CCUSA land which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Competition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Cash Obligations. In 2004, we began a program (Portfolio Extension Program) through which we seek to (1) renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases, subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our CCUSA towers are located or (2) purchase the land on which such towers reside. Global Signal had an ongoing initiative similar to the Portfolio Extension Program, which we expect to continue after the Global Signal Merger. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We Generally Lease or Sublease the Land Under Our Towers and May Not Be Able to Extend These Leases. On June 8, 2005, we issued $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of 2005 Tower Revenue Notes. On November 29, 2006, we issued $1.55 billion aggregate principal amount of 2006 Tower Revenue Notes as additional debt securities under the existing indenture pursuant to which the 2005 Tower Revenue Notes were issued in 2005. The 2005 Tower Revenue Notes and 2006 Tower Revenue Notes are effectively secured by 6,639 of our CCUSA towers and the cash flows from those towers. Governing instruments related to another 4,901 towers prevent liens from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of Verizon; however, distributions paid from the entities that own those towers will also service these notes. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Approximately 8,975 of the 10,749 towers acquired as a result of the Global Signal Merger and the cash flows from those towers are effectively pledged as security for debt of Global Signal consisting of the Commercial Mortgage Pass through Certificates, Series 2004 2 (2004 Mortgage Loan) and the Commercial Mortgage Pass through Certificates, Series 2006 1 (2006 Mortgage Loan). The 2004 Mortgage Loan and the 2006 Mortgage Loan remain outstanding as obligations of the Global Signal entities we acquired in the Global Signal Merger. Substantially all of our CCUSA towers can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the tower. Additionally, if so inclined as a result of customer demand, we could generally also tear down an existing tower and reconstruct another tower in its place with additional capacity, subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, the weighted average number of tenants per tower is approximately 2.50 on our 22,274 CCUSA towers, including rooftop installations. A summary of the number of existing tenants per tower as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, is as follows: Number of Tenants Number of Towers Greater than five 1,200 Five 1,177 Four 2,324 Three 3,862 Two 5,688 Less than two 8,023 22,274 Ite m 3. Legal Proceedings We are periodically involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business along with a shareholder derivative lawsuit as described below. Most of these proceedings, arising in the ordinary course of business, involve disputes with landlords, vendors, collection matters involving bankrupt customers, zoning and variance matters, condemnation or wrongful termination claims. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect any pending matters to have a material adverse effect on us. We know of five shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in 2006 in Texas state courts against various of our current and former directors and officers. The lawsuits all made allegations relating to our historic stock option practices and allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar matters. Among the forms of relief, the lawsuits seek alleged monetary damages sustained by CCIC. The plaintiffs have named CCIC as a nominal defendant and ostensibly bring the lawsuits on CCICs behalf. In December 2006 an order to consolidate the lawsuits into a single action and appoint lead plaintiffs counsel was entered. In February 2007, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated Petition styled In Re Crown Castle International Corp. Derivative Litigation, Cause No. 2006 49592; in the 234th Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas. Item 4. Submissions of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders On January 11, 2007 at a special meeting, the stockholders of the Company provided an affirmative vote to approve the issuance of common stock to stockholders of Global Signal pursuant to the Global Signal Merger.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Price Range of Common Stock Our common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol CCI. The following table sets forth for the calendar periods indicated the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by NYSE. High Low 2005: First Quarter $ 17.52 $ 15.40 Second Quarter 20.75 15.71 Third Quarter 25.43 19.81 Fourth Quarter 29.20 23.47 2006: First Quarter $ 32.77 $ 26.41 Second Quarter 34.93 27.45 Third Quarter 35.83 32.23 Fourth Quarter 35.29 31.84 As of February 20, 2007, there were approximately 797 holders of record of our common stock. Dividend Policy We have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock. It is our current policy to retain our cash provided by operating activities to finance the expansion of our operations, to reduce our debt or to purchase our own stock (either common or preferred). Future declaration and payment of cash dividends, if any, will be determined in light of the then current conditions, including our earnings, cash flow from operations, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by the terms of our debt instruments under certain circumstances and the terms of the certificates of designations in respect of our convertible preferred stock. The holders of our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 6.25% per annum, payable on a quarterly basis. We have the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock. The number of shares of common stock required to be issued to pay such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend is required to be paid. For the year ended December 31, 2004, dividends on our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 1,498,361 shares of common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, dividends on our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 631,700 and 0 shares of common stock, respectively, and approximately $9,939,000 and $19,877,000 in cash, respectively. On November 30, 2005, we exercised our redemption right for our $200 million 8 1/4% convertible preferred stock (8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock). On December 16, 2005, we redeemed the 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock. Prior to the redemption, the holders of our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 8 1/4% per annum, payable on a quarterly basis. Prior to redemption, we had the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock. The number of 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements shares required to pay such dividends was dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend was required to be paid. For the years ended December 31, 2004, dividends on our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 1,140,000 shares of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2005, dividends on our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 245,000 shares of common stock and approximately $12,375,000 in cash. Any shares of common stock issued to pay such dividends will continue to have a dilutive effect upon the shares of common stock otherwise outstanding, and declines in the fair market value of our common stock will increase the effective dilution. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, we purchased 845,000, 245,000 and 0 shares of common stock, respectively, from the dividend paying agent for a total of $12.2 million, $4.1 million and $ 0 in cash, respectively. We have also purchased shares of common stock on other occasions (see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources). We may choose to continue cash payments of the dividends in the future in order to avoid dilution caused by the issuance of common stock as dividends on our preferred stock. Issuance of Unregistered Securities Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities On May 10, 2006, we issued an aggregate of 38,196 unregistered shares of common stock to two holders of our outstanding warrants upon the cashless exercise of warrants to purchase 50,270 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.508 per share. We issued the shares in reliance upon exemptions from registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including Section 3(a)(9) and Section 4(2) therein. Equity Compensation Plans Certain information with respect to our equity compensation plans is set forth in Item 12 herein.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview. Further, we are pursuing other strategic opportunities, or adjacent businesses, which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to achieve acceptable risk adjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our existing assets and expertise, as evidenced by our investments in Modeo and FiberTower. See Item 1. Business The Company Emerging Businesses. 2006 Highlights and Recent Developments During 2006, we engaged in a number of significant activities consistent with our strategy, including entering into a definitive agreement to acquire Global Signal, the purchase of shares of our common stock (common stock), the refinancing and issuance of indebtedness and the acquisition of Mountain Union Telecom, LLC (Mountain Union). The Global Signal Merger is discussed below under Item 1. Business Global Signal Merger. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Overview for a summary description of the highlights of such other activities occurring in 2006 and the beginning of 2007. Global Signal Merger On October 5, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement (Merger Agreement) which contemplated the merger of Global Signal into a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. Global Signal operated 10,749 towers, primarily concentrated in the southwestern, midwestern, Pacific coast and northeastern regions of the U.S. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on January 12, 2007, Global Signal was merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.0 billion, exclusive of debt of approximately $1.8 billion that remained outstanding as obligations of the Global Signal entities acquired. As a result of the completion of Global Signal Merger, we issued approximately 98.1 million shares of common stock and paid the maximum $550.0 million in cash (Cash Consideration) to the stockholders of Global Signal and reserved for issuance approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock issuable pursuant to Global Signal warrants. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Global Signal common stockholders were entitled to convert each share of Global Signal common stock into 1.61 shares of our common stock or, alternatively, could elect to receive cash in the amount of $55.95 per Global Signal share. Following the Global Signal Merger, the former Global Signal stockholders owned approximately 32.7% of our outstanding shares. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Current Year Highlights and Recent Developments, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 1. Business The Company CCUSA. Upon closing of the Global Signal Merger, Global Signals subsidiaries had debt outstanding of approximately $1.8 billion (all of which remained outstanding as obligations of the Global Signal entities we acquired) having a structure similar to the $1.9 billion in notes issued through certain of our subsidiaries in June 2005 (2005 Tower Revenue Notes) and the $1.55 billion in notes issued through certain of our subsidiaries in November 2006 (2006 Tower Revenue Notes). As a result, we have significantly increased our interest expense. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities. Global Signal revenues, cost of operations and gross margins for 2006 were approximately $500 million (unaudited), $225 million (unaudited) and $275 million (unaudited), respectively. We entered into the Global Signal Merger primarily because of the growth opportunities we anticipate the Global Signal tower portfolio will provide, including through the leveraging of our management team and customer service across an enhanced national footprint. We believe the anticipated opportunities for growth will be driven by the carrier focus on improving network quality, subscriber growth, increasing subscriber usage, wireline replacement and next generation network 5 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements builds. See "Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Overview." Secondarily, we believe there will be synergistic opportunities provided by the Global Signal Merger. In 2007, as a result of the Global Signal Merger, we do expect a substantial increase in our general and administrative expenses from 2006, but we also anticipate a decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue. We also expect to incur a substantial amount of costs to integrate Global Signal into our internal control structure and operations. Stockholders Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we entered into a stockholders agreement (Stockholders Agreement) with (1) certain investment funds affiliated with Fortress Investment Group LLC (collectively, Fortress), (2) Greenhill Capital Partners, L.P. and certain of its related partnerships (collectively, Greenhill), and (3) Abrams Capital Partners II, L.P. and certain of its related partnerships (collectively, Abrams Capital, and together with Fortress and Greenhill, the Global Signal Significant Stockholders). Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, we have filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC registering certain shares of our common stock received by the Global Signal Significant Stockholders in the merger (Merger Shares). In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Global Signal Significant Stockholders (and certain of their affiliates) (1) have a limited number of demands for us to register their Merger Shares and (2) will be able to have their respective Merger Shares registered whenever we propose to register our equity securities. In lieu of Global Signal Significant Stockholders right to require us to conduct a marketed secondary offering of certain of their Merger Shares within 90 days after the merger, on January 19, 2007, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the Global Signal Significant Stockholders, pursuant to which we purchased an aggregate of 17.7 million shares of our common stock from the Global Signal Significant Stockholders (January 2007 Stock Purchase). See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Overview Current Year Highlights and Recent Developments. As required by the Stockholders Agreement, we have appointed a representative of each of the Global Signal Significant Stockholders to our Board of Directors. Wesley R. Edens, Robert H. Niehaus and David C. Abrams were appointed to the Board of Directors as representatives of Fortress, Greenhill and Abrams Capital, respectively. Each Global Signal Stockholder has a one time right to re nominate its designated director (or another individual reasonably acceptable to us) if such Global Signal Stockholder owns more than 3.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of such re nomination. The Company We operate our business primarily in the U.S. (including Puerto Rico) and Australia, with limited additional operations in Canada and the U. K. We conduct our operations principally through subsidiaries of Crown Castle Operating Company (CCOC), including (1) certain subsidiaries which operate our tower portfolios in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada (referred to as CCUSA) and (2) a joint venture in which we have a 77.6% interest that operates our Australia tower portfolio (referred to as CCAL). For more information about our operating segments, as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and the section entitled Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below. CCUSA Overview The primary business of CCUSA is the leasing of antenna space on multiple tenant towers to a variety of customers under long term leases. Supporting our competitive position in the site rental business, we offer our customers certain network services relating to our towers, including antenna installations and other services. At December 31, 2006, Post Merger, CCUSA owned, leased or managed 22,274 towers, including rooftop installations. Although we own, lease or manage 252 towers located in Puerto Rico and Canada that are included in CCUSA, our towers are primarily located throughout the U.S. The U.S. towers are located predominantly in the northeast, southeast, midwest, southwest and Pacific coast regions of the U.S. Most of our towers were acquired 6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements through transactions consummated within the past eight years, including through transactions with Global Signal, Bell Atlantic Mobile and GTE Wireless (both now part of Verizon Wireless), BellSouth Mobility and BellSouth DCS (both now part of AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless)) and Powertel (now a part of T Mobile). Through the Global Signal Merger, which closed on January 12, 2007, we acquired 10,749 towers which are located primarily in the U.S. Of the 10,749 towers Global Signal operated and which we now operate, 6,553 towers (Sprint Towers) are to be leased or operated for a period of 32 years (through May 2037) under master leases and subleases (Sprint Master Leases) with Sprint Corporation (a predecessor of Sprint Nextel) and certain subsidiaries of Sprint Corporation entered into in May 2005. Global Signal prepaid the rent owed under the Sprint Master Leases in May 2005. During the period commencing one year prior to the expiration of the Sprint Master Leases and ending 120 days prior to expiration, Post Merger we have the option to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Sprint Towers then leased for approximately $2.3 billion. Post Merger we are entitled to all revenue from the Sprint Towers during the term of the Sprint Master Leases, including amounts payable under existing leases with third parties. In addition, under the Sprint Master Leases, certain Sprint Corporation subsidiaries have agreed to sublease space on substantially all of the Sprint Towers for an initial period of 10 years. At the closing of the Global Signal Merger, the Sprint Master Leases remained effective as an asset and commitment of the Global Signal entities we acquired. Prior to the Global Signal Merger, our communication towers were primarily acquired in transactions beginning in 1998 through 2000, including the following transactions: Acquisition Transaction Closing Dates No. of CurrentCommunicationTowers Primary Tower Locations Bell Atlantic Mobile March 1999 2,020 Eastern, Southwestern U.S. GTE Wireless January September 2000 (a) 2,881 Eastern, Midwestern, Southwestern and Pacific Coast areas of the U.S. Bell South Mobility and Bell South DCS June 1999 December 2000(b) 3,046 Southeastern and Midwestern U.S. Powertel June 1999 675 Southeastern U.S. Trintel Communications Inc. August 2005 467 Midwestern U.S. Mountain Union Telecom, LLC July 2006 474 (c) Puerto Rico and Southern U.S. (a) The towers from GTE wireless were acquired in tranches from January 2000 through September 2000. (b) The towers from Bell South Mobility and Bell South DCS were acquired in tranches from June 1999 through December 2000. (c) The tower count is exclusive of 77 towers in various stages of development as of July 2006. We plan to continue to structurally enhance our existing towers and selectively build or acquire strategically located towers which meet certain economic criteria on a limited basis. To reduce risk and speculation, in connection with building towers, we generally look for towers with multiple tenant demand and obtain lease commitments from customers prior to building such towers. Further, the towers are constructed to accommodate multiple tenants in order to obviate the need for later structural enhancement, saving capital and time for our customers. Site Rental CCUSA rents antenna space on its towers to a variety of carriers operating cellular, PCS, ESMR, 3G, wireless data services, paging and other networks. The number of antennae that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the towers location, height and structural capacity. We generally receive monthly rental payments from customers, payable under site leases. The new leases at CCUSA recently entered into by us typically have original terms of seven to 10 years (with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each) and provide for annual price increases based upon a consumer price index, a fixed percentage or a combination thereof. The lease agreements with our customers relating to tower network 7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements acquisitions generally have an original term of 10 years, with multiple renewal options, each typically ranging from five to 10 years. We have existing master lease agreements with most major wireless carriers, including Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile, which provide certain terms (including economic terms) that govern leases on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements. The average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies among the different regions in the U.S. and the type of service being provided by the tenant, with broadband tenants (such as PCS) paying more than narrowband tenants (such as paging), primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation. In addition, we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments which authorize carriers to add additional antennas or other equipment to towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to pre existing lease agreements. Network Services We also provide network services, on a limited basis, primarily relating to our towers for our customers. Our service offering consists of antenna installations and subsequent augmentation, network design and site selection, site acquisition, site development and other services. Customers In both the CCUSA site rental and network services businesses, we work with a number of customers in a variety of businesses including cellular, PCS, ESMR, 3G, wireless data services and paging. We work extensively with large national wireless carriers such as Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile. For the year ended December 31, 2006, these four carriers, accounted for approximately 72.7% of CCUSAs revenues and 67.2% of our consolidated revenues, with Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile accounting for 16.0%, 25.4%, 22.0%, and 9.3%, respectively, of CCUSAs revenues and 14.8%, 23.5%, 20.3%, and 8.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, on a pro forma basis as if the Global Signal Merger was completed January 1, 2006, approximately 68.3% of our total combined revenues was derived from Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile, with such customers representing 24.2%, 20.4%, 15.3%, and 8.4% of our combined consolidated revenues, respectively. No other single customer of CCUSA accounted for more than 10.0% of our 2006 consolidated revenues. See Item 1A. Risk Factors A Substantial Portion of Our Revenues is Derived From a Small Number of Customers. Sales and Marketing The CCUSA sales organization markets our towers within the wireless telecommunications industry. We seek to become the preferred independent tower provider for our customers. We use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network build outs, modifications, site additions and network services. Information about carriers existing location of antenna space, leases, marketing strategies, capital spend plans, deployment status, and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field is analyzed to match specific towers in our portfolios with potential new site demand. In addition, we have developed patented property management tools and software which allow us to estimate site leasing demand with greater speed and accuracy. Through these and other tools we have developed, we seek to determine potential demand for our towers, allowing for proactive discussions with our carrier customers regarding these towers and the timing of their demand. A team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers. These directors work to develop new tower leasing opportunities, network services contracts and site management opportunities, as well as to ensure that customers tower needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our towers. Sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with carriers that are expanding their networks, entering new markets, bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or add on business. We target numerous types of customers, including cellular, PCS, ESMR, 3G, wireless data, paging and government agencies. Our objective is to lease space on existing towers and pre sell capacity on our new towers prior to construction. 8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition to our full time sales and marketing staff, a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers. Competition CCUSA competes with other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services; wireless carriers which build, own and operate their own tower networks; broadcasters with respect to their broadcast towers; building owners that lease antenna space on rooftop sites; and other potential competitors, such as utilities and outdoor advertisers, some of which actively participate in the site rental industry. Wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have. We believe that tower location, deployment speed, capacity, quality of service and price has been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower. Some of the larger independent tower companies with which CCUSA competes in the U.S. include American Tower Corporation, SBA Communications Corporation and Global Tower Partners. Significant additional site rental competition comes from the leasing of rooftops, utility structures and other alternative sites for antennas. Competitors in the network services business include site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right of way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors, and our customers internal staffs. We believe that carriers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience, track record, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We Operate Our Business In a Competitive Industry and Some of Our Competitors Have Significantly More Resources or Less Debt Than We Do. CCAL Our primary business in Australia is the leasing of antenna space on towers to our customers. CCAL, a joint venture which is owned 77.6% by us and 22.4% by Permanent Nominees (Aust) Ltd, acting on behalf of a group of professional and institutional investors led by Jump Capital Limited, is our principal Australian operating subsidiary. CCAL is the largest independent tower operator in Australia. As of December 31, 2006, CCAL had 1,387 towers, with a strategic presence in each of Australias major metropolitan areas, including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. For the year ended December 31, 2006, CCAL comprised 7.6% of our consolidated revenues. CCALs principal customers are Optus, Vodafone Australia, Hutchison and Telstra. For the year ended December 31, 2006, these four carriers accounted for approximately 94.4% of CCALs revenues, with Vodafone Australia and Optus accounting for 34.5% and 34.1%, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors A Substantial Portion of Our Revenues is Derived From a Small Number of Customers. The majority of CCAL towers were acquired from Optus and Vodafone Australia in 2000 and 2001, respectively. In connection with these transactions, Optus agreed to lease space on the former Optus towers for an initial term of 15 years, and Vodafone Australia agreed to lease space on the former Vodafone Australia towers for an initial rent free term of 10 years. In Australia, CCAL competes with wireless carriers, which own and operate their own tower networks; service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services; and other site owners, such as broadcasters and building owners. The two other significant tower owners in Australia are Broadcast Australia and Telstra. We believe that tower location, capacity, quality of service, deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a site. Several 3G networks continue to be developed in Australia. Two metropolitan networks are being built by joint ventures between Hutchison and Telstra and between Optus and Vodafone Australia, respectively. In addition, 9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Telstra has constructed the first phase of a new national 3G network, which is currently not shared with Hutchison, to replace one of its existing networks. The Telstra network was launched commercially in October 2006. Each of the 3G networks has already utilized a number of our towers in connection with its deployment, and we expect more of our towers will be utilized by each of the networks in 2007. In addition, Optus recently announced plans to provide nationwide 3G coverage with deployment commencing in 2007. Unwired Australia and Personal Broadband Australia also continued their deployment of broadband wireless networks (providing high speed internet services to consumers) in 2006, which are currently operating in key metropolitan markets. Emerging Businesses We have pursued and are currently pursuing other strategic opportunities, or adjacent businesses, which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to achieve acceptable risk adjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our core tower rental business. Such emerging adjacent businesses currently consist of Modeo. Modeo was formed in 2004 to explore a potential offering of live digital television and audio broadcast and podcasting to mobile devices, such as wireless phones. Modeo plans to offer this service as a wholesale network provider, utilizing the spectrum under our 1670 1675 MHz U.S. nationwide spectrum license (having an initial term of 10 years), which we acquired in 2003 through a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction. Modeo broadcasts its service using the Digital Video Broadcast to Handheld (DVB H) standard, the open standard for the broadcast of digital television to mobile devices. Modeo has had no revenues since inception. During 2006, Modeo completed the development of a commercial grade mobile television DVB H network in New York City. In December 2006, Modeo launched a live, commercial quality mobile television beta service in New York City that includes live video content from leading network programmers as well as streaming audio content. Modeo plans to stage its New York beta activities in phases throughout the first and second quarters of 2007, which will include establishing a formal beta test group. After we have received and evaluated the feedback from these beta activities, we will review and evaluate our options for expanding the Modeo network beyond New York City. We continue to evaluate the potential options for funding the build out of the Modeo network beyond New York City, which include: non recourse debt secured by our 1670 1675 MHz spectrum license, equity investors in Modeo, joint venture proposals, proposals to sell a controlling interest in Modeo along with a combination of the above. Many other companies, some with significantly greater resources than us, offer or plan to offer video and audio content to wireless handsets and other mobile devices. Although Modeos planned services are not yet commercially available, Modeo competes with these other offerings in bringing its service to commercial availability. If and when Modeos planned service becomes commercially available, Modeo will compete with these offerings to capture potential subscribers and market share. In particular, Qualcomm has announced that it is currently developing a multicast digital video service, marketed under the brand name MediaFLO. Verizon Wireless and AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless) have announced that they plan to offer their customers mobile video services over the MediaFLO network. In addition, Modeo may face competition from other companies offering podcasting and alternate methods of distributing video and audio to handheld devices. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Modeos Business Has Certain Risk Factors Different from our Core Tower Business, Including an Unproven Business Model. Employees At February 20, 2007, we employed approximately 1,160 people worldwide, inclusive of approximately 210 people previously employed by Global Signal who are providing services only during the integration of the Global Signal business. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages, and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory. Regulatory Matters To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations. The summary below is based on regulations currently in effect, and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Laws and Regulations, Which May Change at Any Time and With Which We May Fail to Comply, Regulate Our Business. 10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements United States Federal Regulations Both the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulate towers used for wireless communications transmitters and receivers. Such regulations control the siting and marking of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require the registration of tower facilities and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic. Wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used. In addition, the FCC and the FAA have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location, including proximity to airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation, which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements. The FCC requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with FAA rules and are registered with the FCC, if required by its regulations. Where tower lighting is required by FAA regulation, tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any tower lighting outage. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties. Local Regulations The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers. The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services. Additionally, the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radiofrequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Local regulations include city and other local ordinances (including subdivision and zoning ordinances), approvals for construction, modification and removal of towers, and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly, but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction. Local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height, visibility and other characteristics of the towers. Other Regulations We hold, through certain of our subsidiaries, certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the FCC, including licenses for common carrier microwave service, commercial and private mobile radio service, specialized mobile radio and paging service, which are subject to additional regulation by the FCC. Our FCC license relating to the 1670 to 1675 MHz spectrum band contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder, the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed. We are required to obtain the FCCs approval prior to assigning or transferring control of any of our FCC licenses. Australia Federal Regulation Carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the Australian Telecommunications Act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public. The definition of network units includes line links and base stations used for wireless telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure. Accordingly, CCAL as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license. Similarly, because CCAL does not own any transmitters or spectrum, it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the Australian Radiocommunications Act 1992. 11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers, and, if there is a dispute (including a pricing dispute), the matter may be referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for resolution. As a non carrier, CCAL is not subject to this regime, and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis. While the Australian Telecommunications Act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities, newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities. Accordingly, in connection with the construction of towers, CCAL is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site basis. Structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general maintenance power under the Australian Telecommunications Act 1997, although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if CCAL is unable to obtain carrier co operation to use that legislative power. For a limited number of towers, CCAL is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations. In Australia, a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the maintenance power under the Australian Telecommunications Act of 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease; however, CCALs customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this, and, even if a carrier did utilize this power, the carrier would be required to pay for CCALs financial loss, which would roughly equal the tower rental that would have otherwise been payable. Local Regulations In Australia there are various local, state and territory laws and regulations which relate to, among other things, town planning and zoning restrictions, standards and approvals for the design, construction or alteration of a structure or facility, and environmental regulations. As in the U.S., these laws vary greatly, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis. Environmental Matters To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Laws and Regulations, Which May Change at Any Time and With Which We May Fail to Comply, Regulate Our Business and Emissions From Antennas on Our Towers or Wireless Devices May Create Health Risks. The construction of new towers in the U.S. may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions. The FCC has promulgated regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction. Should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact, the FCC must prepare an environmental impact statement, subject to public comment. If a proposed tower may have a significant impact on the environment, the FCCs approval of the construction could be significantly delayed. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission, and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As an owner, lessee or operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on site or off site contamination relating to existing or historical operations, and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination. We are potentially subject to environmental and cleanup liabilities in the U.S. and Australia. As licensees and tower owners, we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions. As employers, we are subject to OSHA (and similar occupational health and safety legislation in Australia) and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements radio frequency exposure. The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us. Ite m 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investment in our securities. Global Signal Merger The Global Signal Merger may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The Global Signal Merger could cause disruptions in or otherwise negatively impact our business. Among other things: the business combination of Global Signal with us may disrupt our business relationships with our customers, who may delay or defer decisions about current and future agreements with us because of the merger; current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key managers and other employees; and the attention of management may be directed toward the integration of Global Signal with us and away from other business operations. Performance of Assets Acquired in the Global Signal Merger The assets acquired in the Global Signal Merger may not perform as expected, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In evaluating the anticipated benefits of a potential transaction with Global Signal, we performed due diligence on Global Signals tower portfolio and other assets to be acquired in the Global Signal Merger, which due diligence included, among other things, analyzing tower locations, visiting select towers, evaluating radio frequency information, and evaluating potential carrier customer demand. The results of this due diligence were used to support assumptions that were made by us in creating financial models to evaluate the potential future performance of Global Signals assets and the combined company. There can be no assurances that the towers and other assets of Global Signal will perform as expected by us based on our due diligence and provide us with the benefits that have been anticipated. A variety of factors could cause these assets not to provide such benefits, including, among other things: the inability to procure additional ground space at existing tower locations; local and state restrictions on the ability to modify such towers; and latent structural weaknesses associated with such towers and the related cost of repairing, reinforcing or upgrading them. If Global Signals assets fail to perform as expected or we fail to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of Global Signals assets for these or other reasons, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Integration of Global Signal The integration of Global Signal is expected to result in substantial expenses and may present significant challenges. We may face significant challenges in combining Global Signals operations in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key Global Signal personnel. This integration will be complex and time consuming. The failure to successfully integrate Global Signals business and to manage the challenges presented by the integration process successfully, including the retention of key Global Signal personnel, may result in us and our stockholders not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the Global Signal Merger. Achieving the benefits of the Global Signal Merger will depend in part on the integration of Global Signals operations, wireless communications tower portfolio and personnel in a timely and efficient manner and our ability to realize the anticipated synergies from this integration. This integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among others, the size of Global Signals wireless communications tower portfolio and because Global Signals and our internal systems and processes were developed without regard to such integration. Successful integration of Global Signal also requires coordination of personnel, which may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and differences in policies, procedures and operations between the companies and the different geographical locations of the companies and their assets. If the integration is not successful, we might not realize the expected benefits of the merger, which could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock after the merger. We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the Global Signal business into our policies, procedures, operations and systems. There are a large number of systems that must be integrated, including management information, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll and benefits, lease administration systems and regulatory compliance. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the Global Signal business may offset incremental transaction, merger related and restructuring costs over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all, and there are a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses. Our Business Depends on the Demand for Wireless Communications and Towers We may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand, including a slowdown attributable to wireless carrier consolidation or by the sharing of networks by wireless carriers. Demand for our towers depends on demand for antenna space from our customers, which, in turn, depends on the demand for wireless services. The willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure, or renew existing leases on our towers, will be affected by numerous factors, including: consumer demand for wireless services; availability and location of our towers and alternative towers; cost of capital, including interest rates; availability of capital to our customers; willingness to co locate equipment; local and state restrictions on the proliferation of towers; cost of building towers; technological changes affecting the number or type of communications sites needed to provide wireless communications services to a given geographic area; our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers service requirements; and tax policies. A slowdown in demand for a particular wireless segment may adversely affect the demand for our towers. Moreover, some wireless carriers operate with substantial indebtedness, and financial problems for our customers may result in accounts receivable going uncollected, the loss of a customer (and associated lease revenue) or a reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities. 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements A slowdown in the deployment of equipment for new wireless technologies, the consolidation of wireless carriers, the sharing of networks by wireless carriers or the increased use of alternative sites may also adversely affect the demand for our towers. In addition, advances in technology, such as the development of new antenna systems, new terrestrial deployment technologies and new satellite systems, may reduce the need for land based, or terrestrial, transmission networks or our towers. To some extent, almost all of the above factors have occurred in recent years with an adverse effect on our business, and such factors are likely to persist in the future. The occurrence of any of these factors may negatively impact our revenues, result in an impairment of our assets or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. A Substantial Portion of Our Revenues is Derived From a Small Number of Customers The loss or consolidation of, network sharing among, or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 67.2% of our consolidated revenue was derived from Sprint Nextel, Cingular, Verizon Wireless and T Mobile, which represented 14.8%, 23.5%, 20.3% and 8.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, on a pro forma basis as if the Global Signal Merger was completed January 1, 2006, approximately 68.3% of our total combined revenues were derived from Sprint Nextel, Cingular, Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile, which represented 24.2%, 20.4%, 15.3%, and 8.4% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy, consolidation, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may materially decrease our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business. We cannot guarantee that the leases (including management service agreements) with our major wireless carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers will renew such agreements. Wireless carriers frequently enter into agreements with their competitors allowing them to utilize one anothers towers to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home providers services. In addition, wireless carriers have also entered into agreements allowing two or more carriers to share a single wireless network or jointly develop a tower portfolio in certain locations. Such agreements may be viewed by wireless carriers as a superior alternative to leasing space for their own antennas on our towers. The proliferation of these roaming, network sharing and joint development agreements may have a material adverse effect on us. In the ordinary course of business, we also sometimes experience disputes with customers, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in their respective agreements. Although, historically, we have resolved these disputes on commercially reasonable terms, future disputes could lead to increased tensions and damaged relationships with customers that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable customer could be damaged, which could lead to decreased revenues (including as a result of losing a customer) or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Wireless Carrier Consolidation Consolidation among customers may result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of sites and have a negative effect on revenues and cash flows. Consolidation among customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, which may result in a reduction of cell sites and impact revenues from our towers. In recent years, certain of our larger carrier customers have merged, including Cingular Wireless (now known as AT&T) with AT&T Wireless in October 2004 and Sprint with Nextel in August 2005. Recent regulatory developments have made consolidation in the wireless industry easier and more likely. For example, in February 2002, the FCC enabled the ownership by a single entity of interests in both cellular carriers in overlapping metropolitan cellular service areas. In January 2003, the FCC eliminated the spectrum aggregation cap in a geographic area in favor of a case by case review of spectrum transactions. It is possible that at least some customers may take advantage of this relaxation of spectrum and ownership limitations and consolidate their businesses. Any industry consolidation could decrease the demand for our towers, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues. 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Substantial Level of Indebtedness Our substantial level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business. We may also be limited in our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As a consequence of our indebtedness, we (1) are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (2) may choose to institute self imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. For example, the limits imposed by our indebtedness restrict, under certain circumstances, our and certain of our respective subsidiaries ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness, issuing preferred stock, engaging in various types of transactions, such as mergers and sales of assets, and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments and investments. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. The following chart sets forth certain important credit information and is presented on a U.S. GAAP basis as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, and after giving effect to the $600.0 million term loan entered into in January 2007 (2007 Term Loan) and the January 2007 Stock Purchase. (In thousands of dollars) Total indebtedness $ 5,945,534 Redeemable preferred stock 312,871 Stockholders equity 3,533,332 Debt and redeemable preferred stock to equity ratio 1.77 As a result of our substantial debt, demands on our cash resources will increase, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of our common stock. As a result of our substantial indebtedness: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments, including capital expenditures; we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry; and we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt or pay our obligations under our preferred stock. In addition, we may need to refinance some or all of our indebtedness and preferred stock on or before maturity. If we are unable to refinance our debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements in the future. Fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, and after giving effect to the 2007 Term Loan, approximately 89.9% of our outstanding indebtedness consists of long term fixed interest rate notes. In addition, there is no guarantee future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. Crown Castle International Corp. (CCIC) is a holding company with no business operations of its own. We conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. As of January 31, 2007, approximately 1.1% of our consolidated indebtedness, was held at the holding company level (another 10.1% of our consolidated indebtedness is unconditionally guaranteed by the holding company). Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness held at the holding company level is distributions relating to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the cash flows and net earnings generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt, equity offerings, sale of FiberTower or Modeo or certain asset sales. If our subsidiaries are unable to dividend cash to us when we need it, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations, including interest and principal payments, under our debt instruments. 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Economic and Wireless Telecommunications Industry Slowdown an economic or wireless telecommunications industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our towers and network services) and the business of our customers. In past years, the U.S. economy, including the wireless telecommunications industry, has experienced significant general slowdowns which negatively affected the factors described in these risk factors, influencing demand for tower space and network services. Similar slowdowns in the U.S. or Australia in the future may reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively impact the debt and equity markets, thereby causing carriers to delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3G and other wireless broadband services. Further, unforeseen events, including the war on terrorism, the threat of additional terrorist attacks, the political and economic uncertainties resulting therefrom may impose additional risks upon and adversely affect the wireless telecommunications industry and us. We believe that the prior economic slowdowns in the U.S., particularly in the wireless telecommunications industry, have harmed, and similar slowdowns in the U.S. or Australia may further harm, the financial condition or operations of wireless carriers, some of which, including customers of ours, have filed for bankruptcy protection. We Operate Our Business In a Competitive Industry and Some of Our Competitors Have Significantly More Resources or Less Debt Than We Do As a result of this competition, we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable lease rates on our towers. We face competition for site rental customers from various sources, including: other large independent tower owners; wireless carriers that own and operate their own towers and lease antenna space to other carriers; alternative facilities such as rooftops, broadcast towers and utility poles; new alternative deployment methods; site development companies that acquire antenna space on existing towers for wireless carriers and manage new tower construction; and local independent tower operators. Wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios generally are substantially larger (particularly given the impact of recently completed wireless carrier mergers) and have greater financial resources than we have. Competition for tenants on towers may adversely affect lease rates and revenues. New Technologies May Make Our Tower Leasing Service Less Desirable to Potential Tenants and Result in Decreasing Revenues Such new technologies may significantly reduce demand for tower leases and negatively impact the growth in our revenues. The development and deployment of signal combining technologies, which permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and, thereby, multiple customers, may reduce the need for our antenna space. In addition, other technologies, such as DAS, wireless mesh networks, mobile satellite systems and the delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites, may, in the future, serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on our towers had such technologies not existed. Any reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from multiple frequency antennas, satellite, DAS, mesh networks or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. New Technologies May Not Perform as Projected New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected. There can be no assurances that 3G, wireless data services or other new wireless technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner previously or presently projected by the wireless or broadcast industries. In 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements addition, demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. As a result, growth opportunities and demand for site rental as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent previously or presently anticipated. We Generally Lease or Sublease the Land Under Our Towers and May Not Be Able to Extend These Leases If we fail to protect our rights against persons claiming superior rights to the land on which our towers are located, our business may be adversely affected. Our real property interests relating to the land on which our towers are located consist primarily of leasehold and sub leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights of way. A loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of towers. Further, we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms. Post Merger, approximately 9.8% of our towers are on land where our property interests in such land have a final expiration date of less than 10 years. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse affect on us. Our ability to protect our rights against persons claiming superior rights in towers or real property depends on our ability to: recover under title insurance policies, the policy limits of which are likely to be less than the purchase price or economic value of a particular tower; in the absence of title insurance coverage, recover under title warranties given by tower sellers, which often terminate after the expiration of a specific period (typically in three years or less), contain various exceptions and are dependent on the general creditworthiness of the sellers making the title warranties; obtain estoppels from landlords in connection with the acquisitions, or in some cases the subsequent financing, of towers, which protect the collateral of our lenders and may provide a basis for defending post closing claims arising from pre closing events; recover from landlords under title covenants contained in lease agreements, which are dependent on the general creditworthiness of the landlords making the title covenants; obtain non disturbance agreements from mortgagees and superior lienholders of the land under our towers; and renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases, subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our towers are located or purchase the land on which such towers reside. We May Need Additional Financing, Which May Not Be Available, for Strategic Growth Opportunities If we are unable to raise capital in the future when needed, we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities. In the future, we may require significant capital expenditures for strategic growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, and after giving effect to the 2007 Term Loan and the January 2007 Stock Purchase, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $139.4 million and restricted cash of $137.5 million. In addition, we have $250.0 million of availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility (2007 Revolver). We may need additional sources of debt or equity capital in the future to fund future growth opportunities. Additional financing may be unavailable, may be prohibitively expensive, or may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Additional sales of equity securities would dilute our existing stockholders. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities. Modeos Business Has Certain Risk Factors Different from our Core Tower Business, Including an Unproven Business Model Modeos business may fail to operate successfully and produce results that are less than anticipated. Modeo is a new company with no operating history and may not be able to operate successfully. Modeo has an unproven business model and operates in the new, largely untested and rapidly evolving mobile media market. Modeo is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise. Modeo has had no revenues since inception. We expect Modeo to experience initial operating losses due to the costs and expenses associated with a start up operation. No assurance can be made that Modeo will ever generate positive cash flows or that losses recorded from Modeo will not increase in the future. 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Modeos planned business model assumptions include: wireless carriers and other potential retailers will want to offer Modeos service to their customers; a sufficient number of end users of wireless handsets and other mobile devices will subscribe to Modeos service; an adequate supply of wireless handsets and other mobile devices capable of operating on Modeos network will be timely available; and Modeo will be able to secure video and audio content licenses on favorable terms. If any of the assumptions is incorrect, Modeos proposed business will be harmed and may not become commercially available or survive. In addition, Modeos ability to achieve its strategic objectives will depend in large part upon the successful, timely and cost effective completion of a DVB H network beyond New York City. A variety of factors, uncertainties and contingencies could affect or prevent the successful, timely and cost effective build out of the planned Modeo network including: Modeos ability to wholesale its service to wireless carriers and other potential retailers; Modeos ability to obtain sufficient base station and broadcast equipment devices compatible with our spectrum license and DVB H; unforeseen delays, costs or impediments relating to the granting of state and municipal permits; Modeos ability to manage the build out effectively and cost efficiently; delays or disruptions resulting from the failure of third party suppliers, including equipment manufacturers, or contractors to meet their obligations in a timely and cost effective manner; and unsuccessful operation of, or the receipt of negative results or feedback relating to, our New York City network beta service. We continue to evaluate the potential options for funding the build out of the Modeo network beyond New York City, which include: non recourse debt secured by our 1670 1675 MHz spectrum license, equity investors in Modeo, joint venture proposals, proposals to sell a controlling interest in Modeo along with a combination of the above. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional third party financing on terms acceptable to us or that Modeo will be able to complete a DVB H network beyond New York City in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital from third party investors on acceptable terms in a timely manner or if Modeo is otherwise unable to meet its network development targets, then Modeo may not be able to implement its current business plan, and Modeos planned mobile media service may not become operationally active or commercially available. Many other companies, some with significantly greater resources than us, currently offer or plan to offer video and audio content to wireless handsets and other mobile devices. Although Modeos planned services are not yet commercially available, Modeo competes with these other offerings in bringing its service to commercial availability. If and when Modeos planned service becomes commercially available, Modeo will compete with these offerings in capturing potential subscribers and market share. Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless) and Verizon Wireless currently offer streaming video services over their networks under the brand names Sprint TV, MobiTV and Vcast, respectively. In addition, Qualcomm has announced that it is developing a multicast digital video service, marketed under the brand name MediaFLO. Verizon Wireless and AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless) have announced that they plan to offer their customers mobile video services over the MediaFLO network. Modeos planned service offering may also face competition from other companies offering podcasting and alternate methods of distributing video and audio to mobile devices. As a result of such competition, Modeo may not become viable or gain market share. There can be no assurances that wireless carriers will adopt a wholesale model, such as Modeos, to provide video and audio services to their subscribers. Modeos failure to operate successfully or accomplish its strategic 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements objectives could negatively impact Modeos ability to generate positive cash flow, could require us to dispose of all or part of Modeos business and assets, including the FCC spectrum license, or otherwise have an adverse effect on us. FiberTowers Business Has Certain Risk Factors Different from our Core Tower Business, Including an Unproven Business Model FiberTowers business may produce results that are less than anticipated, resulting in a write off of all or part of our investment in FiberTower. FiberTower commenced its principal operations in 2003 and has a limited operating history. FiberTower has an unproven business model and operates in the new and largely untested market for facilities based wireless backhaul services. As such, FiberTower is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise and may not be able to operate successfully. FiberTower has generated losses since inception. We anticipate that FiberTower will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future and may need additional funding to support the development of its business model. Although we believe that there will be demand for the backhaul solutions FiberTower provides to wireless carriers as the demand for additional wireless minutes of use increases, no assurances can be made that FiberTower will ever generate positive cash flows or that it will produce the results anticipated at the time of our investment. In addition, as a minority shareholder, we have a limited ability to affect FiberTowers operations. Additional risk factors relating to FiberTowers business can be found in FiberTowers filings with the SEC. Our investment in FiberTower is classified as an available for sale security, carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. The net unrealized gains or losses on our investment as a result of fluctuations in FiberTowers share price are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income unless such changes are deemed other than temporary. FiberTowers failure to operate successfully, gain market share or accomplish its strategic objectives could negatively impact FiberTowers per share price and could require us to write off all or a portion of our investment in FiberTower. As of January 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in FiberTower was $137.8 million (at $5.23 per FiberTower share). As of January 31, 2007, the unrealized investment gain included in accumulated other comprehensive income totaled $2.1 million or equivalent to $0.08 per FiberTower share. Although we currently have no plans to do so, should we choose to liquidate our investment in FiberTower, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to do so at a desirable value. In addition, our investment in FiberTower is subject to certain transfer restrictions that terminate in August 2007 or earlier in some cases. Laws and Regulations, Which May Change at Any Time and With Which We May Fail to Comply, Regulate Our Business If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business. A variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. We cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including state and local tax laws, will not adversely affect our business, increase delays or result in additional costs. These factors may have a material adverse effect on us. Shares Eligible For Future Sale Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of February 20, 2007, we had 282.8 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, we have reserved (1) 16.5 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans, (2) 1.2 million shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants, inclusive of 0.6 million shares of common stock as a result of the Global Signal Merger, (3) 5.9 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our 4% Convertible Senior Notes and (4) 8.6 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock. A small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, we have filed with the SEC a registration statement covering certain shares of common stock issued to the Global Signal Significant Stockholders in the Global Signal Merger. The Global 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Signal Significant Stockholders are subject to certain restrictions on their ability to sell or otherwise dispose of their shares of common stock for a period of up to 180 days after the closing of the Global Signal Merger. If any one of these stockholders, or any group of our stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline. The holders of our 6.25% convertible preferred stock (6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock) are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 6.25% per annum (approximately $19.9 million per annum) payable on a quarterly basis. We have the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock. At various times in the past, we have paid such dividends with shares of common stock, and we may elect to do so again in the future from time to time. The number of shares of common stock required to be issued to pay such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend is required to be paid. We Are Heavily Dependent on Our Senior Management If we lose members of our senior management, we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our business may be adversely affected. Our existing operations and continued future development depend to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of certain key individuals as employees, including our chief executive officer. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these or other key personnel. If we were to lose any of these individuals, we may not be able to find or integrate appropriate replacements on a timely basis, and we may be materially adversely affected. Variability in Demand For Network Services Business Reduces the Predictability of Our Results Our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand. The operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer term results for this activity. Network services revenues declined as a percentage of our total revenues during 2003 and 2004, reflecting our efforts to de emphasize this area of our business and increased competition, while such revenues increased modestly in 2005 and 2006. In the foreseeable future, network services revenues may decline as a percentage of our total revenues due to our focus on our core leasing business, increased competition or other factors. Emissions From Antennas on Our Towers or Wireless Devices May Create Health Risks If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs and revenues. The FCC and other government agencies impose requirements and other guidelines on their licensees relating to radio frequency emissions. The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us. Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services. If a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Anti Takeover Provisions in Our Certificate of Incorporation and Competition Laws May Have Effects That Conflict with the Interests of Our Stockholders Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by laws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to you. We have a number of anti takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock. Our anti takeover provisions include: a staggered Board of Directors; a shareholder rights agreement; the authority of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock; and advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings. Our by laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of a majority of the Board of Directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. Such provisions, as well as the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. In addition, domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. Our Operations Outside the U.S. Expose Us to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We may suffer losses as a result of changes in such currency exchange rates. After giving effect to the Global Signal Merger, we conduct business in Australia, Canada and United Kingdom, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 9.3% of our consolidated revenues originated outside the U.S., all of which were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, principally Australian dollars. We have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our non U.S. dollar operations, and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates. Approximately 1% of the revenue expected to be realized from the Global Signal business will be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars.

Properties Our principal corporate offices are located in Houston, Texas; Canonsburg, Pennsylvania; and Sydney, Australia. As a result of the Global Signal Merger, a lease for office space with an end date in 2010, relating to the Global Signal corporate office in Sarasota, Florida remains in effect. Location Property Interest Size (Sq. Ft.) Use Canonsburg, PA Owned 124,000 Corporate office Houston, TX Leased 18,586 Corporate office Sydney, Australia Leased 21,000 Corporate office In the U.S., we also lease and maintain three additional area offices (Area Offices) in addition to the Area Office operated from our Canonsburg, Pennsylvania office, located in (1) Charlotte, North Carolina, (2) Alpharetta, Georgia, and (3) Phoenix, Arizona. The principal responsibilities of these offices are to manage the leasing of tower space on a local basis, maintain the towers already located in the area and service our customers in the area. In addition, we lease additional, smaller district offices, which report to the Area Offices, in locations with high tower concentrations. We anticipate the expansion of certain Area Offices and district offices in 2007 as a result of the Global Signal Merger. In the CCUSA portfolio, Post Merger, 18.4% of the towers are guyed towers, 34.6% are self support lattice towers, 1.2% are rooftop installations and the remaining 45.5% are predominantly monopoles. Typical guyed towers are generally located on larger tracts of land of up to 7 acres, while non guyed towers are generally located on smaller tracts of land that typically range from approximately 1,600 to 22,000 square feet. These tracts of land support the towers, equipment shelters and, where applicable, guy wires to stabilize the structure. The actual square footage of the land relating to any particular tower depends on a number of things, including the topography of the site, the size of the area the landlord is willing to lease, the number of customers locating on the tower and the type of structure at the site. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, we own in fee or have permanent or long term easements in the land on which 3,926 of our CCUSA towers reside, or approximately 17.6% of our CCUSA portfolio, and we lease, sublease or license the land on which 17,611 of our CCUSA towers reside. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, CCUSA managed 737 towers owned by third parties where we had the right to market space on the tower or where we had sublease arrangements with the tower owner. In Australia, as of December 31, 2006, for 1,383 of our 1,387 CCAL towers site tenure of the land under our towers takes the form of a lease or license, and we own the remaining four sites in fee. Our ground leases, subleases and licenses generally have five or 10 year initial terms at CCUSA and 10 to 15 years at CCAL, and frequently contain one or more renewal options. For a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to expiration (including any renewal terms at our option) of the ground leases, subleases, or licenses for the CCUSA land which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Competition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Cash Obligations. In 2004, we began a program (Portfolio Extension Program) through which we seek to (1) renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases, subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our CCUSA towers are located or (2) purchase the land on which such towers reside. Global Signal had an ongoing initiative similar to the Portfolio Extension Program, which we expect to continue after the Global Signal Merger. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We Generally Lease or Sublease the Land Under Our Towers and May Not Be Able to Extend These Leases. On June 8, 2005, we issued $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of 2005 Tower Revenue Notes. On November 29, 2006, we issued $1.55 billion aggregate principal amount of 2006 Tower Revenue Notes as additional debt securities under the existing indenture pursuant to which the 2005 Tower Revenue Notes were issued in 2005. The 2005 Tower Revenue Notes and 2006 Tower Revenue Notes are effectively secured by 6,639 of our CCUSA towers and the cash flows from those towers. Governing instruments related to another 4,901 towers prevent liens from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of Verizon; however, distributions paid from the entities that own those towers will also service these notes. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Approximately 8,975 of the 10,749 towers acquired as a result of the Global Signal Merger and the cash flows from those towers are effectively pledged as security for debt of Global Signal consisting of the Commercial Mortgage Pass through Certificates, Series 2004 2 (2004 Mortgage Loan) and the Commercial Mortgage Pass through Certificates, Series 2006 1 (2006 Mortgage Loan). The 2004 Mortgage Loan and the 2006 Mortgage Loan remain outstanding as obligations of the Global Signal entities we acquired in the Global Signal Merger. Substantially all of our CCUSA towers can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the tower. Additionally, if so inclined as a result of customer demand, we could generally also tear down an existing tower and reconstruct another tower in its place with additional capacity, subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, the weighted average number of tenants per tower is approximately 2.50 on our 22,274 CCUSA towers, including rooftop installations. A summary of the number of existing tenants per tower as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, is as follows: Number of Tenants Number of Towers Greater than five 1,200 Five 1,177 Four 2,324 Three 3,862 Two 5,688 Less than two 8,023 22,274 Ite m 3. Legal Proceedings We are periodically involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business along with a shareholder derivative lawsuit as described below. Most of these proceedings, arising in the ordinary course of business, involve disputes with landlords, vendors, collection matters involving bankrupt customers, zoning and variance matters, condemnation or wrongful termination claims. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect any pending matters to have a material adverse effect on us. We know of five shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in 2006 in Texas state courts against various of our current and former directors and officers. The lawsuits all made allegations relating to our historic stock option practices and allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar matters. Among the forms of relief, the lawsuits seek alleged monetary damages sustained by CCIC. The plaintiffs have named CCIC as a nominal defendant and ostensibly bring the lawsuits on CCICs behalf. In December 2006 an order to consolidate the lawsuits into a single action and appoint lead plaintiffs counsel was entered. In February 2007, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated Petition styled In Re Crown Castle International Corp. Derivative Litigation, Cause No. 2006 49592; in the 234th Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas. Item 4. Submissions of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders On January 11, 2007 at a special meeting, the stockholders of the Company provided an affirmative vote to approve the issuance of common stock to stockholders of Global Signal pursuant to the Global Signal Merger. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements PART II Unless this Form 10 K/A indicates otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms, we, our, our company, the company or us as used in this Form 10 K/A refer to Crown Castle International Corp. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and exclude Global Signal.

Dividend Policy We have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock. It is our current policy to retain our cash provided by operating activities to finance the expansion of our operations, to reduce our debt or to purchase our own stock (either common or preferred). Future declaration and payment of cash dividends, if any, will be determined in light of the then current conditions, including our earnings, cash flow from operations, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by the terms of our debt instruments under certain circumstances and the terms of the certificates of designations in respect of our convertible preferred stock. The holders of our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 6.25% per annum, payable on a quarterly basis. We have the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock. The number of shares of common stock required to be issued to pay such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend is required to be paid. For the year ended December 31, 2004, dividends on our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 1,498,361 shares of common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, dividends on our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 631,700 and 0 shares of common stock, respectively, and approximately $9,939,000 and $19,877,000 in cash, respectively. On November 30, 2005, we exercised our redemption right for our $200 million 8 1/4% convertible preferred stock (8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock). On December 16, 2005, we redeemed the 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock. Prior to the redemption, the holders of our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 8 1/4% per annum, payable on a quarterly basis. Prior to redemption, we had the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock. The number of 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements shares required to pay such dividends was dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend was required to be paid. For the years ended December 31, 2004, dividends on our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 1,140,000 shares of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2005, dividends on our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 245,000 shares of common stock and approximately $12,375,000 in cash. Any shares of common stock issued to pay such dividends will continue to have a dilutive effect upon the shares of common stock otherwise outstanding, and declines in the fair market value of our common stock will increase the effective dilution. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, we purchased 845,000, 245,000 and 0 shares of common stock, respectively, from the dividend paying agent for a total of $12.2 million, $4.1 million and $ 0 in cash, respectively. We have also purchased shares of common stock on other occasions (see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources). We may choose to continue cash payments of the dividends in the future in order to avoid dilution caused by the issuance of common stock as dividends on our preferred stock. Issuance of Unregistered Securities Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities On May 10, 2006, we issued an aggregate of 38,196 unregistered shares of common stock to two holders of our outstanding warrants upon the cashless exercise of warrants to purchase 50,270 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.508 per share. We issued the shares in reliance upon exemptions from registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including Section 3(a)(9) and Section 4(2) therein.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below. CCUSA Overview The primary business of CCUSA is the leasing of antenna space on multiple tenant towers to a variety of customers under long term leases. Supporting our competitive position in the site rental business, we offer our customers certain network services relating to our towers, including antenna installations and other services. At December 31, 2006, Post Merger, CCUSA owned, leased or managed 22,274 towers, including rooftop installations. Although we own, lease or manage 252 towers located in Puerto Rico and Canada that are included in CCUSA, our towers are primarily located throughout the U.S. The U.S. towers are located predominantly in the northeast, southeast, midwest, southwest and Pacific coast regions of the U.S. Most of our towers were acquired 6 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements through transactions consummated within the past eight years, including through transactions with Global Signal, Bell Atlantic Mobile and GTE Wireless (both now part of Verizon Wireless), BellSouth Mobility and BellSouth DCS (both now part of AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless)) and Powertel (now a part of T Mobile). Through the Global Signal Merger, which closed on January 12, 2007, we acquired 10,749 towers which are located primarily in the U.S. Of the 10,749 towers Global Signal operated and which we now operate, 6,553 towers (Sprint Towers) are to be leased or operated for a period of 32 years (through May 2037) under master leases and subleases (Sprint Master Leases) with Sprint Corporation (a predecessor of Sprint Nextel) and certain subsidiaries of Sprint Corporation entered into in May 2005. Global Signal prepaid the rent owed under the Sprint Master Leases in May 2005. During the period commencing one year prior to the expiration of the Sprint Master Leases and ending 120 days prior to expiration, Post Merger we have the option to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Sprint Towers then leased for approximately $2.3 billion. Post Merger we are entitled to all revenue from the Sprint Towers during the term of the Sprint Master Leases, including amounts payable under existing leases with third parties. In addition, under the Sprint Master Leases, certain Sprint Corporation subsidiaries have agreed to sublease space on substantially all of the Sprint Towers for an initial period of 10 years. At the closing of the Global Signal Merger, the Sprint Master Leases remained effective as an asset and commitment of the Global Signal entities we acquired. Prior to the Global Signal Merger, our communication towers were primarily acquired in transactions beginning in 1998 through 2000, including the following transactions: Acquisition Transaction Closing Dates No. of CurrentCommunicationTowers Primary Tower Locations Bell Atlantic Mobile March 1999 2,020 Eastern, Southwestern U.S. GTE Wireless January September 2000 (a) 2,881 Eastern, Midwestern, Southwestern and Pacific Coast areas of the U.S. Bell South Mobility and Bell South DCS June 1999 December 2000(b) 3,046 Southeastern and Midwestern U.S. Powertel June 1999 675 Southeastern U.S. Trintel Communications Inc. August 2005 467 Midwestern U.S. Mountain Union Telecom, LLC July 2006 474 (c) Puerto Rico and Southern U.S. (a) The towers from GTE wireless were acquired in tranches from January 2000 through September 2000. (b) The towers from Bell South Mobility and Bell South DCS were acquired in tranches from June 1999 through December 2000. (c) The tower count is exclusive of 77 towers in various stages of development as of July 2006. We plan to continue to structurally enhance our existing towers and selectively build or acquire strategically located towers which meet certain economic criteria on a limited basis. To reduce risk and speculation, in connection with building towers, we generally look for towers with multiple tenant demand and obtain lease commitments from customers prior to building such towers. Further, the towers are constructed to accommodate multiple tenants in order to obviate the need for later structural enhancement, saving capital and time for our customers. Site Rental CCUSA rents antenna space on its towers to a variety of carriers operating cellular, PCS, ESMR, 3G, wireless data services, paging and other networks. The number of antennae that our towers can accommodate varies depending on the towers location, height and structural capacity. We generally receive monthly rental payments from customers, payable under site leases. The new leases at CCUSA recently entered into by us typically have original terms of seven to 10 years (with three or four optional renewal periods of five years each) and provide for annual price increases based upon a consumer price index, a fixed percentage or a combination thereof. The lease agreements with our customers relating to tower network 7 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements acquisitions generally have an original term of 10 years, with multiple renewal options, each typically ranging from five to 10 years. We have existing master lease agreements with most major wireless carriers, including Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile, which provide certain terms (including economic terms) that govern leases on our towers entered into by such parties during the term of their master lease agreements. The average monthly rental payment of a new tenant added to a tower varies among the different regions in the U.S. and the type of service being provided by the tenant, with broadband tenants (such as PCS) paying more than narrowband tenants (such as paging), primarily as a result of the physical size of the antenna installation. In addition, we also routinely receive rental payment increases in connection with lease amendments which authorize carriers to add additional antennas or other equipment to towers on which they already have equipment pursuant to pre existing lease agreements. Network Services We also provide network services, on a limited basis, primarily relating to our towers for our customers. Our service offering consists of antenna installations and subsequent augmentation, network design and site selection, site acquisition, site development and other services. Customers In both the CCUSA site rental and network services businesses, we work with a number of customers in a variety of businesses including cellular, PCS, ESMR, 3G, wireless data services and paging. We work extensively with large national wireless carriers such as Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile. For the year ended December 31, 2006, these four carriers, accounted for approximately 72.7% of CCUSAs revenues and 67.2% of our consolidated revenues, with Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile accounting for 16.0%, 25.4%, 22.0%, and 9.3%, respectively, of CCUSAs revenues and 14.8%, 23.5%, 20.3%, and 8.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, on a pro forma basis as if the Global Signal Merger was completed January 1, 2006, approximately 68.3% of our total combined revenues was derived from Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless), Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile, with such customers representing 24.2%, 20.4%, 15.3%, and 8.4% of our combined consolidated revenues, respectively. No other single customer of CCUSA accounted for more than 10.0% of our 2006 consolidated revenues. See Item 1A. Risk Factors A Substantial Portion of Our Revenues is Derived From a Small Number of Customers. Sales and Marketing The CCUSA sales organization markets our towers within the wireless telecommunications industry. We seek to become the preferred independent tower provider for our customers. We use public and proprietary databases to develop targeted marketing programs focused on carrier network build outs, modifications, site additions and network services. Information about carriers existing location of antenna space, leases, marketing strategies, capital spend plans, deployment status, and actual wireless carrier signal strength measurements taken in the field is analyzed to match specific towers in our portfolios with potential new site demand. In addition, we have developed patented property management tools and software which allow us to estimate site leasing demand with greater speed and accuracy. Through these and other tools we have developed, we seek to determine potential demand for our towers, allowing for proactive discussions with our carrier customers regarding these towers and the timing of their demand. A team of national account directors maintains our relationships with our largest customers. These directors work to develop new tower leasing opportunities, network services contracts and site management opportunities, as well as to ensure that customers tower needs are efficiently translated into new leases on our towers. Sales personnel in our area offices develop and maintain local relationships with carriers that are expanding their networks, entering new markets, bringing new technologies to market or requiring maintenance or add on business. We target numerous types of customers, including cellular, PCS, ESMR, 3G, wireless data, paging and government agencies. Our objective is to lease space on existing towers and pre sell capacity on our new towers prior to construction. 8 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In addition to our full time sales and marketing staff, a number of senior managers and officers spend a significant portion of their time on sales and marketing activities and call on existing and prospective customers. Competition CCUSA competes with other independent tower owners which also provide site rental and network services; wireless carriers which build, own and operate their own tower networks; broadcasters with respect to their broadcast towers; building owners that lease antenna space on rooftop sites; and other potential competitors, such as utilities and outdoor advertisers, some of which actively participate in the site rental industry. Wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we have. We believe that tower location, deployment speed, capacity, quality of service and price has been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a tower. Some of the larger independent tower companies with which CCUSA competes in the U.S. include American Tower Corporation, SBA Communications Corporation and Global Tower Partners. Significant additional site rental competition comes from the leasing of rooftops, utility structures and other alternative sites for antennas. Competitors in the network services business include site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right of way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors, and our customers internal staffs. We believe that carriers base their decisions on the outsourcing of network services on criteria such as a companys experience, track record, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We Operate Our Business In a Competitive Industry and Some of Our Competitors Have Significantly More Resources or Less Debt Than We Do. CCAL Our primary business in Australia is the leasing of antenna space on towers to our customers. CCAL, a joint venture which is owned 77.6% by us and 22.4% by Permanent Nominees (Aust) Ltd, acting on behalf of a group of professional and institutional investors led by Jump Capital Limited, is our principal Australian operating subsidiary. CCAL is the largest independent tower operator in Australia. As of December 31, 2006, CCAL had 1,387 towers, with a strategic presence in each of Australias major metropolitan areas, including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. For the year ended December 31, 2006, CCAL comprised 7.6% of our consolidated revenues. CCALs principal customers are Optus, Vodafone Australia, Hutchison and Telstra. For the year ended December 31, 2006, these four carriers accounted for approximately 94.4% of CCALs revenues, with Vodafone Australia and Optus accounting for 34.5% and 34.1%, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors A Substantial Portion of Our Revenues is Derived From a Small Number of Customers. The majority of CCAL towers were acquired from Optus and Vodafone Australia in 2000 and 2001, respectively. In connection with these transactions, Optus agreed to lease space on the former Optus towers for an initial term of 15 years, and Vodafone Australia agreed to lease space on the former Vodafone Australia towers for an initial rent free term of 10 years. In Australia, CCAL competes with wireless carriers, which own and operate their own tower networks; service companies that provide site maintenance and property management services; and other site owners, such as broadcasters and building owners. The two other significant tower owners in Australia are Broadcast Australia and Telstra. We believe that tower location, capacity, quality of service, deployment speed and price within a geographic market are the most significant competitive factors affecting the leasing of a site. Several 3G networks continue to be developed in Australia. Two metropolitan networks are being built by joint ventures between Hutchison and Telstra and between Optus and Vodafone Australia, respectively. In addition, 9 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Telstra has constructed the first phase of a new national 3G network, which is currently not shared with Hutchison, to replace one of its existing networks. The Telstra network was launched commercially in October 2006. Each of the 3G networks has already utilized a number of our towers in connection with its deployment, and we expect more of our towers will be utilized by each of the networks in 2007. In addition, Optus recently announced plans to provide nationwide 3G coverage with deployment commencing in 2007. Unwired Australia and Personal Broadband Australia also continued their deployment of broadband wireless networks (providing high speed internet services to consumers) in 2006, which are currently operating in key metropolitan markets. Emerging Businesses We have pursued and are currently pursuing other strategic opportunities, or adjacent businesses, which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to achieve acceptable risk adjusted returns or exhibit potential to complement our core tower rental business. Such emerging adjacent businesses currently consist of Modeo. Modeo was formed in 2004 to explore a potential offering of live digital television and audio broadcast and podcasting to mobile devices, such as wireless phones. Modeo plans to offer this service as a wholesale network provider, utilizing the spectrum under our 1670 1675 MHz U.S. nationwide spectrum license (having an initial term of 10 years), which we acquired in 2003 through a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction. Modeo broadcasts its service using the Digital Video Broadcast to Handheld (DVB H) standard, the open standard for the broadcast of digital television to mobile devices. Modeo has had no revenues since inception. During 2006, Modeo completed the development of a commercial grade mobile television DVB H network in New York City. In December 2006, Modeo launched a live, commercial quality mobile television beta service in New York City that includes live video content from leading network programmers as well as streaming audio content. Modeo plans to stage its New York beta activities in phases throughout the first and second quarters of 2007, which will include establishing a formal beta test group. After we have received and evaluated the feedback from these beta activities, we will review and evaluate our options for expanding the Modeo network beyond New York City. We continue to evaluate the potential options for funding the build out of the Modeo network beyond New York City, which include: non recourse debt secured by our 1670 1675 MHz spectrum license, equity investors in Modeo, joint venture proposals, proposals to sell a controlling interest in Modeo along with a combination of the above. Many other companies, some with significantly greater resources than us, offer or plan to offer video and audio content to wireless handsets and other mobile devices. Although Modeos planned services are not yet commercially available, Modeo competes with these other offerings in bringing its service to commercial availability. If and when Modeos planned service becomes commercially available, Modeo will compete with these offerings to capture potential subscribers and market share. In particular, Qualcomm has announced that it is currently developing a multicast digital video service, marketed under the brand name MediaFLO. Verizon Wireless and AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless) have announced that they plan to offer their customers mobile video services over the MediaFLO network. In addition, Modeo may face competition from other companies offering podcasting and alternate methods of distributing video and audio to handheld devices. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Modeos Business Has Certain Risk Factors Different from our Core Tower Business, Including an Unproven Business Model. Employees At February 20, 2007, we employed approximately 1,160 people worldwide, inclusive of approximately 210 people previously employed by Global Signal who are providing services only during the integration of the Global Signal business. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages, and management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory. Regulatory Matters To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international regulations. The summary below is based on regulations currently in effect, and such regulations are subject to review and modification by the applicable governmental authority from time to time. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Laws and Regulations, Which May Change at Any Time and With Which We May Fail to Comply, Regulate Our Business. 10 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements United States Federal Regulations Both the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulate towers used for wireless communications transmitters and receivers. Such regulations control the siting and marking of towers and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers, require the registration of tower facilities and the issuance of determinations confirming no hazard to air traffic. Wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used. In addition, the FCC and the FAA have developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified tower and antenna structures based upon the height and location, including proximity to airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing tower and antenna structures above certain heights are reviewed by the FAA to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to aviation, which determination may be conditioned upon compliance with lighting and marking requirements. The FCC requires its licensees to operate communications devices only on towers that comply with FAA rules and are registered with the FCC, if required by its regulations. Where tower lighting is required by FAA regulation, tower owners bear the responsibility of notifying the FAA of any tower lighting outage. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties. Local Regulations The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 to preserve state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the siting of communications towers. The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting actions by local authorities that discriminate between different service providers of wireless services or ban altogether the provision of wireless services. Additionally, the law prohibits state and local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radiofrequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Local regulations include city and other local ordinances (including subdivision and zoning ordinances), approvals for construction, modification and removal of towers, and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly, but typically require us to obtain approval from local officials prior to tower construction. Local zoning authorities may render decisions that prevent the construction or modification of towers or place conditions on such construction or modifications that are responsive to community residents concerns regarding the height, visibility and other characteristics of the towers. Other Regulations We hold, through certain of our subsidiaries, certain licenses for radio transmission facilities granted by the FCC, including licenses for common carrier microwave service, commercial and private mobile radio service, specialized mobile radio and paging service, which are subject to additional regulation by the FCC. Our FCC license relating to the 1670 to 1675 MHz spectrum band contains certain conditions related to the services that may be provided thereunder, the technical equipment used in connection therewith and the circumstances under which it may be renewed. We are required to obtain the FCCs approval prior to assigning or transferring control of any of our FCC licenses. Australia Federal Regulation Carrier licenses and nominated carrier declarations issued under the Australian Telecommunications Act 1997 authorize the use of network units for the supply of telecommunications services to the public. The definition of network units includes line links and base stations used for wireless telephony services but does not include tower infrastructure. Accordingly, CCAL as a tower owner and operator does not require a carrier license. Similarly, because CCAL does not own any transmitters or spectrum, it does not currently require any apparatus or spectrum licenses issued under the Australian Radiocommunications Act 1992. 11 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Carriers have a statutory obligation to provide other carriers with access to towers, and, if there is a dispute (including a pricing dispute), the matter may be referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for resolution. As a non carrier, CCAL is not subject to this regime, and our customers negotiate site access on a commercial basis. While the Australian Telecommunications Act 1997 grants certain exemptions from planning laws for the installation of low impact facilities, newly constructed towers are expressly excluded from the definition of low impact facilities. Accordingly, in connection with the construction of towers, CCAL is subject to state and local planning laws which vary on a site by site basis. Structural enhancements may be undertaken on behalf of a carrier without state and local planning approval under the general maintenance power under the Australian Telecommunications Act 1997, although these enhancements may be subject to state and local planning laws if CCAL is unable to obtain carrier co operation to use that legislative power. For a limited number of towers, CCAL is also required to install aircraft warning lighting in compliance with federal aviation regulations. In Australia, a carrier may arguably be able to utilize the maintenance power under the Australian Telecommunications Act of 1997 to remain as a tenant on a tower after the expiration of a site license or sublease; however, CCALs customer access agreements generally limit the ability of customers to do this, and, even if a carrier did utilize this power, the carrier would be required to pay for CCALs financial loss, which would roughly equal the tower rental that would have otherwise been payable. Local Regulations In Australia there are various local, state and territory laws and regulations which relate to, among other things, town planning and zoning restrictions, standards and approvals for the design, construction or alteration of a structure or facility, and environmental regulations. As in the U.S., these laws vary greatly, but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from governmental bodies prior to tower construction and to comply with environmental laws on an ongoing basis. Environmental Matters To date, we have not incurred any material fines or penalties or experienced any material adverse effects to our business as a result of any domestic or international environmental regulations or matters. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Laws and Regulations, Which May Change at Any Time and With Which We May Fail to Comply, Regulate Our Business and Emissions From Antennas on Our Towers or Wireless Devices May Create Health Risks. The construction of new towers in the U.S. may be subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of major federal actions. The FCC has promulgated regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act which require applicants to investigate the potential environmental impact of the proposed tower construction. Should the proposed tower construction present a significant environmental impact, the FCC must prepare an environmental impact statement, subject to public comment. If a proposed tower may have a significant impact on the environment, the FCCs approval of the construction could be significantly delayed. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission, and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non hazardous substances, materials and wastes. As an owner, lessee or operator of real property, we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on site or off site contamination relating to existing or historical operations, and we could also be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to such contamination. We are potentially subject to environmental and cleanup liabilities in the U.S. and Australia. As licensees and tower owners, we are also subject to regulations and guidelines that impose a variety of operational requirements relating to radio frequency emissions. As employers, we are subject to OSHA (and similar occupational health and safety legislation in Australia) and similar guidelines regarding employee protection from 12 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements radio frequency exposure. The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We have compliance programs and monitoring projects to help assure that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on us. Ite m 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investment in our securities. Global Signal Merger The Global Signal Merger may cause disruptions in our business, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The Global Signal Merger could cause disruptions in or otherwise negatively impact our business. Among other things: the business combination of Global Signal with us may disrupt our business relationships with our customers, who may delay or defer decisions about current and future agreements with us because of the merger; current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which might adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key managers and other employees; and the attention of management may be directed toward the integration of Global Signal with us and away from other business operations. Performance of Assets Acquired in the Global Signal Merger The assets acquired in the Global Signal Merger may not perform as expected, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In evaluating the anticipated benefits of a potential transaction with Global Signal, we performed due diligence on Global Signals tower portfolio and other assets to be acquired in the Global Signal Merger, which due diligence included, among other things, analyzing tower locations, visiting select towers, evaluating radio frequency information, and evaluating potential carrier customer demand. The results of this due diligence were used to support assumptions that were made by us in creating financial models to evaluate the potential future performance of Global Signals assets and the combined company. There can be no assurances that the towers and other assets of Global Signal will perform as expected by us based on our due diligence and provide us with the benefits that have been anticipated. A variety of factors could cause these assets not to provide such benefits, including, among other things: the inability to procure additional ground space at existing tower locations; local and state restrictions on the ability to modify such towers; and latent structural weaknesses associated with such towers and the related cost of repairing, reinforcing or upgrading them. If Global Signals assets fail to perform as expected or we fail to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of Global Signals assets for these or other reasons, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. 13 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Integration of Global Signal The integration of Global Signal is expected to result in substantial expenses and may present significant challenges. We may face significant challenges in combining Global Signals operations in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key Global Signal personnel. This integration will be complex and time consuming. The failure to successfully integrate Global Signals business and to manage the challenges presented by the integration process successfully, including the retention of key Global Signal personnel, may result in us and our stockholders not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the Global Signal Merger. Achieving the benefits of the Global Signal Merger will depend in part on the integration of Global Signals operations, wireless communications tower portfolio and personnel in a timely and efficient manner and our ability to realize the anticipated synergies from this integration. This integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons, including, among others, the size of Global Signals wireless communications tower portfolio and because Global Signals and our internal systems and processes were developed without regard to such integration. Successful integration of Global Signal also requires coordination of personnel, which may be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and differences in policies, procedures and operations between the companies and the different geographical locations of the companies and their assets. If the integration is not successful, we might not realize the expected benefits of the merger, which could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock after the merger. We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the Global Signal business into our policies, procedures, operations and systems. There are a large number of systems that must be integrated, including management information, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll and benefits, lease administration systems and regulatory compliance. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the Global Signal business may offset incremental transaction, merger related and restructuring costs over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all, and there are a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses. Our Business Depends on the Demand for Wireless Communications and Towers We may be adversely affected by any slowdown in such demand, including a slowdown attributable to wireless carrier consolidation or by the sharing of networks by wireless carriers. Demand for our towers depends on demand for antenna space from our customers, which, in turn, depends on the demand for wireless services. The willingness of our customers to utilize our infrastructure, or renew existing leases on our towers, will be affected by numerous factors, including: consumer demand for wireless services; availability and location of our towers and alternative towers; cost of capital, including interest rates; availability of capital to our customers; willingness to co locate equipment; local and state restrictions on the proliferation of towers; cost of building towers; technological changes affecting the number or type of communications sites needed to provide wireless communications services to a given geographic area; our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers service requirements; and tax policies. A slowdown in demand for a particular wireless segment may adversely affect the demand for our towers. Moreover, some wireless carriers operate with substantial indebtedness, and financial problems for our customers may result in accounts receivable going uncollected, the loss of a customer (and associated lease revenue) or a reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities. 14 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements A slowdown in the deployment of equipment for new wireless technologies, the consolidation of wireless carriers, the sharing of networks by wireless carriers or the increased use of alternative sites may also adversely affect the demand for our towers. In addition, advances in technology, such as the development of new antenna systems, new terrestrial deployment technologies and new satellite systems, may reduce the need for land based, or terrestrial, transmission networks or our towers. To some extent, almost all of the above factors have occurred in recent years with an adverse effect on our business, and such factors are likely to persist in the future. The occurrence of any of these factors may negatively impact our revenues, result in an impairment of our assets or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. A Substantial Portion of Our Revenues is Derived From a Small Number of Customers The loss or consolidation of, network sharing among, or financial instability of any of our limited number of customers may materially decrease revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 67.2% of our consolidated revenue was derived from Sprint Nextel, Cingular, Verizon Wireless and T Mobile, which represented 14.8%, 23.5%, 20.3% and 8.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2006, on a pro forma basis as if the Global Signal Merger was completed January 1, 2006, approximately 68.3% of our total combined revenues were derived from Sprint Nextel, Cingular, Verizon Wireless, and T Mobile, which represented 24.2%, 20.4%, 15.3%, and 8.4% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. The loss of any one of our large customers as a result of bankruptcy, consolidation, merger with other customers of ours or otherwise may materially decrease our revenues and have other adverse effects on our business. We cannot guarantee that the leases (including management service agreements) with our major wireless carriers will not be terminated or that these carriers will renew such agreements. Wireless carriers frequently enter into agreements with their competitors allowing them to utilize one anothers towers to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home providers services. In addition, wireless carriers have also entered into agreements allowing two or more carriers to share a single wireless network or jointly develop a tower portfolio in certain locations. Such agreements may be viewed by wireless carriers as a superior alternative to leasing space for their own antennas on our towers. The proliferation of these roaming, network sharing and joint development agreements may have a material adverse effect on us. In the ordinary course of business, we also sometimes experience disputes with customers, generally regarding the interpretation of terms in their respective agreements. Although, historically, we have resolved these disputes on commercially reasonable terms, future disputes could lead to increased tensions and damaged relationships with customers that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation, our relationship with the applicable customer could be damaged, which could lead to decreased revenues (including as a result of losing a customer) or increased costs, resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Wireless Carrier Consolidation Consolidation among customers may result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks which may result in a reduction of sites and have a negative effect on revenues and cash flows. Consolidation among customers will likely result in duplicate or overlapping parts of networks, which may result in a reduction of cell sites and impact revenues from our towers. In recent years, certain of our larger carrier customers have merged, including Cingular Wireless (now known as AT&T) with AT&T Wireless in October 2004 and Sprint with Nextel in August 2005. Recent regulatory developments have made consolidation in the wireless industry easier and more likely. For example, in February 2002, the FCC enabled the ownership by a single entity of interests in both cellular carriers in overlapping metropolitan cellular service areas. In January 2003, the FCC eliminated the spectrum aggregation cap in a geographic area in favor of a case by case review of spectrum transactions. It is possible that at least some customers may take advantage of this relaxation of spectrum and ownership limitations and consolidate their businesses. Any industry consolidation could decrease the demand for our towers, which in turn may result in a reduction in our revenues. 15 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Substantial Level of Indebtedness Our substantial level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business. We may also be limited in our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As a consequence of our indebtedness, we (1) are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and (2) may choose to institute self imposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates, our relative leverage and our strategic plans. For example, the limits imposed by our indebtedness restrict, under certain circumstances, our and certain of our respective subsidiaries ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness, issuing preferred stock, engaging in various types of transactions, such as mergers and sales of assets, and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments and investments. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, new tower development, mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities. The following chart sets forth certain important credit information and is presented on a U.S. GAAP basis as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, and after giving effect to the $600.0 million term loan entered into in January 2007 (2007 Term Loan) and the January 2007 Stock Purchase. (In thousands of dollars) Total indebtedness $ 5,945,534 Redeemable preferred stock 312,871 Stockholders equity 3,533,332 Debt and redeemable preferred stock to equity ratio 1.77 As a result of our substantial debt, demands on our cash resources will increase, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition and the market price of our common stock. As a result of our substantial indebtedness: we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements; we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments, including capital expenditures; we may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in the industry; and we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt or pay our obligations under our preferred stock. In addition, we may need to refinance some or all of our indebtedness and preferred stock on or before maturity. If we are unable to refinance our debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements in the future. Fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, and after giving effect to the 2007 Term Loan, approximately 89.9% of our outstanding indebtedness consists of long term fixed interest rate notes. In addition, there is no guarantee future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness. Crown Castle International Corp. (CCIC) is a holding company with no business operations of its own. We conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries. As of January 31, 2007, approximately 1.1% of our consolidated indebtedness, was held at the holding company level (another 10.1% of our consolidated indebtedness is unconditionally guaranteed by the holding company). Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness held at the holding company level is distributions relating to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the cash flows and net earnings generated by such subsidiaries or from proceeds of debt, equity offerings, sale of FiberTower or Modeo or certain asset sales. If our subsidiaries are unable to dividend cash to us when we need it, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations, including interest and principal payments, under our debt instruments. 16 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Economic and Wireless Telecommunications Industry Slowdown an economic or wireless telecommunications industry slowdown may materially and adversely affect our business (including reducing demand for our towers and network services) and the business of our customers. In past years, the U.S. economy, including the wireless telecommunications industry, has experienced significant general slowdowns which negatively affected the factors described in these risk factors, influencing demand for tower space and network services. Similar slowdowns in the U.S. or Australia in the future may reduce consumer demand for wireless services or negatively impact the debt and equity markets, thereby causing carriers to delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies, including 3G and other wireless broadband services. Further, unforeseen events, including the war on terrorism, the threat of additional terrorist attacks, the political and economic uncertainties resulting therefrom may impose additional risks upon and adversely affect the wireless telecommunications industry and us. We believe that the prior economic slowdowns in the U.S., particularly in the wireless telecommunications industry, have harmed, and similar slowdowns in the U.S. or Australia may further harm, the financial condition or operations of wireless carriers, some of which, including customers of ours, have filed for bankruptcy protection. We Operate Our Business In a Competitive Industry and Some of Our Competitors Have Significantly More Resources or Less Debt Than We Do As a result of this competition, we may find it more difficult to achieve favorable lease rates on our towers. We face competition for site rental customers from various sources, including: other large independent tower owners; wireless carriers that own and operate their own towers and lease antenna space to other carriers; alternative facilities such as rooftops, broadcast towers and utility poles; new alternative deployment methods; site development companies that acquire antenna space on existing towers for wireless carriers and manage new tower construction; and local independent tower operators. Wireless carriers that own and operate their own tower portfolios generally are substantially larger (particularly given the impact of recently completed wireless carrier mergers) and have greater financial resources than we have. Competition for tenants on towers may adversely affect lease rates and revenues. New Technologies May Make Our Tower Leasing Service Less Desirable to Potential Tenants and Result in Decreasing Revenues Such new technologies may significantly reduce demand for tower leases and negatively impact the growth in our revenues. The development and deployment of signal combining technologies, which permit one antenna to service multiple frequencies and, thereby, multiple customers, may reduce the need for our antenna space. In addition, other technologies, such as DAS, wireless mesh networks, mobile satellite systems and the delivery of video services by direct broadcast satellites, may, in the future, serve as substitutes for or alternatives to leasing that might otherwise be anticipated or expected on our towers had such technologies not existed. Any reduction in tower leasing demand resulting from multiple frequency antennas, satellite, DAS, mesh networks or other technologies may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us. New Technologies May Not Perform as Projected New wireless technologies may not deploy or be adopted by customers as rapidly or in the manner projected. There can be no assurances that 3G, wireless data services or other new wireless technologies will be introduced or deployed as rapidly or in the manner previously or presently projected by the wireless or broadcast industries. In 17 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements addition, demand and customer adoption rates for such new technologies may be lower or slower than anticipated for numerous reasons. As a result, growth opportunities and demand for site rental as a result of such technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent previously or presently anticipated. We Generally Lease or Sublease the Land Under Our Towers and May Not Be Able to Extend These Leases If we fail to protect our rights against persons claiming superior rights to the land on which our towers are located, our business may be adversely affected. Our real property interests relating to the land on which our towers are located consist primarily of leasehold and sub leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights of way. A loss of these interests may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of towers. Further, we may not be able to renew ground leases on commercially viable terms. Post Merger, approximately 9.8% of our towers are on land where our property interests in such land have a final expiration date of less than 10 years. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse affect on us. Our ability to protect our rights against persons claiming superior rights in towers or real property depends on our ability to: recover under title insurance policies, the policy limits of which are likely to be less than the purchase price or economic value of a particular tower; in the absence of title insurance coverage, recover under title warranties given by tower sellers, which often terminate after the expiration of a specific period (typically in three years or less), contain various exceptions and are dependent on the general creditworthiness of the sellers making the title warranties; obtain estoppels from landlords in connection with the acquisitions, or in some cases the subsequent financing, of towers, which protect the collateral of our lenders and may provide a basis for defending post closing claims arising from pre closing events; recover from landlords under title covenants contained in lease agreements, which are dependent on the general creditworthiness of the landlords making the title covenants; obtain non disturbance agreements from mortgagees and superior lienholders of the land under our towers; and renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases, subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our towers are located or purchase the land on which such towers reside. We May Need Additional Financing, Which May Not Be Available, for Strategic Growth Opportunities If we are unable to raise capital in the future when needed, we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities. In the future, we may require significant capital expenditures for strategic growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, and after giving effect to the 2007 Term Loan and the January 2007 Stock Purchase, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $139.4 million and restricted cash of $137.5 million. In addition, we have $250.0 million of availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility (2007 Revolver). We may need additional sources of debt or equity capital in the future to fund future growth opportunities. Additional financing may be unavailable, may be prohibitively expensive, or may be restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Additional sales of equity securities would dilute our existing stockholders. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund future growth opportunities. Modeos Business Has Certain Risk Factors Different from our Core Tower Business, Including an Unproven Business Model Modeos business may fail to operate successfully and produce results that are less than anticipated. Modeo is a new company with no operating history and may not be able to operate successfully. Modeo has an unproven business model and operates in the new, largely untested and rapidly evolving mobile media market. Modeo is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise. Modeo has had no revenues since inception. We expect Modeo to experience initial operating losses due to the costs and expenses associated with a start up operation. No assurance can be made that Modeo will ever generate positive cash flows or that losses recorded from Modeo will not increase in the future. 18 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Modeos planned business model assumptions include: wireless carriers and other potential retailers will want to offer Modeos service to their customers; a sufficient number of end users of wireless handsets and other mobile devices will subscribe to Modeos service; an adequate supply of wireless handsets and other mobile devices capable of operating on Modeos network will be timely available; and Modeo will be able to secure video and audio content licenses on favorable terms. If any of the assumptions is incorrect, Modeos proposed business will be harmed and may not become commercially available or survive. In addition, Modeos ability to achieve its strategic objectives will depend in large part upon the successful, timely and cost effective completion of a DVB H network beyond New York City. A variety of factors, uncertainties and contingencies could affect or prevent the successful, timely and cost effective build out of the planned Modeo network including: Modeos ability to wholesale its service to wireless carriers and other potential retailers; Modeos ability to obtain sufficient base station and broadcast equipment devices compatible with our spectrum license and DVB H; unforeseen delays, costs or impediments relating to the granting of state and municipal permits; Modeos ability to manage the build out effectively and cost efficiently; delays or disruptions resulting from the failure of third party suppliers, including equipment manufacturers, or contractors to meet their obligations in a timely and cost effective manner; and unsuccessful operation of, or the receipt of negative results or feedback relating to, our New York City network beta service. We continue to evaluate the potential options for funding the build out of the Modeo network beyond New York City, which include: non recourse debt secured by our 1670 1675 MHz spectrum license, equity investors in Modeo, joint venture proposals, proposals to sell a controlling interest in Modeo along with a combination of the above. There can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional third party financing on terms acceptable to us or that Modeo will be able to complete a DVB H network beyond New York City in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital from third party investors on acceptable terms in a timely manner or if Modeo is otherwise unable to meet its network development targets, then Modeo may not be able to implement its current business plan, and Modeos planned mobile media service may not become operationally active or commercially available. Many other companies, some with significantly greater resources than us, currently offer or plan to offer video and audio content to wireless handsets and other mobile devices. Although Modeos planned services are not yet commercially available, Modeo competes with these other offerings in bringing its service to commercial availability. If and when Modeos planned service becomes commercially available, Modeo will compete with these offerings in capturing potential subscribers and market share. Sprint Nextel, AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless) and Verizon Wireless currently offer streaming video services over their networks under the brand names Sprint TV, MobiTV and Vcast, respectively. In addition, Qualcomm has announced that it is developing a multicast digital video service, marketed under the brand name MediaFLO. Verizon Wireless and AT&T (formerly Cingular Wireless) have announced that they plan to offer their customers mobile video services over the MediaFLO network. Modeos planned service offering may also face competition from other companies offering podcasting and alternate methods of distributing video and audio to mobile devices. As a result of such competition, Modeo may not become viable or gain market share. There can be no assurances that wireless carriers will adopt a wholesale model, such as Modeos, to provide video and audio services to their subscribers. Modeos failure to operate successfully or accomplish its strategic 19 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements objectives could negatively impact Modeos ability to generate positive cash flow, could require us to dispose of all or part of Modeos business and assets, including the FCC spectrum license, or otherwise have an adverse effect on us. FiberTowers Business Has Certain Risk Factors Different from our Core Tower Business, Including an Unproven Business Model FiberTowers business may produce results that are less than anticipated, resulting in a write off of all or part of our investment in FiberTower. FiberTower commenced its principal operations in 2003 and has a limited operating history. FiberTower has an unproven business model and operates in the new and largely untested market for facilities based wireless backhaul services. As such, FiberTower is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise and may not be able to operate successfully. FiberTower has generated losses since inception. We anticipate that FiberTower will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future and may need additional funding to support the development of its business model. Although we believe that there will be demand for the backhaul solutions FiberTower provides to wireless carriers as the demand for additional wireless minutes of use increases, no assurances can be made that FiberTower will ever generate positive cash flows or that it will produce the results anticipated at the time of our investment. In addition, as a minority shareholder, we have a limited ability to affect FiberTowers operations. Additional risk factors relating to FiberTowers business can be found in FiberTowers filings with the SEC. Our investment in FiberTower is classified as an available for sale security, carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. The net unrealized gains or losses on our investment as a result of fluctuations in FiberTowers share price are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income unless such changes are deemed other than temporary. FiberTowers failure to operate successfully, gain market share or accomplish its strategic objectives could negatively impact FiberTowers per share price and could require us to write off all or a portion of our investment in FiberTower. As of January 31, 2007, the fair value of our investment in FiberTower was $137.8 million (at $5.23 per FiberTower share). As of January 31, 2007, the unrealized investment gain included in accumulated other comprehensive income totaled $2.1 million or equivalent to $0.08 per FiberTower share. Although we currently have no plans to do so, should we choose to liquidate our investment in FiberTower, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to do so at a desirable value. In addition, our investment in FiberTower is subject to certain transfer restrictions that terminate in August 2007 or earlier in some cases. Laws and Regulations, Which May Change at Any Time and With Which We May Fail to Comply, Regulate Our Business If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be fined or even lose our right to conduct some of our business. A variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations apply to our business. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or require us to assume indemnification obligations or breach contractual provisions. We cannot guarantee that existing or future laws or regulations, including state and local tax laws, will not adversely affect our business, increase delays or result in additional costs. These factors may have a material adverse effect on us. Shares Eligible For Future Sale Sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of February 20, 2007, we had 282.8 million shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, we have reserved (1) 16.5 million shares of common stock for future issuance under our various stock compensation plans, (2) 1.2 million shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants, inclusive of 0.6 million shares of common stock as a result of the Global Signal Merger, (3) 5.9 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our 4% Convertible Senior Notes and (4) 8.6 million shares of common stock for the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock. A small number of stockholders own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, we have filed with the SEC a registration statement covering certain shares of common stock issued to the Global Signal Significant Stockholders in the Global Signal Merger. The Global 20 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Signal Significant Stockholders are subject to certain restrictions on their ability to sell or otherwise dispose of their shares of common stock for a period of up to 180 days after the closing of the Global Signal Merger. If any one of these stockholders, or any group of our stockholders, sells a large quantity of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline. The holders of our 6.25% convertible preferred stock (6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock) are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 6.25% per annum (approximately $19.9 million per annum) payable on a quarterly basis. We have the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock. At various times in the past, we have paid such dividends with shares of common stock, and we may elect to do so again in the future from time to time. The number of shares of common stock required to be issued to pay such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend is required to be paid. We Are Heavily Dependent on Our Senior Management If we lose members of our senior management, we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our business may be adversely affected. Our existing operations and continued future development depend to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of certain key individuals as employees, including our chief executive officer. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these or other key personnel. If we were to lose any of these individuals, we may not be able to find or integrate appropriate replacements on a timely basis, and we may be materially adversely affected. Variability in Demand For Network Services Business Reduces the Predictability of Our Results Our network services business has historically experienced significant volatility in demand. The operating results of our network services business for any particular period may vary significantly and should not necessarily be considered indicative of longer term results for this activity. Network services revenues declined as a percentage of our total revenues during 2003 and 2004, reflecting our efforts to de emphasize this area of our business and increased competition, while such revenues increased modestly in 2005 and 2006. In the foreseeable future, network services revenues may decline as a percentage of our total revenues due to our focus on our core leasing business, increased competition or other factors. Emissions From Antennas on Our Towers or Wireless Devices May Create Health Risks If radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets or equipment on our towers are demonstrated to cause negative health effects, potential future claims could adversely affect our operations, costs and revenues. The FCC and other government agencies impose requirements and other guidelines on their licensees relating to radio frequency emissions. The potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years. We cannot guarantee that claims relating to radio frequency emissions will not arise in the future or that the results of such studies will not be adverse to us. Public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications may slow or diminish the growth of wireless companies, which may in turn slow or diminish our growth. In particular, negative public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks may slow or diminish the market acceptance of wireless communications services. If a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects were established, our operations, costs and revenues may be materially and adversely affected. We currently do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters. 21 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Anti Takeover Provisions in Our Certificate of Incorporation and Competition Laws May Have Effects That Conflict with the Interests of Our Stockholders Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by laws and operative agreements and domestic and international competition laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or for us to acquire control of a third party, even if such a change in control would be beneficial to you. We have a number of anti takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts and may reduce the market value of our common stock. Our anti takeover provisions include: a staggered Board of Directors; a shareholder rights agreement; the authority of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without approval of the holders of our common stock; and advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings. Our by laws permit special meetings of the stockholders to be called only upon the request of a majority of the Board of Directors, and deny stockholders the ability to call such meetings. Such provisions, as well as the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. In addition, domestic and international competition laws may prevent or discourage us from acquiring towers or tower networks in certain geographical areas or impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. Our Operations Outside the U.S. Expose Us to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We may suffer losses as a result of changes in such currency exchange rates. After giving effect to the Global Signal Merger, we conduct business in Australia, Canada and United Kingdom, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 9.3% of our consolidated revenues originated outside the U.S., all of which were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, principally Australian dollars. We have not historically engaged in significant hedging activities relating to our non U.S. dollar operations, and we may suffer future losses as a result of changes in currency exchange rates. Approximately 1% of the revenue expected to be realized from the Global Signal business will be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Available Information and Certifications We maintain an internet website at www.crowncastle.com. Our annual reports on Form 10 K, quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, and current reports on Form 8 K (and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are made available, free of charge, through the investor relations section of our internet website at http://investor.crowncastle.com/sec.cfm as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, our corporate governance guidelines, business practices and ethics policy and the charters of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee are available through the investor relations section of our internet website at http://www.crowncastle.com/investor/corpgoverence. asp, and such information is also available in print to any shareholder who requests it. We submitted the Chief Executive Officer certification required by Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Listed Company Manual, relating to compliance with the NYSEs corporate governance listing standards, to the NYSE on June 16, 2006 with no qualifications. We have included the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10 K.

Properties Our principal corporate offices are located in Houston, Texas; Canonsburg, Pennsylvania; and Sydney, Australia. As a result of the Global Signal Merger, a lease for office space with an end date in 2010, relating to the Global Signal corporate office in Sarasota, Florida remains in effect. Location Property Interest Size (Sq. Ft.) Use Canonsburg, PA Owned 124,000 Corporate office Houston, TX Leased 18,586 Corporate office Sydney, Australia Leased 21,000 Corporate office In the U.S., we also lease and maintain three additional area offices (Area Offices) in addition to the Area Office operated from our Canonsburg, Pennsylvania office, located in (1) Charlotte, North Carolina, (2) Alpharetta, Georgia, and (3) Phoenix, Arizona. The principal responsibilities of these offices are to manage the leasing of tower space on a local basis, maintain the towers already located in the area and service our customers in the area. In addition, we lease additional, smaller district offices, which report to the Area Offices, in locations with high tower concentrations. We anticipate the expansion of certain Area Offices and district offices in 2007 as a result of the Global Signal Merger. In the CCUSA portfolio, Post Merger, 18.4% of the towers are guyed towers, 34.6% are self support lattice towers, 1.2% are rooftop installations and the remaining 45.5% are predominantly monopoles. Typical guyed towers are generally located on larger tracts of land of up to 7 acres, while non guyed towers are generally located on smaller tracts of land that typically range from approximately 1,600 to 22,000 square feet. These tracts of land support the towers, equipment shelters and, where applicable, guy wires to stabilize the structure. The actual square footage of the land relating to any particular tower depends on a number of things, including the topography of the site, the size of the area the landlord is willing to lease, the number of customers locating on the tower and the type of structure at the site. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, we own in fee or have permanent or long term easements in the land on which 3,926 of our CCUSA towers reside, or approximately 17.6% of our CCUSA portfolio, and we lease, sublease or license the land on which 17,611 of our CCUSA towers reside. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, CCUSA managed 737 towers owned by third parties where we had the right to market space on the tower or where we had sublease arrangements with the tower owner. In Australia, as of December 31, 2006, for 1,383 of our 1,387 CCAL towers site tenure of the land under our towers takes the form of a lease or license, and we own the remaining four sites in fee. Our ground leases, subleases and licenses generally have five or 10 year initial terms at CCUSA and 10 to 15 years at CCAL, and frequently contain one or more renewal options. For a tabular presentation of the remaining terms to expiration (including any renewal terms at our option) of the ground leases, subleases, or licenses for the CCUSA land which we do not own and on which our towers are located as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Competition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Cash Obligations. In 2004, we began a program (Portfolio Extension Program) through which we seek to (1) renegotiate and extend the terms of the ground leases, subleases and licenses relating to the land on which our CCUSA towers are located or (2) purchase the land on which such towers reside. Global Signal had an ongoing initiative similar to the Portfolio Extension Program, which we expect to continue after the Global Signal Merger. See Item 1A. Risk Factors We Generally Lease or Sublease the Land Under Our Towers and May Not Be Able to Extend These Leases. On June 8, 2005, we issued $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of 2005 Tower Revenue Notes. On November 29, 2006, we issued $1.55 billion aggregate principal amount of 2006 Tower Revenue Notes as additional debt securities under the existing indenture pursuant to which the 2005 Tower Revenue Notes were issued in 2005. The 2005 Tower Revenue Notes and 2006 Tower Revenue Notes are effectively secured by 6,639 of our CCUSA towers and the cash flows from those towers. Governing instruments related to another 4,901 towers prevent liens from being granted on those towers without approval of a subsidiary of Verizon; however, distributions paid from the entities that own those towers will also service these notes. 23 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Approximately 8,975 of the 10,749 towers acquired as a result of the Global Signal Merger and the cash flows from those towers are effectively pledged as security for debt of Global Signal consisting of the Commercial Mortgage Pass through Certificates, Series 2004 2 (2004 Mortgage Loan) and the Commercial Mortgage Pass through Certificates, Series 2006 1 (2006 Mortgage Loan). The 2004 Mortgage Loan and the 2006 Mortgage Loan remain outstanding as obligations of the Global Signal entities we acquired in the Global Signal Merger. Substantially all of our CCUSA towers can accommodate another tenant either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the tower. Additionally, if so inclined as a result of customer demand, we could generally also tear down an existing tower and reconstruct another tower in its place with additional capacity, subject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, the weighted average number of tenants per tower is approximately 2.50 on our 22,274 CCUSA towers, including rooftop installations. A summary of the number of existing tenants per tower as of December 31, 2006, Post Merger, is as follows: Number of Tenants Number of Towers Greater than five 1,200 Five 1,177 Four 2,324 Three 3,862 Two 5,688 Less than two 8,023 22,274 Ite m 3. Legal Proceedings We are periodically involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business along with a shareholder derivative lawsuit as described below. Most of these proceedings, arising in the ordinary course of business, involve disputes with landlords, vendors, collection matters involving bankrupt customers, zoning and variance matters, condemnation or wrongful termination claims. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect any pending matters to have a material adverse effect on us. We know of five shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in 2006 in Texas state courts against various of our current and former directors and officers. The lawsuits all made allegations relating to our historic stock option practices and allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar matters. Among the forms of relief, the lawsuits seek alleged monetary damages sustained by CCIC. The plaintiffs have named CCIC as a nominal defendant and ostensibly bring the lawsuits on CCICs behalf. In December 2006 an order to consolidate the lawsuits into a single action and appoint lead plaintiffs counsel was entered. In February 2007, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated Petition styled In Re Crown Castle International Corp. Derivative Litigation, Cause No. 2006 49592; in the 234th Judicial District Court, Harris County, Texas. Item 4. Submissions of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders On January 11, 2007 at a special meeting, the stockholders of the Company provided an affirmative vote to approve the issuance of common stock to stockholders of Global Signal pursuant to the Global Signal Merger. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. 24 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements PART II Unless this Form 10 K/A indicates otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms, we, our, our company, the company or us as used in this Form 10 K/A refer to Crown Castle International Corp. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and exclude Global Signal.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Price Range of Common Stock Our common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the symbol CCI. The following table sets forth for the calendar periods indicated the high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as reported by NYSE. High Low 2005: First Quarter $ 17.52 $ 15.40 Second Quarter 20.75 15.71 Third Quarter 25.43 19.81 Fourth Quarter 29.20 23.47 2006: First Quarter $ 32.77 $ 26.41 Second Quarter 34.93 27.45 Third Quarter 35.83 32.23 Fourth Quarter 35.29 31.84 As of February 20, 2007, there were approximately 797 holders of record of our common stock. Dividend Policy We have never declared nor paid any cash dividends on our common stock. It is our current policy to retain our cash provided by operating activities to finance the expansion of our operations, to reduce our debt or to purchase our own stock (either common or preferred). Future declaration and payment of cash dividends, if any, will be determined in light of the then current conditions, including our earnings, cash flow from operations, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by the terms of our debt instruments under certain circumstances and the terms of the certificates of designations in respect of our convertible preferred stock. The holders of our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 6.25% per annum, payable on a quarterly basis. We have the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock. The number of shares of common stock required to be issued to pay such dividends is dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend is required to be paid. For the year ended December 31, 2004, dividends on our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 1,498,361 shares of common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006, dividends on our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 631,700 and 0 shares of common stock, respectively, and approximately $9,939,000 and $19,877,000 in cash, respectively. On November 30, 2005, we exercised our redemption right for our $200 million 8 1/4% convertible preferred stock (8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock). On December 16, 2005, we redeemed the 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock. Prior to the redemption, the holders of our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 8 1/4% per annum, payable on a quarterly basis. Prior to redemption, we had the option to pay the dividends on such series of preferred stock in cash or in shares of common stock. The number of 25 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements shares required to pay such dividends was dependent upon the current market value of our common stock at the time such dividend was required to be paid. For the years ended December 31, 2004, dividends on our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 1,140,000 shares of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2005, dividends on our 8 1/4% Convertible Preferred Stock were paid with 245,000 shares of common stock and approximately $12,375,000 in cash. Any shares of common stock issued to pay such dividends will continue to have a dilutive effect upon the shares of common stock otherwise outstanding, and declines in the fair market value of our common stock will increase the effective dilution. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, we purchased 845,000, 245,000 and 0 shares of common stock, respectively, from the dividend paying agent for a total of $12.2 million, $4.1 million and $ 0 in cash, respectively. We have also purchased shares of common stock on other occasions (see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources). We may choose to continue cash payments of the dividends in the future in order to avoid dilution caused by the issuance of common stock as dividends on our preferred stock. Issuance of Unregistered Securities Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities On May 10, 2006, we issued an aggregate of 38,196 unregistered shares of common stock to two holders of our outstanding warrants upon the cashless exercise of warrants to purchase 50,270 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.508 per share. We issued the shares in reliance upon exemptions from registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including Section 3(a)(9) and Section 4(2) therein. Equity Compensation Plans Certain information with respect to our equity compensation plans is set forth in Item 12 herein. Purchases of Equity Securities We made no purchases of equity securities during the fourth quarter of 2006.
