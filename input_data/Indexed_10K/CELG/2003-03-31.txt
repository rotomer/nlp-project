ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW We were organized in 1980 as a unit of Celanese Corporation, a chemical company. Our initial mandate was to apply biotechnology to the production of fine and specialty chemicals. Following the 1986 merger of Celanese Corporation with American Hoechst Corporation, we were spun off as an independent biopharmaceutical company. In July 1987, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock and commenced the research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. We discontinued the biotreatment operations in 1994 to focus on our targeted small molecule cancer and immunology compound development programs and our biocatalytic chiral chemistry program. Between 1990 and 1998, our revenue was generated primarily through the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development and, to a lesser degree, from agrochemical research and development contracts. However, as revenue from THALOMID(Reg. TM) sales, license agreements and milestone payments related to our cancer and immunology programs increased, sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus. Accordingly, on January 9, 1998, we completed the sale of our chiral intermediates business to Cambrex Corporation for $15.0 million. Terms of the sale provided for a payment to Celgene of $7.5 million at closing and future royalties on product sales not to exceed the net present value on the initial date of the sale of $7.5 million, with a guarantee of certain minimum payments to Celgene beginning in the third year following the close of the agreement. In July 1998, we received approval from the FDA to market THALOMID(Reg. TM) (thalidomide) for use in ENL, a side effect of leprosy, and, in late September 1998, we commenced sales of THALOMID(Reg. TM) in the United States. Sales have grown rapidly each year since the launch and, in 2002, we recorded net sales of THALOMID(Reg. TM) of $119.1 million. On February 16, 2000, we completed a follow on public offering to sell 10,350,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $33.67 per share, as adjusted for a three for one stock split effective April 2000. 8,802,000 shares were for our account and 1,548,000 were for the account of a selling shareholder pursuant to the conversion of $9,288,000 of the 9%, January 1999 convertible notes held by that shareholder. Our proceeds, net of offering expenses, were approximately $278.0 million. On April 19, 2000, we signed a license and development agreement with Novartis Pharma AG in which we granted to Novartis a license for d MPH, our chirally pure version of Ritalin(Reg. TM). The agreement provides for significant upfront and milestone payments based on achieving various regulatory approvals and royalties on the entire family of Ritalin(Reg. TM) products upon approval of d MPH by the FDA. We have retained the rights for the use of d MPH in oncology indications. We received approval from the FDA to market d MPH, or Focalin(TM), on November 14, 2001. On August 31, 2000, we completed a merger, accounted for as a pooling of interests, with Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease. On December 31, 2002, we completed a merger, accounted for under the purchase method, with Anthrogenesis Corp., a privately held biotherapeutics company pioneering the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue following the completion of a full term, successful pregnancy. We have sustained losses in each year since our inception as an independent biopharmaceutical company in 1986. In 2002, we had a net loss of $100.0 million, including one time charges primarily as a result of acquired in process R&D related to the Anthrogenesis acquisition and a patent litigation settlement. At December 31, 2002, we had an accumulated deficit of $322.4 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize THALOMID(Reg. TM), develop our other oncology and immunological disease programs, further develop and commercialize our stem cell recovery 36 efforts and advance our gene regulation and target discovery program. These expenditures are expected to be more than offset by increasing product sales, royalties, revenues from various research collaborations and license agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, and investment income. Subject to the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K under "Risk Factors", we believe there are significant market opportunities for the pharmaceutical products and processes under development by us. To address these and potential future opportunities in a timely and competitive manner, we intend to seek out drug discovery and development collaborations and licensing arrangements with third parties. We have entered into agreements covering the manufacture and distribution for us of certain compounds, such as THALOMID(Reg. TM) and Focalin(TM), and the development by us of processes for producing chirally pure crop protection agents for license to agrochemical manufacturers. The latter development activities are performed through Celgro Corporation, our wholly owned agrochemical subsidiary. We have established a commercial sales, marketing and customer service organization to sell and support our products, and as of March 1, 2003, we employ approximately 160 persons in this capacity. We intend to develop and market our own pharmaceuticals for indications with economically accessible patient populations in our disease franchises. For drugs with indications outside the oncology and immunological disease fields and for larger patient populations, we may partner with other pharmaceutical companies. We currently partner with other companies for the development and commercialization of our chirally pure pharmaceutical and agrochemical products. We expect these arrangements typically will include some combination of license fees, milestone payments, reimbursement of research and development expenses and royalty arrangements. We also may acquire products or companies to expand our product portfolio and to augment our development and commercialization resources. Future operating results will depend on many factors, including demand for our products, regulatory approvals of our products, the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products by us or competing companies, the timing of research and development milestones and our ability to control costs. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 Total revenue. Our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased 19% to $135.7 million compared with $114.2 million for the same period in 2001. Total revenue in 2002 consisted of product sales of $122.9 million, of which $119.1 million were THALOMID(Reg. TM) sales and $3.8 million were sales of Focalin(TM), which received FDA approval in November 2001, and research contract revenue of $12.8 million compared with product sales of $84.2 million, of which $82.0 million were THALOMID(Reg. TM) sales and $2.2 million were sales of Focalin(TM), research contract revenue of $28.1 million and related party revenue of $1.9 million in 2001. THALOMID(Reg. TM) sales continue to grow in oncology as more clinical data is presented either in publications or at oncology meetings. Research contract revenue and royalty income in 2002, which decreased from 2001, included approximately $4.9 million of amortization of an upfront payment related to an agreement with Novartis and $4.7 million in royalty income from Novartis on sales of their Ritalin(Reg. TM) family of products. There was no related party revenue in 2002 as the initial terms of both related party agreements expired in 2001 and such entities are no longer considered related parties. Our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased 35% to $114.2 million compared with $84.9 million for the same period in 2000. Total revenue in 2001 consisted of product sales of $84.2 million, of which $82.0 million were THALOMID(Reg. TM) sales and $2.2 million were sales of Focalin(TM), research contract revenue of $28.1 million and related party revenue of $1.9 million compared with product sales in 2000 of $62.7 million, all of which were THALOMID(Reg. TM) sales, research contract revenue of $15.9 million and related party revenue of $6.3 million in 2000. Research contract revenue in 2001, which increased from 2000, included approximately $10.4 million of amortization of upfront payments related to two separate agreements with Novartis and a milestone payment of $12.5 million from Novartis for receiving FDA approval to market Focalin(TM). Research contract revenue in 2000 consisted primarily of recognition of $4.6 million of the $10.0 million nonrefundable upfront license fee payment received in 37 connection with a collaborative agreement entered into with Novartis in April 2000, and a $5.0 million milestone payment related to the same agreement with Novartis. Related party revenue decreased in 2001 from 2000 as the initial terms of both related party agreements expired and such entities are no longer considered related parties. One of those agreements was extended and approximately $2.8 million was classified as research contract revenue in 2001. Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in 2002 increased approximately 27% to $17.3 million, or 14% of product sales, from approximately $13.6 million, or 16% of product sales, in 2001. This increase was primarily related to the significant increase in THALOMID(Reg. TM) sales. Additionally, expenses related to product royalties on THALOMID(Reg. TM) sales increased due to larger royalty percentages as higher sales thresholds were met. Cost of goods sold for 2002 relating to Focalin(TM) sales continued to be favorably impacted as manufacturing costs incurred prior to Focalins(TM) approval in November 2001 were expensed as research and development expenses. This favorability will continue until the quantity previously expensed is completely sold. Cost of goods sold in 2001 increased approximately 36% to $13.6 million, or 16% of product sales, from approximately $10.0 million, or 16% of product sales, in 2000, in line with the increase in product sales and therefore primarily volume related. Cost of goods sold for 2001 relating to Focalin(TM) sales was favorably impacted as manufacturing costs incurred prior to Focalins(TM) approval in November 2001 were expensed as research and development expenses. Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor fees, principally with contract research organizations to assist in our clinical development programs, clinical drug supplies for our clinical and preclinical programs as well as other consumable research supplies, and allocated facilities charges such as building rent and utilities. Research and development expenses in 2002 increased 25% to $84.9 million from $67.7 million in 2001. Approximately $49.1 million in 2002 was spent on THALOMID(Reg. TM) and its follow on compounds, the IMiDs(TM) and SelCIDs(TM), primarily for preclinical toxicology and phase I/II clinical trials, the initiation of our phase III clinical trials in multiple myeloma and metastatic melanoma and legal expenses related to patent filings. We spent approximately $35.8 million in our gene regulation, target discovery and agro chemical programs, primarily for internal headcount related expenses, laboratory supplies and product development costs. Research and development expenses in 2001 increased 20% to $67.7 million from $56.2 million in 2000. Approximately $33.1 million was spent on THALOMID(Reg. TM) and its follow on compounds, the IMiDs(TM) and SelCIDs(TM), primarily for preclinical toxicology and phase I/II clinical trials, regulatory expenses for preparation of a supplementary New Drug Application, or sNDA, for THALOMID(Reg. TM) in multiple myeloma and legal expenses related to patent filings. Approximately $2.8 million was spent for Focalin(TM), primarily for drug supply that was expensed prior to FDA approval. We spent approximately $31.8 million in our gene regulation, target discovery and agro chemical programs, primarily for internal headcount related expenses, laboratory supplies and product development costs. As a percent of total revenue, research and development expenses were approximately 63%, 59% and 66% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Reference the table on page 4 of Part I Business section for the status of specific compounds. In general, estimated time to completion within the various stages of clinical development are as follows: ESTIMATED COMPLETION CLINICAL PHASE PERIOD Phase I 1 2 years Phase II 2 3 years Phase III 2 3 years Due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects, the cost to complete such projects is not reasonably estimable. The data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent a projects advancement through the various stages of clinical development, which would significantly impact the costs incurred in bringing a project to completion. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling expenses consist of salaries and benefits for sales and marketing and customer service personnel, warehousing and distribution costs, and other commercial 38 expenses to support the sales force and the education and registration efforts underlying the S.T.E.P.S.(Reg. TM) program. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, outside services for legal, audit, tax and investor activities and allocations of facilities costs, principally for rent, utilities and property taxes. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20% in 2002 to $69.7 million from $58.0 million in 2001. The increased spending was primarily commercial expenses to support the commercialization of THALOMID(Reg. TM), with approximately a $4.9 million increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily related to the sales force expansion. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 25% in 2001 to $58.0 million from $46.4 million in 2000. Similar to 2002, the increased spending in 2001 was primarily commercial expenses to support the commercialization of THALOMID(Reg. TM), with approximately a $2.7 million increase in sales and marketing expenses primarily related to the sales force expansion and an increase of $2.5 million in customer service and warehousing and distribution, primarily related to bringing the previously out sourced customer service function in house and a rollout of an enhanced S.T.E.P.S.(Reg. TM) program. As a percent of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 51%, 51% and 55% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Litigation settlement and related agreements. On December 31, 2002, we entered into a series of agreements with EntreMed, Inc. and Childrens Medical Center Corporation to effectively terminate ongoing litigation relating to patents for thalidomide analogs and to grant an exclusive license to us for the rights to those patents. Under the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement, we paid to EntreMed $10,000,000 for all thalidomide analog patents and associated clinical data and records, and the termination of any litigation surrounding those patents. Under the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement, we acquired from EntreMed 3,350,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and warrants for an additional 7,000,000 common shares for $16,750,000. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, at our option, into an aggregate of 16,750,000 shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $1.00 per share provided, however, that the conversion price in effect from time to time shall be subject to certain adjustments. Dividends will accrue at 6% per annum on these preferred stock. We shall have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock could then be converted, and with respect to such vote, we shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of shares of Common Stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.50 per share, vest after six months from the date of grant and expire after seven years from the date of grant. The Company completed an assessment of the estimated realizable value of the investment. Considering the level of the Companys ownership interest in EntreMed, its history of operating losses and the fact that EntreMed is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in research and development activities with proposed products and research programs in the early stage of clinical development, and, based on such assessment, the entire amount of such Preferred Stock was written down. We also signed an exclusive license agreement with CMCC that terminated any existing thalidomide analog agreements between CMCC and EntreMed and directly granted us an exclusive worldwide license for the analog patents. We paid to CMCC $2,500,000 under this agreement with another $2,500,000 payable between 2004 and 2006, the present value relating to which aggregating $2,201,500 was charged to 2002 earnings. Additonally, we entered into a five year sponsored research agreement with CMCC whereby we have committed $300,000 per year in funding. Additional payments are possible under the agreement depending on the successful development and commercialization of thalidomide analogs. We recorded a charge to earnings for the cost of these agreements and related expenses of $32,211,500 in 2002 including the write down of the EntreMed Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and certain legal expenses incurred in connection with the settlement. Acquired in process research and development On December 31, 2002, we completed the acquisition of Anthrogenesis Corp. for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million (See Note 3). Anthrogenesis is an early stage biotherapeutics company delivering stem cell therapies produced from renewable human placental sources/materials. We acquired Anthrogenesis to realize the substantial therapeutic and commercial potential of placental stem cells through its commercial and developmental infrastructure. 39 The acquisition of Anthrogenesis was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. Approximately $55.7 million of the total purchase consideration of $60.0 million was allocated to IPR&D, which was charged to expense at the acquisition date. In 2003, we do not expect the acquisition of Anthrogenesis to significantly impact the overall level of research and development expenses, or materially change our current product sales mix. Merger related costs. We incurred one time costs of $6.7 million related to the merger with Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2000. These costs were primarily related to fees for financial advisors, accountants, lawyers and financial printers. Interest and other income and interest expense. Interest and other income increased approximately 11% in 2002 to $23.1 million from $20.9 million in 2001. The increase was primarily related to higher realized gains of approximately $5.0 million on sales of certain marketable securities offset by lower interest income on lower average cash balances and lower yields on our securities during 2002. Interest and other income increased approximately 19% in 2001 to $20.9 million from $17.6 million in 2000. The increase was primarily related to higher average cash balances and the recognition of a gain on the sale of certain marketable securities during 2001. Interest expense decreased 67% to approximately $27,000 in 2002 compared with approximately $83,000 in 2001. The decrease was primarily related to exercising the purchase options on the majority of our leased equipment during 2002. Interest expense decreased 96% to approximately $83,000 in 2001 compared with $2.1 million in 2000. The decrease was primarily related to an agreement with the convertible note holders to eliminate the interest requirements in exchange for the right to hedge the shares underlying the convertible notes. Loss from continuing operations. The loss from continuing operations increased significantly in 2002 to $101.0 million from $2.9 million in 2001. The increased loss resulted from the acquisition of Anthrogenesis, whereby we incurred a charge of $55.7 million for in process research and development costs, the litigation settlement and related agreements with EntreMed, Inc. and CMCC which resulted in a charge of $32.2 million, an increase of $32.8 million in other operating costs and expenses as explained above under "Cost of goods sold", "Research and development expenses" and "Selling, general and administrative expenses" and a decrease of $1.1 million in the net income tax benefit, partially offset by an increase in total revenue of $21.5 million as explained above under "Total revenues" and an increase in net interest and other income and expense of $2.2 million as explained above under "Interest and other income and expense". The loss from continuing operations decreased significantly in 2001, to $2.9 million from $17.0 million in 2000. The decreased loss resulted from an increase in total revenue of $29.3 million as explained above under "Total revenues" and an increase in net interest and other income and expense of $5.3 million as explained above under "Interest and other income and expense", partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses of $20.0 million as explained above under "Cost of goods sold", "Research and development expenses" and "Selling, general and administrative expenses." Gain on sale of chiral assets. We received royalty payments from Cambrex Corporation of approximately $1.0 million, $992,000 and $719,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, which represent additional portions of the purchase price paid by Cambrex for our chiral assets. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Since inception, we have financed our working capital requirements primarily through product sales, private and public sales of our debt and equity securities, income earned on the investment of proceeds from the sale of such securities and revenue from research contracts and license and milestone payments. Since our initial product launch in the third quarter of 1998, we have recorded net product sales totaling approximately $296.6 million through December 31, 2002. Our working capital at December 31, 2002 decreased approximately 18% to $251.8 million from $306.5 million in 2001. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to a lower combination of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher current liablilities. 40 Cash and cash equivalents increased to $85.5 million in 2002 from $47.1 million in 2001 while investments in marketable debt securities decreased to $175.7 million in 2002 from $262.9 million in 2001. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by approximately $48.8 million reflecting increased spending for both commercial and research and development activities and the litigation settlement and related agreements with EntreMed and CMCC, partially offset by the receipt of funds from revenue received from research contracts and collection of receivables from sales of THALOMID(Reg. TM). We expect that our rate of spending will increase as the result of research and product development spending, increased clinical trial costs, increased expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products currently in development, increased costs related to the commercialization of THALOMID(Reg. TM) and increased capital investments. On February 16, 2000, we completed a public offering of 10,350,000 shares of our common stock, as adjusted for a three for one stock split effective April 2000. Proceeds from the transaction, net of expenses, were approximately $278.0 million. These funds, combined with the increasing revenue from product sales and various research agreements and collaborations, are expected to provide sufficient capital for our operations for the foreseeable future. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our operating (facilities) leases. We lease a 44,500 square foot laboratory and office facility in Warren, New Jersey, under a lease with an unaffiliated party, which has a term ending in May 2007 with two five year renewal options, a 29,000 square foot facility which has a term ending in July 2010 with two five year renewal options, and an 11,400 square foot facility with a term ending in 2005. Monthly rental expenses for these facilities are approximately $74,000. We also lease an 18,000 square foot laboratory and office facility in North Brunswick, New Jersey, under a lease with an unaffiliated party that has a term ending in December 2009 with two five year renewal options. Monthly rental expenses for this facility are approximately $50,200. In December 2001, we entered into another lease to consolidate our San Diego operations into one building. The 78,200 square foot laboratory and office facility in San Diego, California was leased from an unaffiliated party and has a term ending in August 2012. Monthly rental expenses for this facility are approximately $172,000. The three leases for the 44,000 square feet of San Diego laboratory and office space recently vacated by us are coterminous and end in December 2003. Under the leases, we reimburse the landlord for taxes, insurance and operating costs associated with the properties and have an outstanding letter of credit for $150,000 in favor of the landlord that is fully collateralized by cash. Upon transferring our operations to the new facility, the 2003 lease obligations and remaining unamortized leasehold improvements for the vacated properties were taken as a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2002. Upon completion of the acquisition of Anthrogenesis on December 31, 2002, we assumed 2 separate leases in the existing facility for office and laboratory space in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey. The leases are for a combined space of approximately 15,000 square feet with a monthly rental expense of approximately $10,000. Both leases have original five year terms with one expiring in 2004 and one expiring in 2007 with a five year renewal option. In November of 2002, Anthrogenesis entered into a lease for an additional 11,000 square feet of laboratory space in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The lease has a five year term with a three year renewel option. Monthly rental expense for this facility is approximately $7,500. For a schedule of payments related to the operating leases, refer to the table included in footnote 17(a) to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants discuss their most "critical accounting policies" in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. The SEC indicated that a "critical accounting policy" is one which is both important to the portrayal of the 41 companys financial condition and results and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policy to be critical: Revenue Recognition. We have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies. These agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements. The agreements are for both early and late stage compounds and are focused on specific disease areas. For the early stage compounds, the agreements are relatively short term agreements that are renewable depending on the success of the compounds as they move through preclinical development. The agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments, milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events, and in some cases ongoing research funding. The agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives FDA marketing approval. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101") Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period. If the estimated service period is subsequently modified, the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis. Revenue from the achievement of research and development milestones, which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process, are recognized when and if the specific milestones are achieved. Continuation of certain contracts is dependent upon our achieving specific contractual milestones; however, none of the payments received to date are refundable regardless of the outcome of the project. Research funding is recorded in the period during which the expenses covered by the funding occurred. Acquired in process research and development ("IPR&D"). IPR&D represents that portion of the purchase price of the Anthrogenesis acquisition that relates to the research and development activities, which are yet to demonstrate their technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. The estimated fair value of these projects is determined by employment of a discounted cash flow model. The discount rates used take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of each of the purchased in process technology projects that were valued. The analysis included forecasted future cash flows that are expected to result from the progress made on the in process project prior to the purchase dates. Appropriate operating expenses are deducted from the total forecasted net revenues to establish a forecast of net returns on the completed portion of the in process technology. Finally, these net returns are discounted to a present value using discount rates that incorporate the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotech industry and the Company as well as product specific risks associated with the purchased in process research and development products. The product specific risk factors include the products phase of development, likelihood of success, manufacturing process capability, scientific rationale, pre clinical safety and efficacy data, target product profile, and development plan and takes into consideration an overall discount rate, which represents a risk premium to the Companys weighted average cost of capital for purchase valuation purposes. The forecast data in the analysis is based on internal product level forecast information maintained by management in the ordinary course of managing the business. The inputs used by management in analyzing IPR&D is based on assumptions, which management believes to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur. The valuations used to estimate IPR&D require us to use significant estimates and assumptions, that if changed, may result in a different valuation for IPR&D. Valuations for the Anthrogenesis acquisition was completed by an independent third party consulting firm in accordance with SEC guidelines. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 94 3, Liability Recognition for 42 Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. The provisions of this Statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its Obligations under guarantees issued. The Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. None of the provisions are expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. CERTIFICATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The certifications by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of this Annual Report on Form 10 K as required by Section 906 of the Sarbane Oxley Act of 2002 (18 U.S.C. Section 1350), have been submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission as additional correspondence accompanying this report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Risk Our holdings of financial instruments are comprised of commercial paper, U.S. government and corporate securities. These financial instruments may be classified as securities available for sale and carried at fair value or held to maturity and carried at amortized cost depending upon our intent. Securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and are intended to be used to meet our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses (which are deemed to be temporary) on available for sale securities, if any, are reported in a separate component of stockholders equity. The cost of all debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses, is included in interest and other income. We do not use financial derivatives for investment or trading purposes. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, all securities have been classified as available for sale. We have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities to maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions. Although our investments are subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment.
