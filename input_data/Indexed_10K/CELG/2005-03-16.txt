ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION We are a multi national integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases. Our lead product THALOMID(R) (thalidomide) is currently marketed for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL. This product is more widely used off label for treating multiple myeloma and other cancers. Over the past several years, THALOMID(R) net sales have grown rapidly. The sales growth of THALOMID(R) has enabled us to make substantial investments in research and development, which has resulted in a broad portfolio of drug candidates in our product pipeline. These include a pipeline of THALOMID(R) analogs known as IMiDsTM. REVLIMID(R), one of our clinical stage IMiDs, is now being tested in multiple cancer trials, including ongoing pivotal Phase III Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, trials in multiple myeloma, or MM, and Phase II trials in myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, MDS with 5q deletion chromosomal abnormalities and MM that have the potential to result in FDA approval in late 2005 or early 2006. Given REVLIMID(R)s safety and efficacy profile, its large sales potential and the cost efficiencies we can achieve from marketing REVLIMID(R) through our established sales force, we anticipate the approval and launch of REVLIMID(R), if it occurs, would result in increased revenue and earnings. We believe that the sales growth of THALOMID(R), the growth potential for REVLIMID(R), the depth of our product pipeline, and our strong balance sheet position, make us competitive within the biopharmaceuticals sector. RESTATEMENT Following a review in December 2004 of our accounting treatment for the convertible preferred shares and warrants we received in connection with the December 31, 2002 litigation settlement and related agreements with EntreMed, Inc. and the Childrens Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC, where in return for approximately $26.8 million in cash we acquired all related EntreMed thalidomide analog patents, terminated the litigation and received preferred shares convertible into 16,750,000 shares of EntreMed common stock and warrants to purchase 7,000,000 shares of EntreMed common stock, it was determined that an adjustment to our consolidated financial statements was required for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. For more information about the litigation settlement with EntreMed Inc. and related agreements see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2002, based on what we believed was the appropriate accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles, we wrote off the entire $26.8 million relating to the convertible 32 preferred shares, the warrants and the litigation settlement and did not recognize any gains or losses on the warrants during 2003. This accounting treatment was based on multiple reasons including: (1) EntreMeds financial condition and its continuing losses; (2) the fact that we included the warrants along with the convertible preferred shares investment in applying the equity method of accounting, under which we wrote off the entire investment in December 2002; and (3) our inability to place a reliable fair value on the warrants given the significant number of shares underlying the warrants and, in our opinion, the inability to convert the underlying shares into cash (even if the warrants were to be net share settled) without significantly affecting EntreMeds stock price. Upon further review of the warrant terms, as well as the accounting treatment prescribed under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", or SFAS 133, and related Derivative Implementation Group, or DIG, interpretations, we have concluded that the warrants should be accounted for as a derivative instrument and carried on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded through earnings. In addition we reviewed the impairment of the investment in the EntreMed preferred shares. We have concluded that the investment should not have been written down as of the date of the transaction. Accordingly we have restored the investment of $4.4 million as of December 31, 2002 and reduced the net loss by a like amount. Under the equity method of accounting, we have recorded our share of the EntreMed losses in 2003 until the investment is written down to zero in the third quarter of 2003. We have now restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. The cumulative effect of the restatement through December 31, 2003 is an increase in other assets of $21.7 million and a decrease in accumulated deficit of $21.7 million. Equity losses in associated companies of $4.4 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2003. Interest and other income increased by $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and litigation settlement and related agreements expense decreased by $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Previously reported diluted net earnings per share increased by $0.07 and $0.06 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The restatement did not have any impact on previously reported total revenues, reported net cash flows or the 2003 operating loss. The following is a summary of the impact of the restatement on (i) our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003 and (ii) our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. We have not presented a summary of the impact of the restatement on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for any of the above referenced years because there is no net impact for any such year. 33 PREVIOUSLY IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA REPORTED ADJUSTMENTS AS RESTATED YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003: Consolidated Statement of Operations: Interest and other income $ 21,795 $ 16,574 $ 38,369 Equity losses in associated companies 4,392 4,392 Income before income taxes 13,479 12,182 25,661 Income from continuing operations 12,761 12,182 24,943 Net income 13,511 12,182 25,693 Per share: Income from continuing operations per Basic 0.08 0.07 0.15 Income from continuing operations per Diluted 0.07 0.07 0.14 Net income Basic 0.08 0.08 0.16 Net income Diluted 0.08 0.07 0.15 Consolidated Balance Sheet: Other assets $ 32,506 $ 21,690 $ 54,196 Total assets 791,336 21,690 813,026 Accumulated deficit (308,856) 21,690 (287,166) Total stockholders equity 310,054 21,690 331,744 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002: Consolidated Statement of Operations: Litigation settlement and related agreements $ 32,212 $ 9,508 $ 22,704 Total expenses 259,875 (9,508) 250,367 Operating loss 124,129 (9,508) 114,621 Loss before income taxes (101,098) 9,508 (91,590) Loss from continuing operations (101,000) 9,508 (91,492) Net loss (100,000) 9,508 (90,492) Per share: Loss from continuing operations Basic (0.65) 0.05 (0.60) Loss from continuing operations Diluted (0.65) 0.05 (0.60) Net loss Basic (0.65) 0.06 (0.59) Net loss Diluted (0.65) 0.06 (0.59) Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements (unaudited) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of the restatement on the 2004 and 2003 quarterly information. In addition, certain prior year amounts in Notes 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 17, 19 and 20 to our consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the restatement adjustments described above. FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS Future operating results will depend on many factors, including demand for our products, regulatory approvals of our products, the timing and market acceptance of new products launched by us or competing companies, the timing of research and development milestones, challenges to our intellectual property and our ability to control costs. The most salient factors are, in the near term, competition with 34 THALOMID(R), including generic competition, and delays in the introduction of REVLIMID(R) and, in the longer term, failure to commercialize our early stage drug candidates. NEAR TERM COMPETITION WITH THALOMID(R): While we believe that THALOMID(R) will continue to be used as a treatment in multiple myeloma and that competing products will not eliminate its use, it is possible that competition could reduce THALOMID(R) sales in multiple myeloma. In addition, generic competition could reduce THALOMID(R) sales. However, we own intellectual property which includes, for example, numerous U.S. patents covering restrictive drug distribution systems for more safely delivering drugs, including our "System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety", or S.T.E.P.S.(R), distribution program, which all patients receiving thalidomide in the United States must follow and which are listed in the FDA Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluation, or Orange Book. These patents do not expire until the years 2018 2020. We also have exclusive rights to several issued patents covering the use of THALOMID(R) in oncology. Even if generic competition were able to enter the market, it is unlikely such products could do so before 2007 based on a number of factors, including the time needed to commercialize such a product and the fact that challenges to THALOMID(R) will require a generic competitor to make a patent certification of non infringement and or invalidity of our patents listed in the Orange Book pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which would then, in turn, entitle us up to a 30 month stay of market approval of that generic equivalent. By that time, we plan to have at least partially replaced THALOMID(R) sales with REVLIMID(R) sales. On October 22, 2004, we received an approvable letter from the FDA relating to our THALOMID(R) multiple myeloma supplemental new drug application, or sNDA. The FDA letter stated that sufficient support for an accelerated approval could be provided by the results of the completed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, or ECOG, study comparing thalidomide plus dexamethasone to dexamethasone alone in previously untreated multiple myeloma patients. The submission of this additional data and completion of required responses and its review by the FDA may result in an accelerated approval of THALOMID(R) as a treatment for multiple myeloma in the second half of 2005. DELAY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF REVLIMID(R): While we have made progress toward regulatory approval of REVLIMID(R) based on ongoing pivotal Phase III Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, trials for REVLIMID(R) in multiple myeloma, a delay in the introduction of REVLIMID(R) or its failure to demonstrate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, other factors such as the availability of FDA approved competing products for the treatment of MDS could impact the markets acceptance of REVLIMID(R). In addition, our ongoing open label Phase II trials in MDS and multiple myeloma have completed their targeted enrollment. While the submission of an NDA based on data from these trials could result in an earlier regulatory approval if the data were to be sufficiently compelling, it should be noted that the FDA does not often grant approvals based on Phase II open label data alone. FAILURE TO COMMERCIALIZE EARLY STAGE DRUG CANDIDATES: Our long term success and sustainability depends on our ability to advance our earlier stage drug candidates through development and to realize the commercial potential of our broad product pipeline. COMPANY BACKGROUND In 1986, we were spun off from Celanese Corporation and in July 1987 we completed an initial public offering of our common stock. Initially, our operations involved research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. In 1994, we discontinued the biotreatment operations to focus on our programs for developing small molecule compounds for cancer and immunology indications, and on our biocatalytic chiral chemistry program. 35 Between 1990 and 1998, our revenues were derived primarily from the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development. By 1998, sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus and, in January 1998 we sold the chiral intermediates business to Cambrex Corporation. Revenue from license agreements and milestone payments related to our cancer and immunology programs began to increase at this time. In July 1998, we received approval from the FDA to market THALOMID(R) for use in ENL, a complication of the treatment of leprosy, and, in September 1998 we commenced sales of THALOMID(R) in the United States. Sales of THALOMID(R) have grown significantly each year, and THALOMID(R) has become our lead product. In 2002, 2003 and 2004 we recorded net THALOMID(R) sales of $119.1 million, $223.7 million and $308.6 million, respectively. In February 2000, we completed a follow on public offering in which we raised proceeds, net of offering expenses, of approximately $278.0 million. In April 2000, we signed a licensing and development agreement with Novartis Pharma AG in which we granted to Novartis a license for FOCALIN(R), our chirally pure version of RITALIN(R). The agreement provided for significant upfront and milestone payments to us based on the achievement of various stages in the regulatory approval process. It also provided for Celgene to receive royalties on the entire family of RITALIN(R) products. Pursuant to the agreement we retained the rights to FOCALIN(R) in oncology indications. In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease. In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., a privately held biotherapeutics company developing processes for the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue following the completion of a successful full term pregnancy for use in stem cell transplantation, regenerative medicine and biomaterials for organ and wound repair. In March 2003, we entered into a three year supply and distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, to distribute, promote and sell ALKERAN(R), ormelphalan, a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. The agreement, which provides us with an FDA approved oncology product, requires that we purchase ALKERAN(R) from GSK and distribute the products in the United States under the Celgene label. In June 2003, we raised an additional $387.8 million, net of expenses, through the issuance of $400.0 million of five year unsecured convertible notes. In October 2004, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Penn T Limited, or Penn T, a worldwide supplier of THALOMID(R), from a consortium of private investors for a US dollar equivalency of approximately $117.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired and including working capital adjustments and total estimated transaction costs. Through manufacturing contracts purchased in this acquisition, we are now able to control manufacturing for THALOMID(R) worldwide and we also increased our participation in the potential sales growth of THALOMID(R) in key international markets. Following this acquisition, in December 2004 we revised the Pharmion product supply agreement acquired in the Penn T acquisition. Under the modified agreement, Pharmion paid us a one time payment of $77.0 million in return for a reduction in their total product supply purchase price from 28.0 percent of Pharmions thalidomide net sales, including cost of goods to 15.5 percent of net sales. The collaboration also entails Pharmion paying us an additional $8.0 million over the next three years to extend the two companies existing thalidomide research and development efforts and a one time payment of $3.0 million for granting Pharmion license rights to develop and market thalidomide in three additional Asian territories (Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan), as well as for eliminating termination rights held by Celgene tied to the regulatory approval of thalidomide in Europe in November 2006. In late 36 2004, we entered into an agreement providing manufacturers of isotretinoin (Acutane(R)) a non exclusive license to our System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety, or S.T.E.P.S., patent portfolio. The manufacturers of isotretinoin have licensed these patents with the intention of implementing a new pregnancy risk management system to safely deliver isotretinoin in potentially high risk patient populations. Until 2003, we had sustained losses in each year since our incorporation in 1986. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, we posted net income of $25.7 million and $52.8 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2004 we had an accumulated deficit of $234.4 million. Since our inception, we have financed our working capital requirements primarily through product sales; public and private sales of our equity securities and debt; income earned from investment of the proceeds of such securities sales; and revenues from research contracts and license payments. We expect to make substantial additional expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products. We expect that our rate of spending will accelerate as a result of increases in clinical trial costs, expenses associated with regulatory approval and expenses related to commercialization of products currently in development. However, we anticipate these expenditures to be more than offset by increased product sales, royalties, revenues from various research collaborations and license agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, and investment income. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002 TOTAL REVENUE: Total revenue and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, were as follows: % CHANGE 2003 2002 TO TO (IN THOUSANDS $) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 Net product sales: THALOMID(R) $308,577 $223,686 $119,060 38.0% 87.9% FOCALIN(R) 4,177 2,383 3,861 75.3% (38.3%) ALKERAN(R) 16,956 17,827 (4.9%) N/A Other 861 557 54.6% N/A Total net product sales $330,571 $244,453 $122,921 35.2% 98.9% Collaborative agreements and other revenue 20,012 15,174 8,115 31.9% 87.0% Royalty revenue 26,919 11,848 4,710 127.2% 151.5% Total revenue $377,502 $271,475 $135,746 39.1% 100.0% NET PRODUCT SALES: 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: THALOMID(R) net sales were higher in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to price increases implemented in the second half of 2003 and in the first nine months of 2004. The total number of prescriptions, which increased approximately 9.4% from the prior year period, was offset by lower average daily doses. FOCALIN(R) net sales were higher in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to the timing of shipments to Novartis for their commercial distribution. ALKERAN(R) net sales were lower in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to supply disruptions earlier in the year, which lead to inconsistent supplies of ALKERAN(R) IV and consequently inconsistent end market buying patterns. Other 37 net product sales consist of sales of dehydrated human amniotic membrane for use in ophthalmic applications, which are generated through our Stem Cell Therapies segment following the December 2002 acquisition of Anthrogenesis Corp. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002: THALOMID(R) net sales were higher in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to the combination of price increases and oncologists expanded use of the product as a treatment for various types of cancers, especially first line use in multiple myeloma. THALOMID(R) net sales in 2003 also benefited from the market introduction, during the first half of the year, of two new higher strength formulations, which had higher per unit sales prices. FOCALIN(R) net sales were lower in 2003, as compared to 2002, due to the timing of shipments to Novartis for their commercial distribution. The ALKERAN(R) supply and distribution agreement with GSK was executed in March 2003. Accordingly, sales for this product are reflected only in the 2003 period. Other net product sales consist of sales of dehydrated human amniotic membrane for use in ophthalmic applications, which are generated through our Stem Cell Therapies segment. COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE: Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources in 2004 included a $7.5 million payment received from Novartis related to their FOCALIN(R) XR NDA submission; approximately $7.5 million related to the Pharmion collaboration agreements, primarily thalidomide research and development funding and S.T.E.P.S. licensing fees; approximately $3.7 million of umbilical cord blood enrollment, collection and storage fees generated through our Stem Cell Therapies segment; $0.5 million from S.T.E.P.S. use licensing fees; and approximately $0.8 million from other miscellaneous research and development and licensing agreements. The 2003 period included approximately $6.0 million related to the agreement to terminate the GelclairTM co promotion agreement between OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Celgene; approximately $4.3 million of thalidomide research and development funding and S.T.E.P.S. licensing fees received in connection with the Pharmion collaboration agreements; approximately $1.3 million of reimbursements from Novartis for shipments of bulk raw material used in the formulation of FOCALIN(R) XR and utilized in clinical studies conducted by Novartis; approximately $2.9 million of umbilical cord blood enrollment, collection and storage fees generated through our Stem Cell Therapies segment; and $0.7 million from other miscellaneous research and development and licensing agreements. The 2002 period included approximately $4.9 million for amortization of an up front payment and a $1.0 million milestone payment received from Novartis Pharma AG in connection with the SERM license agreement; $1.2 million of licensing fees from Pharmion; and $1.0 million of other milestone and other miscellaneous payments. ROYALTY REVENUE: Royalty revenue reflects royalties received from Novartis on sales of their entire family of RITALIN(R) drugs. The increases in royalty revenue were due to increases in the royalty rate on both RITALIN(R) and RITALIN(R) LA as well as increases in RITALIN(R) LA sales by Novartis. COST OF GOODS SOLD: Cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS $) 2004 2003 2002 Cost of goods sold $ 59,726 $ 52,950 $ 20,867 Increase from prior year $ 6,776 $ 32,083 $ 1,885 Percentage increase from prior year 12.8% 153.7% 9.9% Percentage of net product sales 18.1% 21.7% 17.0% 38 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: Cost of goods sold increased in 2004 from 2003, primarily as a result of higher royalties on THALOMID(R), partially offset by lower ALKERAN(R) costs. As a percentage of net product sales, however, cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower ALKERAN(R) costs. Profit margins on THALOMID(R) remained flat, as the increase in cost of goods sold (resulting from higher royalties) were offset by higher net sales (which were due to price increases implemented in the second half of 2003 and in the first nine months of 2004). 2003 COMPARED TO 2002: Cost of goods sold increased in 2003 from 2002, primarily due to significant growth in THALOMID(R) sales volumes, higher royalties on THALOMID(R) product sales and the introduction of ALKERAN(R). Cost of goods sold also increased as a percentage of net product sales primarily because of the introduction of ALKERAN(R), which has a significantly higher cost structure than THALOMID(R). The increase in the percentage, however, was partially offset by higher gross profits on THALOMID(R) (due to price increases initiated during the year) and by lower sales of FOCALIN(R) (which also has a higher reported cost structure than THALOMID(R)). RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor fees (paid principally to contract research organizations to assist in our clinical development programs), costs of drug supplies for our clinical and preclinical programs, costs of other consumable research supplies, regulatory and quality expenditures and allocated facilities charges such as building rent and utilities. Research and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS $) 2004 2003 2002 Research and development expenses $ 160,852 $ 122,700 $ 84,924 Increase from prior year $ 38,152 $ 37,776 $ 17,271 Percentage increase from prior year 31.1% 44.5% 25.5% Percentage of total revenue 42.6% 45.2% 62.6% 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: Research and development expenses increased by $38.2 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to increased spending in various late stage regulatory programs. These included Phase II regulatory programs for REVLIMID(R) in MDS and MM, as well as ongoing REVLIMID(R) Phase III SPA trials in MM. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002: Research and development expenses increased in 2003 from 2002, primarily due to the initiation of several large studies related to our THALOMID(R) and REVLIMID(R) clinical programs in the second half of 2002. Research and development expenses in 2004 consisted of approximately $78.3 million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs; $33.4 million spent on other human pharmaceutical programs, including toxicology, analytical research and development, drug discovery, quality and regulatory affairs; $40.6 million spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and $8.6 million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs. These expenditures support multiple core programs, including THALOMID(R), REVLIMID(R), ACTIMID(TM), CC 11006, PDE4/TNF alpha inhibitors, other investigational compounds, such as kinase inhibitors, benzopyrans, ligase inhibitors and tubulin inhibitors, and placental and cord blood derived stem cell programs. In 2003, approximately $52.8 million was spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs; $29.2 million was spent on other human 39 pharmaceutical programs, including toxicology, analytical research and development, drug discovery, quality and regulatory affairs; $33.7 million was spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and $7.0 million was spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs. In 2002, approximately $27.4 million was spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs; $22.2 million was spent on other human pharmaceutical programs, including toxicology, analytical research and development, drug discovery, quality and regulatory affairs; $32.3 million was spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and $3.0 million was spent on agro chemical programs. For information about the commercial and development status and target diseases of our drug compounds, refer to the product overview table contained in Part I, Item I of this annual report. In general, the estimated times to completion within the various stages of clinical development are as follows: ESTIMATED COMPLETION CLINICAL PHASE TIME Phase I 1 2 years Phase II 2 3 years Phase III 2 3 years Due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in preclinical testing and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects, the cost to complete such projects is not reasonably estimable. The data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent a projects advancement through the various stages of clinical development, which would significantly impact the costs incurred in completing a project. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE: Selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for sales and marketing and customer service personnel and other commercial expenses to support our sales force. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, outside services for legal, audit, tax and investor activities and allocations of facilities costs, principally for rent, utilities and property taxes. Selling, general and administrative expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS $) 2004 2003 2002 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 114,196 $ 98,474 $ 66,172 Increase from prior year $ 15,722 $ 32,302 $ 13,621 Percentage increase from prior year 16.0% 48.8% 25.9% Percentage of total revenue 30.3% 36.3% 48.7% 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $15.7 million in 2004 from 2003, as a result of an increase of approximately $12.0 million in general administrative and medical affairs expenses primarily due to higher headcount related expenses and an increase of approximately $3.6 million in sales force expenses primarily due to the creation of a sales operations group. The sales operations group, 40 among other things, manages pricing and reimbursement, corporate accounts, customer service and government affairs, as well as sales fleet expenses. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002: Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2003 from 2002, primarily due to first time expenses of approximately $10.1 million related to our Stem Cell Therapies segment following the December 2002 acquisition of Anthrogenesis Corp.; an increase of approximately $12.0 million in commercial expenses related to the expansion of the sales and marketing organization and an increase in customer service staff; and an increase of approximately $10.0 million in general administrative and medical affairs expenses. LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AND RELATED AGREEMENTS: In December 2002, we entered into a series of agreements with EntreMed, Inc. and Childrens Medical Center Corporation, or CMCC, terminating ongoing litigation relating to patents for thalidomide analogs and directly granting to us an exclusive license issued by CMCC for the rights to those patents. Under the terms of an asset purchase agreement with EntreMed, we paid EntreMed $10.0 million for all thalidomide analog patents and associated clinical data and records, and the termination of any litigation surrounding those patents. Under the terms of a securities purchase agreement with EntreMed, we acquired from EntreMed 3,350,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase an additional 7,000,000 common shares for an aggregate cash consideration of approximately $16.8 million. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, at our option into an aggregate of 16,750,000 shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $1.00 per share provided, however, that the conversion price in effect from time to time shall be subject to certain adjustments. Dividends are payable prior and in preference to the declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution to the holders of common stock. We have the right to one vote for each share of Common Stock into which such share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock could then be converted and with respect to such vote we have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of shares of Common Stock. We completed an assessment of the estimated realizable value of the investment. After assessing the level of our ownership interest in EntreMed, its history of operating losses and the fact that EntreMed is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in research and development activities with proposed products and research programs in the early stage of clinical development, the entire amount of such Preferred Stock was written down. As restated, we ascribed a value of $11.6 million to the convertible preferred stock. We signed an exclusive license agreement with CMCC that terminated any existing thalidomide analog agreements between CMCC and EntreMed and directly granted to Celgene an exclusive worldwide license for the analog patents. We paid CMCC $2.5 million in December 2002 and $0.5 million in January 2004 under the agreement. Another $2.0 million is payable between 2005 and 2006. The present value of these payments totaled $4.7 million and was expensed in 2002. Additionally, we entered into a five year sponsored research agreement with CMCC whereby we have committed $0.3 million per year in funding. Additional payments are possible under the agreement depending on the successful development and commercialization of thalidomide analogs. Prior to the restatement, we recorded a charge to earnings for the cost of these agreements and related expenses of $32.2 million in 2002 including the write down of the EntreMed Convertible Preferred Stock and certain legal expenses incurred in connection with the settlement. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.50 per share, vest after six months from the date of grant and expire after seven years from the date of grant. The warrants also include a net settlement feature and as discussed in Note 2, it was subsequently determined that they should be accounted for as a derivative. We ascribed a value of $5.1 million to the warrants as of December 31, 2002, which represents their fair value at such date. 41 ACQUIRED IN PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: On December 31, 2002, we completed the acquisition of Anthrogenesis Corp., which now operates as Celgene Cellular Therapeutics, for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations, under which approximately $55.7 million was allocated to IPR&D and charged to expense at the acquisition date. For more information on the Anthrogenesis acquisition, refer to Notes 3 and 19 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME: Interest and other income decreased approximately 21.8% to $30.0 million in 2004 from $38.4 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to changes in the fair value of the EntreMed warrants. In 2004, we recorded unrealized losses of $1.9 million related to these warrants whereas, in 2003 we recorded unrealized gains of $16.6 million. This reduction was partially offset by higher returns on our cash and marketable securities portfolio (which was largely due to higher average balances of cash and marketable securities as a result of the issuance of $400 million of convertible notes, on June 3, 2003, as well as cash generated through operations) and foreign exchange gains. Interest and other income increased approximately 66.4% to $38.4 million in 2003 from $23.1 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains of $16.6 in the fair value of the EntreMed warrants partially offset by lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates in 2003. EQUITY IN LOSSES OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES: As restated (see further discussions contained in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Footnote 2 of our consolidated financial statements), during 2003 under the equity method of accounting we recorded $4.4 million for our share of the EntreMed losses. INTEREST EXPENSE: Interest expense in 2004 was approximately $9.6 million and includes twelve months of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400 million of convertible notes issued on June 3, 2003. Interest expense in 2003 was approximately $5.7 million and only includes seven months of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400 million of convertible notes issued on June 3, 2003. Interest expense in 2002 was immaterial. INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION): In 2004, we recorded an income tax provision of approximately $10.4 million, which reflects an effective underlying tax rate of 16.5%. Our rate rose in 2004 from 2003 primarily due to federal tax expense and decreases in the valuation allowance available to offset income tax expense. In 2003, our income tax provision was approximately $0.7 million and included income tax expense of $1.1 million for federal and state purposes, offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 million from the sale of certain state net operating loss carryforwards. In 2002, we recorded a net income tax benefit of approximately $0.1 million, which reflected income tax expense of $0.6 million for state purposes offset by a tax benefit of $0.7 million from the sale of certain state net operating loss carryforwards. INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS: Income (loss) from continuing operations and per common share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) 2004 2003 2002 As restated As restated Income (loss) from continuing Operations $ 52,756 $ 24,943 $ (91,492) Per common share amounts: Basic $ 0.32 $ 0.15 $ (0.60) Diluted $ 0.31 $ 0.14 $ (0.60) Weighted average number of shares of common stock utilized to calculate per common share amounts: Basic 163,869 161,774 154,674 Diluted 172,855 170,796 154,674 42 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: Income from continuing operations increased in 2004 from 2003 due to an increase in total revenue of approximately $106.0 million (attributable primarily to an increase in THALOMID(R) net sales) partly offset by higher operating expenses of approximately $60.7 million and a decrease in interest and other income, net of approximately $7.9 million (attributable to a $1.9 million decrease in fair value of EntreMed warrants versus a prior year increase of $16.6 million partly offset by an increase in interest income and foreign exchange gains and the inclusion in 2003 of equity losses of associated companies of $4.4 million). 2003 COMPARED TO 2002: In 2003, we recorded income from continuing operations for the first time since our inception in 1986. Income from continuing operations increased in 2003 from 2002 due to an increase in total revenues of approximately $135.8 million (attributable primarily to an increase in THALOMID(R) net sales and first time ALKERAN(R) sales that resulted from executing the ALKERAN(R) supply and distribution agreement with GSK in March of 2003) and a $9.7 million increase in interest and other income, net primarily due to a $16.6 million increase in the fair value of EntreMed warrants. Partially offsetting these increases were higher operating expenses of approximately $23.8 million and the inclusion in 2003 of equity losses of associated companies of $4.4 million. Impacting the 2003 to 2002 operating expenses comparison were aggregate one time costs of approximately $78.4 million incurred in the 2002 period ($55.7 million from the write off of acquired in process research and development related to the Anthrogenesis acquisition and $22.7 million associated with the litigation settlement and related agreements with EntreMed, Inc. and CMCC). GAIN ON SALE OF CHIRAL ASSETS: In January 1998, we completed the sale of our chiral intermediate business to Cambrex Corporation. Pursuant to the minimum royalty provisions of the agreement, we received approximately $0.8 million and $1.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. For more information on the disposition of the chiral intermediates business, refer to Note 3 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately $155.9 million in 2004 compared to $18.7 million in 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings, the receipt of $80.0 million in connection with the December 2004 THALOMID(R) development and commercialization collaboration with Pharmion and a decrease in net working capital levels. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased approximately $47.0 million from 2002. The increase in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to higher earnings and the inclusion of $22.7 million of spending in the 2002 period related to the litigation settlement and related agreements with EntreMed, Inc. and CMCC, partially offset by an increase in net working capital levels. Net cash used in investing activities was $92.6 million in 2004 compared to $443.6 million in 2003. Included in the 2004 activities were cash outflows of $109.9 million for the October 2004 acquisition of Penn T, $7.0 million for an investment made in Royalty Pharma Strategic Partners, LP, which is classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, and $36.0 million for capital expenditures. Partially offsetting these outflows were cash inflows of approximately $60.3 million from net marketable securities sales. Included in the 2003 activities were cash outflows of $421.2 million for net marketable securities purchases, $12.0 million for the purchase of a Pharmion Corporation senior convertible note and $11.2 million for capital expenditures. In 2002, approximately $63.3 million of net cash was provided by investing activities, which was due to cash inflows of approximately $93.1 million from net marketable securities sales, offset by cash outflows of $11.1 million for capital expenditures, $10.3 million related to the December 2002 acquisition of Anthrogenesis and $9.5 million for the value ascribed to the EntreMed convertible preferred shares and warrants received in connection with the December 31, 2002 litigation settlement and related agreements with EntreMed. The Company previously followed the common practice of classifying its investments in auction rate notes as cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet. It was determined that these instruments are not cash equivalents and therefore, the Company has made a reclassification to its 43 Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003 in order to conform to the current years presentation. The reclassification resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a corresponding increase in marketable securities available for sale as of December 31, 2003 of approximately $207.1 million. The reclassification resulted in a net decrease of $207.1 million in net cash provided by investing activities in 2003, which was comprised of the following components; an increase in the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $229.2 million and an increase in the purchase of marketable securities of approximately $436.3 million. The Company did not hold such securities in 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $16.0 million, $399.7 million and $3.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and included cash inflows from the exercise of common stock options and warrants of approximately $16.3 million, $12.0 million and $4.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in 2003 were cash inflows of $387.9 million from net proceeds of the issuance of our convertible notes on June 3, 2003. Currency rate changes negatively impacted our cash and cash equivalents balances by $4.4 million in 2004. At December 31, 2004, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $748.5 million, an increase of $81.6 million from December 31, 2003 levels and reflects the inclusion of 1,939,600 shares of Pharmion Corporation common stock, of which 1,150,511 shares were obtained in connection with the March 2004, conversion of the Pharmion Convertible Note and 789,089 shares were obtained in connection with the September 2004, exercise of Pharmion warrants. At December 31, 2004, the Pharmion common stock investment classified in marketable securities had an estimated fair value of $81.9 million. We expect increased research and product development costs, clinical trial costs, expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products and capital investments. However, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale, combined with expected net product sales and revenues from various research, collaboration and royalties agreements are expected to provide sufficient capital resources to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004: PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN MORE THAN (IN MILLIONS $) 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 3 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL Convertible Note Obligations $ $ $400.0 $ $400.0 Operating leases 3.6 6.7 5.6 6.3 22.2 ALKERAN(R) supply and distribution agreement 20.0 5.0 25.0 Employment agreements 2.6 0.7 3.3 Other contract commitments 5.8 7.5 4.4 17.7 $ 32.0 $ 19.9 $410.0 $ 6.3 $468.2 CONVERTIBLE NOTE OBLIGATIONS: In June 2003, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million of unsecured convertible notes to qualified institutional investors. The convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi annually commencing December 1, 2003. The convertible notes have a stock split adjusted conversion rate of $24.225 per share, which represented a 50% premium to our closing stock price of $16.15, after adjusting prices for the two for one stock split effected on October 22, 2004, on May 28, 2003. The debt issuance costs related to these convertible 44 notes, which totaled approximately $12.2 million, are classified under "Other Assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are being amortized over five years, assuming no conversion. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the noteholders can convert the notes at any time into 16,511,840 shares of common stock at the conversion price. In addition, the noteholders have the right to require us to redeem the notes in cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued interest, prior to maturity in the event of a change of control and certain other transactions defined as a "fundamental change" within the agreement. We have registered the notes and common stock issuable upon conversion with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and we are required to use reasonable best efforts to keep the related registration statement effective for the defined period. Pursuant to the indenture governing the notes, we may not merge or transfer substantially all assets, as defined, unless certain conditions are met. OPERATING (FACILITIES) LEASES: We lease an aggregate of 92,100 square feet of laboratory and office space in Warren, New Jersey, under various leases with unaffiliated parties, which have lease terms ending between June 2005 and July 2010 with renewal options ranging from either one or two additional five year terms. Annual rent for these facilities is approximately $1.0 million. We also are required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. We also lease an 18,000 square foot laboratory and office facility in North Brunswick, New Jersey, under a lease with an unaffiliated party that has a term ending in March 2009 with two five year renewal options. Annual rent for this facility is approximately $0.5 million. In November 2004, we purchased land and several buildings in Summit, New Jersey, which will enable us to consolidate four New Jersey locations into one corporate headquarters and provide the room to accommodate our anticipated growth. As a result, we are currently exploring available to reduce or eliminate the financial impact of existing lease commitments on redundant facilities. In connection with our acquisition of Anthrogenesis in December 2002, we assumed two separate leases in the same facility for office and laboratory space in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey and have subsequently entered into one additional lease for additional space in the same facility. The leases are for an aggregate 20,000 square feet with annual rent of approximately $0.2 million. We also are required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. The leases have terms ending between September 2007 and April 2009 with renewal options ranging from either one or two additional five year terms. In November of 2002, Anthrogenesis entered into a lease for an additional 11,000 square feet of laboratory space in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The lease has a five year term with a three year renewal option. Annual rent for this facility is approximately $0.1 million. We lease a 78,202 square foot laboratory and office facility in San Diego, California from an unaffiliated party, which has a term ending in August 2012 with one five year renewal option. Annual rent for this facility is approximately $1.9 million and is subject to specified annual rental increases. Under the lease, we also are required to reimburse the lessor for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. For a schedule of payments related to operating leases, refer to Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ALKERAN(R) PURCHASE COMMITMENTS: In March 2003, we entered into a three year supply and distribution agreement with GSK to distribute, promote and sell ALKERAN(R) (melphalan), a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. Under the terms of the agreement, we purchase ALKERAN tablets and ALKERAN for infusion from GSK and distribute the products in the United States under the Celgene label. The agreement requires that we purchase certain 45 minimum quantities each year for an initial three year term under a take or pay arrangement aggregating $56.6 million over such period and is automatically extended by successive one year periods, unless at least one year prior to the renewal date, either party advises the other party that it elects not to extend the agreement. At December 31, 2004, the remaining minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled $25.0 million. EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS: We have employment agreements with certain officers and employees. Employment contracts provide for base compensation and an annual target bonus based upon achievement of our performance measures and annual increases in base compensation reflecting annual reviews and related salary adjustment. The outstanding commitment for base compensation related to employment contracts as of December 31, 2004 was approximately $2.6 million for 2005 and $0.7 million for 2006 (excluding any change in control provisions). OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: We signed an exclusive license agreement with CMCC, terminating any existing thalidomide analog agreements between CMCC and EntreMed and directly granting to us an exclusive worldwide license by CMCC for the analog patents. Under the agreement, we are required to pay CMCC $2.0 million between 2005 and 2006, the present value of which was expensed in 2002. Additional payments are possible under the agreement depending on the successful development and commercialization of thalidomide analogs. On October 21, 2004, the Company, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, acquired all of the outstanding shares of Penn T Limited, or Penn T, a worldwide supplier of THALOMID(R), from a consortium of private investors. Penn T was subsequently renamed Celgene UK Manufacturing II, Limited, or CUK II. In connection with the acquisition, we and CUK II entered into a technical services agreement with Penn Pharmaceutical Services Limited, or PPSL, and Penn Pharmaceutical Holding Limited pursuant to which PPSL provides the services and facilities necessary for the manufacture of THALOMID(R) and other thalidomide formulations. The total cost over the five year minimum agreement period is approximately $11.0 million. In October 2003, we signed an agreement with Institute of Drug Technology Australia Limited, or IDT, for the manufacture of finished dosage form of THALOMID(R) capsules. The agreement requires minimum payments for THALOMID(R) capsules of $4.7 million for the three year term commencing with the FDAs approval of IDT as an alternate supplier. The agreement provides us with additional capacity and reduces our dependency on one manufacturer for the production of THALOMID(R). As of December 31, 2004, the FDA has not approved such alternate supplier. 2005 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK In our January 27, 2005 earnings release, we set forth our initial earnings estimate for the full year 2005. Although we believe that the January 27, 2005 estimate continues to reflect our current thinking, there can be no assurance that revenues or earnings will develop in the manner projected or if the analysis, on which the projection were based, were to be redone on the date hereof that there would be no change in the guidance. REVENUES: Our initial 2005 financial guidance anticipates total revenue in the range of $525 million, with THALOMID(R) revenues targeted in the range of $400 million. Our 2005 revenue forecast for the RITALIN(R) family of drugs remains at approximately $60 million, which includes a payment for the approval of FOCALIN(R) XR. Our initial financial guidance does not include REVLIMID(R) product sales, nor does it include expenses associated with the potential commercial launch of REVLIMID(R). As regulatory timelines become more certain we will update this guidance. 46 R&D EXPENSES: Research and development expenses are expected to increase to the $190 million range in 2005. Important components of the increased spending include (1) expansion of both United States and European regulatory programs directed toward hematological and malignant blood disorders, (2) spending for the investigation of agents in solid tumor clinical trials, and (3) the potential advancement of compounds in our discovery programs, including PDE4/TNF alpha inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, ligase inhibitors, benzopyrans and placental derived stem cells into our pre clinical and clinical development pipeline. SG&A EXPENSES: Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase to the $140 million range in 2005, which includes increased spending for the commercial support of THALOMID(R) and ALKERAN(R) and expand our commercial and manufacturing capabilities in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. This guidance excludes the potential costs of employees stock options. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123R, "Share Based Payment", or SFAS 123R, that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which employee services are received in exchange for either equity instruments of the company, liabilities that are based on the fair value of the companys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS No. 123R addresses all forms of share based payment awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", that was provided in Statement 123 as originally issued. Instead, under SFAS No. 123R companies are required to record compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions measured at fair value. This statement is effective for quarters ending after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement. Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 03 01, "The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments," or EITF 03 01, was issued in February 2004. EITF 03 01 stipulates disclosure requirements for investments with unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments. The provisions of EITF 03 01 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. We have complied with the disclosure provisions of EITF 03 01. In September 2004, the FASB staff issued two proposed FASB Staff Positions, or FSP: Proposed FSP EITF Issue 03 1 a, which provides guidance for the application of paragraph 16 of EITF Issue 03 1 to debt securities that are impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases, and Proposed FSP EITF Issue 03 1 b, which delays the effective date of Issue 03 1 for debt securities that are impaired because of interests rate and or sector spread increases. We are currently monitoring these developments to assess the potential impact on our financial position and results of operations. EITF Issue No. 03 6, "Participating Securities and the Two Class Method Under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share." In April 2004, the EITF issued Statement No. 03 6, "Participating Securities and the Two Class Method Under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share." EITF 03 6 addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share by a company that has issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to the right to participate in dividends when, and if, declared. The issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating earnings per share, clarifying the definition of a participating security and how to apply the two class method. EITF 03 6 was effective for fiscal periods beginning after March 31, 2004 and was required to be retroactively applied. We evaluated the terms of our convertible notes and 47 debentures and determined that none of these instruments qualified as participating securities under the provisions of EITF 03 6. As a result, the adoption of EITF 03 6 had no impact on the Company. EITF Issue No. 02 14, "Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock," or EITF 02 14, is effective in the fourth quarter of 2004. EITF 02 14 states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in substance common stock. EITF 02 14 also provides characteristics to be evaluated in determining whether an investment in other than common stock is in substance substantially similar to an investments in that entitys common stock and thus, accounted for under the equity method. For investments that are not common stock or in substance common stock, but were accounted for under the equity method, EITF 02 14 requires discontinued use of the equity method of accounting prospectively for reporting periods beginning after September 15, 2004. Previously recognized equity method earnings and losses should not be reserved. Based on the above guidance, the Company concluded that is EntreMed preferred stock investments, which had previously been written down to zero under the equity method of accounting, was not in substance common stock as defined in EITF 02 14 and therefore, discontinued use of the equity method of accounting beginning on October 1, 2004. Prospectively, the Company will account for such investment under the cost method since the preferred stock is not publicly traded. This change does not impact the carrying value of the EntreMed preferred stock investment and accordingly, did not have an impact on the Conpanys consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results of operation and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical: REVENUE RECOGNITION ON COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS: We have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies. These agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements. The agreements are for both early and late stage compounds and are focused on specific disease areas. For the early stage compounds, the agreements are relatively short term agreements that are renewable depending on the success of the compounds as they move through preclinical development. The agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments, milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events, and in some cases ongoing research funding. The agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives FDA marketing approval. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, or SAB 104, "REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS," upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period. If the estimated service period is subsequently modified, the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis. Continuation of certain contracts is dependent upon our achieving specific contractual milestones; however, none of the payments received to date are refundable regardless of the outcome of the project. Revenue under research contracts is recorded as earned under the contracts, as services are provided. SAB No. 104 updates the guidance in SAB No. 101 and requires companies to identify separate units of accounting based on the consensus reached on Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00 21, "REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES", or EITF 00 21. EITF 00 21 provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if this division is required, how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting. EITF 00 21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in quarters beginning after June 15, 2003. If the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the EITFs separation criteria, the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit. If the arrangement is a single unit of accounting, the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement. Prior to the adoption of EITF 00 21, revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones, which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process, were recognized when and if the milestones were achieved. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, MEDICAID REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS: We record an allowance for sales returns based on the actual returns history for consumed lots and the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned. We record Medicaid rebate accruals based on historical payment data and estimates of Medicaid beneficiary utilization. We record chargeback accruals based on actual sales to customers who are covered under federally qualified programs. 48 DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE: We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: The recorded liability for long term incentive plans was $3.9 million as of December 31, 2004. Plan payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the participants salary for the 2005 Plan and 0% to 150% of the participants salary for the 2006 Plan and the maximum potential payouts are $6.1 million and $4.9 million for the 2005 and 2006 Plans, respectively. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award, or, if higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS: The Penn T and Anthrogenesis acquisitions completed in October 2004 and December 2002, respectively, have been accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," which requires the use of the purchase method. Under SFAS 141, the purchase price is allocated to the assets received and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The initial purchase price allocations may be adjusted within one year of the purchase date for changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The resulting goodwill, which represents the excess of costs of an acquired entity over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and intangible assets are accounted for under SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings. We have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions. Although investments may be subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment. At December 31, 2004, our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale, warrants to purchase up to 7,000,000 shares of EntreMed common stock and unsecured convertible notes issued by the Company. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: At December 31, 2004, our marketable securities available for sale consisted of U.S. government agency mortgage obligations, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate debt securities and 1,939,600 shares of Pharmion common stock. Marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value, are held for an indefinite period of time and are intended to be used to meet our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax. The cost of all debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses, is included in interest and other income. 49 As of December 31, 2004, the principal amounts, fair values and related weighted average interest rates of the Companys investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows: DURATION FIXED RATE SECURITIES VARIABLE 0 TO 1 1 TO 3 3 TO 5 5 TO 7 RATE (IN THOUSANDS $) YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS SECURITIES TOTAL Principal amount $287,443 $108,996 $ 30,264 $ 83,425 $ 20,513 $530,641 Fair value $288,542 $112,424 $ 31,895 $ 80,862 $ 17,717 $531,440 Average interest rate 2.98% 4.33% 4.92% 5.81% 5.88% 3.93% PHARMION COMMON STOCK: In March 2004, we converted our $12.0 million Pharmion Senior Convertible Note investment, which had accrued interest of approximately $0.7 million, into 1,150,511 shares of Pharmion common stock. Additionally, in September 2004, we exercised a total of 789,089 warrants to purchase shares of Pharmion common stock, which we had received in connection with previous transactions with Pharmion Corporation, (i.e., the November 2001 license agreement and the April 2003 securities purchase agreement). As a result of these transactions, at December 31, 2004, we held a total of 1,939,600 shares of Pharmion Corporation common stock, which had an estimated fair value of approximately $81.9 million (based on the closing price reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, or NASDAQ system, and, which exceeded the cost by approximately $61.7 million. The amount by which the fair value exceeded the cost (i.e., the unrealized gain) was included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Pharmion common stock investment is subject to market price volatility and any increase or decrease in Pharmions common stock quoted market price will have a similar percentage increase or decrease in the fair value of our investment. ENTREMED WARRANTS: In connection with the December 31, 2002, litigation settlement and related agreements with EntreMed Corporation and CMCC, we received warrants to purchase 7,000,000 shares of EntreMed common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.50 per share and expire seven years from the date of grant. Based on EntreMeds closing stock price on December 31, 2004, of $3.24, the intrinsic value of the warrants is approximately $12.2 million and the fair value using a Black Scholes options pricing model is estimated to be approximately $19.8 million. Since the warrants give us the right, but not an obligation, to purchase the shares of EntreMed common stock, the warrants can never result in a cumulative negative charge to earnings. CONVERTIBLE DEBT: In June 2003, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured convertible notes. The convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi annually. The convertible notes can be converted at any time into 16,511,840 shares of common stock at a stock split adjusted conversion price of $24.225 per share (for more information see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 31, 2004, the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the carrying value of $400.0 million by approximately $117.0 million, which we believe reflects the increase in the market price of the Companys common stock to $26.52 per share as of December 31, 2004. Assuming other factors are held constant, an increase in interest rates generally results in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate convertible debt, but does not impact the carrying value, and an increase in the Companys stock price generally results in an increase in the fair value of convertible debt, but does not impact the carrying value. 50
