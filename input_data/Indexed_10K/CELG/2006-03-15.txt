ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION We are a multi national integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases. Our lead products are: REVLIMID(R), which gained recent FDA approval in MDS patients with the 5q chromosomal deletion and is under review by the FDA for multiple myeloma and THALOMID(R) (thalidomide), which is currently marketed for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, or ENL, and under review by the FDA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Over the past several years, THALOMID(R) net sales have grown steadily driven mainly by its off label use for treating multiple myeloma and other cancers. The sales growth of THALOMID(R) has enabled us to make substantial investments in research and development, which has advanced our broad portfolio of drug candidates in our product pipeline, including a pipeline of IMiDs(R) compounds, which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important properties. We believe that the sales growth of THALOMID(R), the growth potential for REVLIMID(R), the depth of our product pipeline, near term regulatory activities and clinical data reported at major medical conferences provide the catalyst for future growth. FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS Future operating results will depend on many factors, including demand for our products, regulatory approvals of our products, the timing and market acceptance of new products launched by us or competing companies, the timing of research and development milestones, challenges to our intellectual property and our ability to control costs. See also the Risk Factors discussion in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Some of the more salient factors that we are focused on are: the ability of REVLIMID(R) to successfully penetrate relevant markets; competitive risks; and our ability to advance clinical and regulatory programs. THE ABILITY OF REVLIMID(R) TO SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATE RELEVANT MARKETS: REVLIMID(R) was approved by the FDA on December 27, 2005 for the treatment of certain myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality and we have begun to execute our product launch strategies, which includes among other things: registering physicians in the RevAssist(sm) program, which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of 33 REVLIMID(R); sponsoring numerous medical education programs designed to educate physicians on MDS; and, partnering with contracted pharmacies to ensure safe and rapid distribution of REVLIMID(R). In addition, we have implemented an expanded access program to provide patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma free access to REVLIMID(R) while the FDA reviews our sNDA for that indication. We do not, however, have long term data on the use of the product and cannot predict whether REVLIMID(R) will gain widespread acceptance, which will mostly depend on the acceptance of regulators, physicians, patients and opinion leaders. The success of REVLIMID(R) will also depend, in part, on prescription drug coverage by government health agencies, commercial and employer health plans, and other third party payers. As an oral targeted cancer agent, REVLIMID(R) qualifies as a Medicare Part D drug. Each Part D plan will review REVLIMID(R) for addition to their formulary. As with all new products introduced into the market, there may be some lag time before being reviewed on each plans formulary. We are encouraged that during this formulary review process, patients have been given access to REVLIMID(R) and there have been no reported denials for coverage. COMPETITIVE RISKS: The landscape for the treatment of multiple myeloma and other cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases is highly competitive. While competition could reduce THALOMID(R) sales and limit REVLIMID(R) launch expectations, we do not believe that competing products will eliminate REVLIMID(R) and THALOMID(R) use entirely. In addition, generic competition could reduce THALOMID(R) sales. However, we own intellectual property which includes, for example, U.S. patents covering our S.T.E.P.S.(R) distribution program for the safer delivery of thalidomide, which all patients receiving thalidomide in the United States must follow. We also have exclusive rights to several issued patents covering the use of THALOMID(R) in oncology and other therapeutic areas. Even if generic competition were able to enter the market, we expect REVLIMID(R), which is now available commercially, to at least partially replace THALOMID(R) sales. ABILITY TO ADVANCE CLINICAL AND REGULATORY PROGRAMS: A major objective of our on going clinical trials programs is to broaden our knowledge about the full potential of REVLIMID(R) and to continue to evaluate the drug in a broad range of indications including lymphocytic leukemia, Non Hodgkins Lymphoma, Amyloidosis and myelofibrosis. The significant near term regulatory catalysts that we are focused on include: the FDAs decision regarding our sNDA for THALOMID(R) in multiple myeloma (a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date of May 25, 2006 has been set); the FDAs decision regarding our sNDA for REVLIMID(R) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma; and from an international perspective, the European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, decision regarding our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for REVLIMID(R) in MDS with the 5q chromosomal deletion. COMPANY BACKGROUND In 1986, we were spun off from Celanese Corporation and in July 1987 we completed an initial public offering. Initially, our operations involved research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Between 1990 and 1998, our revenues were derived primarily from the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development. By 1998, sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus and, in January 1998 we sold the chiral intermediates business to Cambrex Corporation. In July 1998, we received approval from the FDA to market THALOMID(R) for use in ENL, a complication of the treatment of leprosy, and in September 1998 we commenced sales of THALOMID(R) in the United States. Since then, sales of THALOMID(R) have grown significantly each year. In 2003, 2004 and 2005 we recorded net THALOMID(R) sales of $223.7 million, $308.6 million and $387.8 million, respectively. 34 In April 2000, we signed a licensing and development agreement with Novartis Pharma AG in which we granted to Novartis a license for FOCALIN(TM), our chirally pure version of RITALIN(R). The agreement provided for significant upfront and milestone payments to us based on the achievement of various stages in the regulatory approval process. It also provided for us to receive royalties on the entire family of RITALIN(R) products. Pursuant to the agreement we retained the rights to FOCALIN(TM) and FOCALIN XR(TM) in oncology indications. In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., now Celgene Research San Diego, a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease. In November 2001, we licensed to Pharmion Corporation exclusive rights relating to the development and commercial use of our intellectual property covering thalidomide and S.T.E.P.S(R) in all countries outside of North America, Japan, China, Taiwan and Korea (see our references below to the December 2004 amendment with respect to these territories). In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., a privately held biotherapeutics company developing processes for the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue following the completion of a successful full term pregnancy for use in stem cell transplantation, regenerative medicine and biomaterials for organ and wound repair. In March 2003, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, to distribute, promote and sell ALKERAN(R), or melphalan, a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. The agreement requires that we purchase ALKERAN(R) from GSK and distribute the products in the United States under the Celgene label. The agreement has been extended through March 31, 2009. In October 2004, we acquired Penn T Limited, or Penn T, a worldwide supplier of THALOMID(R). Through manufacturing agreements entered into with a third party in connection with this acquisition, we are able to control manufacturing for THALOMID(R) worldwide and we also increase our participation in the potential sales growth of THALOMID(R) in key international markets. In December 2004, following our acquisition of Penn T, we amended the thalidomide supply agreement with Pharmion and granted them license rights in additional territories. As amended, the territory licensed to Pharmion is for all countries other than the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and all provinces of China other than Hong Kong. On December 27, 2005, the FDA approved REVLIMID(R) for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate 1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Until 2003, we had sustained losses in each year since our incorporation in 1986. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 we posted net income of $25.7 million, $52.8 million and $63.7 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2005 we had an accumulated deficit of $170.8 million. We expect to make substantial additional expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products. We expect that our rate of spending will accelerate as a result of increases in clinical trial costs, expenses associated with regulatory approval and expenses related to commercialization of products currently in development. However, we anticipate these expenditures to be more than offset by increased product sales, royalties, revenues from various research collaborations and license agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, and investment income. 35 STOCK SPLIT On December 27, 2005, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a two for one stock split payable in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. Stockholders received one additional share for every share they owned as of the close of business on February 17, 2006. The additional shares were distributed on February 24, 2006. As a result, our authorized shares increased from 280,000,000 to 580,000,000 and shares outstanding increased from 172,057,726 shares to 344,115,452 shares as of the close of business on February 24, 2006. All share and per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the two for one stock split effective February 17, 2006. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003 TOTAL REVENUE: Total revenue and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, were as follows: % CHANGE 2004 2003 TO TO (IN THOUSANDS $) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Net product sales: THALOMID(R) $387,816 $308,577 $223,686 25.7% 38.0% FOCALIN(TM) 4,210 4,177 2,383 0.8% 75.3% ALKERAN(R) 49,748 16,956 17,827 193.4% (4.9%) REVLIMID(R) 2,862 N/A Other 989 861 557 14.9% 54.6% Total net product sales $445,625 $330,571 $244,453 34.8% 35.2% Collaborative agreements and other revenue 41,334 20,012 15,174 106.5% 31.9% Royalty revenue 49,982 26,919 11,848 85.7% 127.2% Total revenue $536,941 $377,502 $271,475 42.2% 39.1% NET PRODUCT SALES: 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: THALOMID(R) net sales were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to price increases implemented as we move towards a cost of therapy pricing structure as opposed to a price per milligram. Sales volumes decreased due to lower average daily doses; however, the total number of prescriptions for 2005 remained essentially flat when compared to the prior year period. Partially offsetting the increase in THALOMID(R) sales were higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns, Medicaid rebates and distributor chargebacks, which are recorded based on historical data. Included in 2005 were sales of $8.7 million from our U.K. subsidiary, CUK II, to Pharmion Corporation. Focalin(TM) net sales, which are dependent on the timing of orders from Novartis for their commercial distribution, were essentially flat when compared to the prior year period. ALKERAN(R) net sales were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, due to price increases implemented during 2005 and an increase in sales volumes. ALKERAN(R) use in combination therapies for the treatment of hematological diseases continues to grow driven by clinical data reported at major medical conferences around the world. Also contributing to the increase in ALKERAN(R) sales volumes was the resolution of supply disruptions experienced in 2004, which resolution led to more consistent supplies of ALKERAN(R) for injection and consequently more consistent end market buying patterns. REVLIMID(R) was approved by the FDA on December 27, 2005 and the first commercial sales were recorded relating to initial stocking at certain 36 contracted pharmacies that were registered under the RevAssist(TM) program. Other net product sales consist of sales of dehydrated human amniotic membrane for use in ophthalmic applications, which are generated through our Celgene Cellular Therapeutics division. 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: THALOMID(R) net sales were higher in 2004, as compared to 2003, primarily due to price increases implemented in the second half of 2003 and in the first nine months of 2004. The total number of prescriptions, which increased 9.4% from the prior year period, was offset by lower average daily doses. FOCALIN(TM) net sales were higher in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to the timing of shipments to Novartis for their commercial distribution. ALKERAN(R) net sales were lower in 2004, as compared to 2003, due to supply disruptions earlier in the year, which lead to inconsistent supplies of ALKERAN(R) IV and consequently inconsistent end market buying patterns. Other net product sales consist of sales of dehydrated human amniotic membrane for use in ophthalmic applications, which are generated through our Celgene Cellular Therapeutics division. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns, sales discounts, Medicaid rebates and distributor charge backs and services. Allowance for sales returns are based on the actual returns history for consumed lots and the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned. Sales discounts accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers. Medicaid rebate accruals are based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization. Distributor charge back accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs. Distributor services accruals are based on actual fees paid to wholesale distributors for services provided. Medicaid rebates and distributor charge backs increased due to higher sales volumes and price increases, which increase the respective rebate and chargeback amounts. The gross to net accrued balances were $34.2 million and $19.7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross to net sales accruals for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: % CHANGE 2004 2003 TO TO (IN THOUSANDS $) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 Gross product sales $548,853 $385,055 $283,208 42.5% 36.0% Less: Gross to net sales accruals Returns and allowances 21,256 16,279 12,659 30.6% 28.6% Discounts 10,948 7,448 5,503 47.0% 35.3% Medicaid rebates 35,098 15,780 12,975 122.4% 21.6% Distributor charge backs 33,658 14,977 7,618 124.7% 96.6% Distributor services 2,268 N/A N/A Total net product sales $445,625 $330,571 $244,453 34.8% 35.2% COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER REVENUE: Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources in 2005 included a $20.0 million milestone payment from Novartis for the NDA approval of Focalin XR(TM); $13.9 million related to our sponsored research, license and other agreements with Pharmion Corporation; $5.1 million from umbilical cord blood enrollment, collection and storage fees generated through our LifeBank USA(SM) business; $0.9 million for licensing to EntreMed, Inc. rights to develop and commercialize our tubulin inhibitor compounds; $0.5 million related to the agreements providing manufacturers of isotretinoin, a non exclusive license to our S.T.E.P.S.(R) patent portfolio encompassing restrictive drug distribution systems; and, $0.9 million from other miscellaneous research and development agreements. Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources in 2004 included a 37 $7.5 million milestone payment from Novartis related to their FOCALIN(R) XR NDA submission; $7.5 million related to our sponsored research, license and other agreements with Pharmion Corporation; $3.7 million of umbilical cord blood enrollment, collection and storage fees generated through our Celgene Cellular Therapeutics division; $0.5 million related to the agreements providing manufacturers of isotretinoin, a non exclusive license to our S.T.E.P.S.(R) patent portfolio encompassing restrictive drug distribution systems; and $0.8 million from other miscellaneous research and development and licensing agreements. Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources in 2003 included $6.0 million related to the agreement to terminate the Gelclair(TM) co promotion agreement with OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc.; $4.3 million of thalidomide research and development funding and S.T.E.P.S. licensing fees received in connection with the Pharmion collaboration agreements; $1.3 million of reimbursements from Novartis for shipments of bulk raw material used in the formulation of FOCALIN(R) XR and utilized in clinical studies conducted by Novartis; $2.9 million of umbilical cord blood enrollment, collection and storage fees generated through our Stem Cell Therapies segment; and $0.7 million from other miscellaneous research and development and licensing agreements. ROYALTY REVENUE: Royalty revenue in 2005 included $48.5 million of royalties received from Novartis on sales of their entire family of Ritalin(R) drugs and Focalin XR(TM), which gained FDA approval on May 27, 2005; $0.6 million of royalties received from Pharmion on their commercial sales of THALOMID(R), and $0.8 million of miscellaneous other royalties. Royalty revenue in 2004 and 2003 was $26.9 million and $11.8 million, respectively, and consisted solely of royalties received from Novartis on sales of their entire family of RITALIN(R) drugs. The year over year increases in Ritalin(R) royalty revenue was due to increases in the royalty rate on both Ritalin(R) and Ritalin(R) LA as well as an increase in Ritalin(R) LA sales by Novartis. COST OF GOODS SOLD: Cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS $) 2005 2004 2003 Cost of goods sold $ 80,727 $ 59,726 $ 52,950 Increase from prior year $ 21,001 $ 6,776 $ 32,083 Percentage increase from prior year 35.2% 12.8% 153.7% Percentage of net product sales 18.1% 18.1% 21.7% 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Cost of goods sold were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to higher royalties on THALOMID(R) net sales and higher ALKERAN(R) costs as a result of higher sales volumes. As a percentage of net product sales, cost of goods sold in 2005 were in line with 2004. 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: Cost of goods sold increased in 2004 from 2003, primarily as a result of higher royalties paid on THALOMID(R), partially offset by lower ALKERAN(R) costs. As a percentage of net product sales, however, cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower ALKERAN(R) costs. Profit margins on THALOMID(R) remained flat, as the increase in cost of goods sold (resulting from higher royalties paid) were offset by higher net sales (which were due to price increases implemented in the second half of 2003 and in the first nine months of 2004). RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor fees (paid principally to contract research organizations to assist in our clinical development programs), costs of drug supplies for our clinical and preclinical programs, costs of other 38 consumable research supplies, regulatory and quality expenditures and allocated facilities charges such as building rent and utilities. Research and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS $) 2005 2004 2003 Research and development expenses $ 190,834 $ 160,852 $ 122,700 Increase from prior year $ 29,982 $ 38,152 $ 37,776 Percentage increase from prior year 18.6% 31.1% 44.5% Percentage of total revenue 35.5% 42.6% 45.2% 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Research and development expenses were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to higher costs to support further clinical development and regulatory advancement of REVLIMID(R) Phase II and Phase III programs in myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma, including the ongoing pivotal Phase III MDS deletion 5q trial to support our MAA seeking approval to market REVLIMID(R) in Europe. Research and development expenses are targeted to increase 20 to 25 percent in 2006 in support of our ongoing global regulatory filings, late stage clinical trials and clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs. 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: Research and development expenses increased by $38.2 million in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to increased spending in various late stage regulatory programs such as Phase II regulatory programs for REVLIMID(R) in myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma, including ongoing REVLIMID(R) Phase III SPA trials in multiple myeloma. Research and development expenses in 2005 consisted of $73.9 million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs; $69.1 million spent on other pharmaceutical programs, including toxicology, analytical research and development, drug discovery, quality assurance and regulatory affairs; $36.9 million spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and $10.9 million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs. These expenditures support multiple core programs, including REVLIMID(R), THALOMID(R), CC 10004, CC 4047, CC 11006, TNF(alpha) inhibitors, other investigational compounds, such as kinase inhibitors, benzopyranones and ligase inhibitors and placental and cord blood derived stem cell programs. Research and development expenses in 2004 consisted of $67.0 million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs; $44.7 million spent on other human pharmaceutical programs, including toxicology, analytical research and development, drug discovery, quality assurance and regulatory affairs; $40.6 million spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and $8.6 million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs. In 2003, $47.6 million was spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs; $34.4 million was spent on other human pharmaceutical programs, including toxicology, analytical research and development, drug discovery, quality assurance and regulatory affairs; $33.7 million was spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and $7.0 million was spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs. As total revenue increases, research and development expense may continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue, however the actual dollar amount may continue to increase as earlier stage compounds are moved through the preclinical and clinical stages. Due to the significant risk factors and uncertainties inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects, the cost to complete such projects can vary. The data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent a projects advancement through 39 the various stages of clinical development, which would significantly impact the costs incurred to bring a project to completion. For information about the commercial and development status and target diseases of our drug compounds, refer to the product overview table contained in Part I, Item I of this annual report. In general, the estimated times to completion within the various stages of clinical development are as follows: CLINICAL PHASE ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME Phase I 1 2 years Phase II 2 3 years Phase III 2 3 years Due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in preclinical testing and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects, the cost to complete such projects is not reasonably estimable. The data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent a projects advancement through the various stages of clinical development, which would significantly impact the costs incurred in completing a project. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE: Selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for sales and marketing and customer service personnel and other commercial expenses to support our sales force. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, outside services for legal, audit, tax and investor activities and allocations of facilities costs, principally for rent, utilities and property taxes. Selling, general and administrative expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS $) 2005 2004 2003 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 181,796 $ 114,196 $ 98,474 Increase from prior year $ 67,600 $ 15,722 $ 32,302 Percentage increase from prior year 59.2% 16.0% 48.8% Percentage of total revenue 33.9% 30.3% 36.3% 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to the inclusion in 2005 of approximately $40.0 million of REVLIMID(R) pre launch commercial expenses, such as global market research, marketing and educational programs and sales and marketing training and an increase of approximately $22.7 million in general administrative expenses resulting from higher professional and other miscellaneous outside service fees, higher personnel related expenses, higher facility related expenses and higher insurance costs, offset by lower THALOMID(R) and ALKERAN(R) related marketing expenses. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2005 was $2.5 million of expense related to accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements at four New Jersey locations being consolidated into our new corporate headquarters. Selling, general and administrative expenses are targeted to increase 10 to 15 percent in 2006; in addition, international selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be in a range 40 of $30 to $35 million for ongoing expansion of commercial and manufacturing capabilities in Europe. Actual expenses will be dependent on the progress of discussions with the international regulatory authorities. 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $15.7 million in 2004 from 2003, as a result of an increase of approximately $12.0 million in general administrative and medical affairs expenses primarily due to higher headcount related expenses and an increase of approximately $3.6 million in sales force expenses primarily due to the creation of a sales operations group. The sales operations group, among other things, manages pricing and reimbursement, corporate accounts, customer service and government affairs, as well as sales fleet expenses. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET: Interest and other income, net in 2005 included $27.7 million of interest and realized gains on our cash, and cash equivalents and marketable securities portfolio, offset by unrealized losses of $6.9 million for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants prior to our March 31, 2005 exercise, $3.1 million for other than temporary impairment write downs recognized on two securities held in our available for sales marketable securities portfolio and $0.7 million of foreign exchange and other miscellaneous net losses. Interest and other income, net in 2004 included $28.3 million of interest and realized gains on our cash, and cash eqivalents and marketable securities portfolio and $3.6 million of foreign exchange and other miscellaneous net gains, offset by an unrealized losses of $1.9 million for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants. Interest and other income, net in 2003 included $21.8 million of interest and realized gains on our cash, and cash equivalents and marketable securities portfolio and $16.6 million of unrealized gains for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants. EQUITY IN LOSSES OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES: On March 31, 2005, we exercised warrants to purchase 7,000,000 shares of EntreMed, Inc. common stock. Since we also hold 3,350,000 shares of EntreMed voting preferred shares that are convertible into 16,750,000 shares of common stock, we determined that we have significant influence over EntreMed and are applying the equity method of accounting to our common stock investment effective March 31, 2005. Under the equity method of accounting, we recorded equity losses of $6.9 million in 2005, which includes a charge of $4.4 million to write down the value of the investment ascribed to in process research and development, $0.2 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, $1.6 million to record our share of EntreMed losses and a charge of $0.7 million to eliminate our share of THALOMID(R) royalties payable to EntreMed, Inc. During 2003, we recorded $4.4 million for our share of the EntreMed losses until the investment was written down to zero in the third quarter of 2003. On February 2, 2006 we, along with a group of other investors, entered into an agreement to invest $30.0 million in EntreMed in return for newly issued EntreMed common stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of EntreMed common stock at a conversion price of $2.3125 per warrant. Our portion of the investment was $2.0 million for which we received 864,864 shares of EntreMed common stock and 432,432 warrants. The warrants will be accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through earnings. INTEREST EXPENSE: Interest expense was $9.5 million, $9.6 million and $5.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and primarily reflects interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400 million convertible notes issued on June 3, 2003. Interest expense in 2003 only includes seven months of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs. INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION): The income tax provision for 2005 was $20.6 million and reflects tax expense impacted by certain expenses incurred outside the United States for which no tax benefits can be recorded offset by the benefit from elimination of valuation allowances totaling $42.6 million as of March 31, 2005, which was based on the fact that we determined it was more likely than not that certain benefits of our deferred tax assets 41 would be realized. This determination was based upon the external Independent Data Monitoring Committees, or IDMC, analyses of two Phase III Special Protocol Assessment multiple myeloma trials and the conclusion that these trials exceeded the pre specified stopping rule. The IDMC found a statistically significant improvement in time to disease progression the primary endpoint of these Phase III trials in patients receiving REVLIMID(R) plus dexamethasone compared to patients receiving dexamethasone alone. This, in concert with our nine consecutive quarters of profitability, led to the conclusion that is was more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets. The elimination of valuation allowances relating to certain historical acquisitions were first offset against goodwill and intangibles with the balance applied to reduce income tax expense. The elimination of valuation allowances relating to tax deductions that arose in connection with stock option exercises were offset against components of equity. The income tax provision for 2004 was $10.4 million, which reflects an effective underlying tax rate of 16.5%. Our tax rate in 2004 rose from 2003 primarily due to federal tax expense and decreases in the valuation allowance available to offset income tax expense. In 2003, our income tax provision was $0.7 million and included income tax expense of $1.1 million for federal and state purposes, offset by a tax benefit of $0.4 million from the sale of certain state net operating loss carryforwards. GAIN ON SALE OF CHIRAL ASSETS: In January 1998, we completed the sale of our chiral intermediate business to Cambrex Corporation. Pursuant to the minimum royalty provisions of the agreement, we received $0.8 million in 2003. NET INCOME: Net income and per common share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 63,656 $ 52,756 $ 24,943 Per common share amounts: Basic $ 0.19 $ 0.16 $ 0.08 Diluted $ 0.18 $ 0.15 $ 0.08 Weighted average number of shares of common stock utilized to calculate per common share amounts: Basic 335,512 327,738 323,548 Diluted 390,585 345,710 341,592 Amounts have been adjusted for the two for one stock splits effected in February 2006 and October 2004. 42 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Net income and per common share amounts were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in total revenues of $159.4 million (driven primarily by a $79.2 million increase in THALOMID(R) net sales, a $32.8 million increase in ALKERAN(R) net sales, a $21.8 million increase in royalty revenues received from Novartis related to the Ritalin(R) line of drugs and Focalin XR(TM) and a $12.5 million increase in milestone payments from Novartis related to Focalin XR(TM)) offset by higher operating expenses of $118.6 million (driven by REVLIMID(R) clinical and regulatory research and development costs and REVLIMID(R) pre launch selling, general and administrative costs) and unrealized losses recorded in 2005 of $6.9 million for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants prior to our March 31, 2005 exercise, $3.1 million for other than temporary impairment write downs recognized on two securities held in our available for sales marketable securities portfolio and our share of equity losses of EntreMed, Inc. of $6.9 million. 2004 COMPARED TO 2003: Income from continuing operations increased in 2004 from 2003 due to an increase in total revenue of $106.0 million (attributable primarily to an increase in THALOMID(R) net sales) partly offset by higher operating expenses of $60.7 million and a decrease in interest and other income, net of $7.9 million (attributable to a $1.9 million decrease in fair value of EntreMed warrants versus a prior year increase of $16.6 million partly offset by an increase in interest income and foreign exchange gains and the inclusion in 2003 of equity losses of associated companies of $4.4 million). LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash provided by operating activities was $41.9 million in 2005, as compared to $155.9 million in 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher working capital levels and higher income taxes paid, partially offset by higher net income in 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 increased $137.2 million from 2003. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher earnings, the receipt of $80.0 million in connection with the December 2004 THALOMID(R) development and commercialization collaboration with Pharmion and a decrease in net working capital levels. Net cash used in investing activities was $103.1 million in 2005 and included cash outflows of $35.9 million for capital expenditures, $7.2 million for acquisition costs and working capital adjustments related to the October 2004 acquisition of Penn T, $49.5 million for net purchases of available for sale marketable securities and $10.5 million for the exercise of warrants to purchase 7,000,000 shares of EntreMed common stock. Net cash used in investing activities was $92.6 million in 2004 and included cash outflows of $109.9 million for the October 2004 acquisition of Penn T, $7.0 million for an investment and $36.0 million for capital expenditures. Partially offsetting these outflows were cash inflows of $60.3 million from net sales of available for sale marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities was $443.6 million in 2003 and included cash outflows of $421.2 million for net purchases of available for sale marketable securities, $12.0 million for the purchase of a Pharmion Corporation senior convertible note and $11.2 million for capital expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities was $52.6 million, $16.0 million and $399.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and included cash inflows from the exercise of common stock options and warrants of $52.6 million, $16.0 million and $12.0 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Included in 2003 were cash inflows of $387.8 million from net proceeds of the issuance of our convertible notes on June 3, 2003. Currency rate changes negatively impacted our cash and cash equivalents balances by $3.3 million and $4.4 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005, cash, cash equivalents and 43 marketable securities were $724.3 million, a decrease of $24.3 million from December 31, 2004 levels. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a reduction in unrealized gains on our available for sale marketable securities portfolio. We expect increased research and product development costs, clinical trial costs, expenses associated with the regulatory approval process and commercialization of products and capital investments. In addition, we expect increased commercial expenses, such as marketing and market research. However, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale, combined with expected net product sales and revenues from various research, collaboration and royalties agreements are expected to provide sufficient capital resources to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005: PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN MORE THAN (IN MILLIONS $) 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 3 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL Convertible note obligations $ $ 400.0 $ $ $ 400.0 Operating leases 3.4 5.5 5.0 3.9 17.8 ALKERAN(R) supply agreements 34.7 67.3 102.0 Other contract commitments 4.5 7.3 2.0 13.8 $ 42.6 $ 480.1 $ 7.0 $ 3.9 $ 533.6 CONVERTIBLE DEBT: In June 2003, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured convertible notes. The convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi annually. The convertible notes can be converted at any time into 33,022,360 shares of common stock at a stock split adjusted conversion price of $12.1125 per share. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the carrying value of $400.0 million by $660.0 million (for more information see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). OPERATING (FACILITIES) LEASES: We occupy the following facilities under lease arrangements that have remaining lease terms greater than one year. o 73,500 square feet of laboratory and office space in Warren, New Jersey. The two leases for this facility have terms ending in May 2007 and July 2010, respectively, and each have two five year renewal options. Annual rent for these facilities is $0.8 million. o 78,202 square feet of laboratory and office space in San Diego, California. The lease for this facility has a term ending in August 2012 with one five year renewal option. Annual rent for this facility is $2.0 million and is subject to specified annual rental increases. o 20,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in Cedar Knolls, New Jersey. The leases for this facility have terms ending between September 2007 and April 2009 with renewal options ranging from either one or two additional five year terms. Annual rent for this facility is $0.3 million and is subject to specified annual rental increases. 44 o 11,000 square feet of laboratory space in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The lease for this facility has a term ending in May 2008 with one three year renewal option. Annual rent for this facility is $0.1 million. Under these lease arrangements, we also are required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs. All leases are with unaffiliated parties. For a schedule of payments related to operating leases, refer to Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ALKERAN(R) PURCHASE COMMITMENTS: In March 2003, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, to distribute, promote and sell ALKERAN(R) (melphalan), a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. Under the terms of the agreement, we purchase ALKERAN(R) tablets and ALKERAN(R) for infusion from GSK and distributes the products in the United States under the Celgene label. The agreement requires us to purchase certain minimum quantities each year under a take or pay arrangement. The agreement has been extended through March 31, 2009. On December 31, 2005, the remaining minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled $102.0 million. OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: We signed an exclusive license agreement with CMCC, which terminated any existing thalidomide analog agreements between CMCC and EntreMed and directly granted to Celgene an exclusive worldwide license for the analog patents. Under the agreement, we are required to pay CMCC $2.0 million between 2005 and 2006. The outstanding balance related to this agreement was $1.0 million at December 31, 2005. Additional payments are possible under the agreement depending on the successful development and commercialization of thalidomide analogs. In connection with the acquisition of Penn T on October 21, 2004, we entered into a Technical Services Agreement with Penn Pharmaceutical Services Limited, or PPSL, and Penn Pharmaceutical Holding Limited pursuant to which PPSL provides the services and facilities necessary for the manufacture of THALOMID(R) and other thalidomide formulations. The total cost to be incurred over the five year minimum agreement period is approximately $11.0 million. At December 31, 2005, the remaining cost to be incurred was approximately $7.8 million. In October 2003, we signed an agreement with Institute of Drug Technology Australia Limited, or IDT, for the manufacture of finished dosage form of THALOMID(R) capsules. The agreement requires minimum payments for THALOMID(R) capsules of $4.7 million for the three year term commencing with the FDAs approval of IDT as an alternate supplier. The FDA granted IDT approval to manufacture THALOMID(R) capsules in April 2005. The agreement provides us with additional capacity and reduces our dependency on one manufacturer for the production of THALOMID(R). At December 31, 2005, the remaining minimum obligation under this agreement was $4.0 million. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, "Share Based Payment," or SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R requires compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS 123R covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options, restricted stock plans, performance based awards, stock appreciation rights, and employee stock purchase plans. SFAS 123R replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS No. 123, as originally issued in 1995, established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees. 45 However, SFAS No. 123 permitted entities to continue to apply the guidance in APB Opinion No. 25, as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used. We will be required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Management is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. The adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 1, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for the pro forma impact on net income and net income per share from calculating stock based compensation cost under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123. However, the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of SFAS No. 123R may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under SFAS No. 123. In December 2005, in recognition of the significance of the REVLIMID(R) regulatory approval, the Board of Directors approved a resolution to grant the 2006 annual stock option awards in 2005 pursuant to the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 1998 Plan, and the 1995 Non Employee Directors Incentive Plan. All stock options awarded pursuant to the 1998 Plan were granted fully vested, with half issued at an exercise price, or strike price, of $34.05 per option and the other half issued at a strike price of $35.67 per option, which was at a premium to the closing price of $32.43 per share, adjusted for the February 17, 2006 two for one stock split, of our common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the grant date of December 29, 2005. The Boards decision to grant these options was in recognition of the REVLIMID(R) regulatory approval and in response to a review of our long term incentive compensation programs in light of changes in market practices and recently issued changes in accounting rules resulting from the issuance of FASB No. 123R, which we are required to adopt effective the first quarter of 2006. Management believes that granting these options prior to the adoption of FASB No. 123R will result in our not being required to recognize cumulative compensation expense of approximately $70.8 million for the four year period ending December 31, 2009. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs An Amendment of ARB No. 43. This Statement amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). The new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal" as stated in ARB No. 43. Additionally, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this pronouncement on its financial position and results of operations. Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 03 01, "The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments," or EITF 03 01, was issued in February 2004. The provisions of EITF 03 01 for measuring and recognizing an other than temporary impairment proved controversial and as a result, FASB Staff Position ("FSP") FSP 115 1 and FSP 124 1 "The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" was issued in November 2005, clarifying the requirements of EITF 03 01 concerning the evaluation of whether an impairment is other than temporary. FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 refers to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") Topic 5M, "Other Than Temporary Impairment of Certain Investments In Debt And Equity Securities," and EITF Issue No. 99 20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interest in Securitized Financial Assets," to evaluate whether an impairment is other than temporary. We are in compliance with these requirements and continue to monitor these developments to assess the possible impact on our financial position and results of operations. 46 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical: REVENUE RECOGNITION ON COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS: We have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies. These agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements. The agreements are for both early and late stage compounds and are focused on specific disease areas. For the early stage compounds, the agreements are relatively short term agreements that are renewable depending on the success of the compounds as they move through preclinical development. The agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments, milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events, and in some cases ongoing research funding. The agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives FDA marketing approval. Our revenue recognition policies for all nonrefundable upfront license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," as amended by SAB No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," or SAB 104. In addition, we follow the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue, or EITF, 00 21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," or EITF 00 21, for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after June 30, 2003. EITF 00 21 provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if this division is required, how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting. If the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the EITFs separation criteria, the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit. If the arrangement is a single unit of accounting, the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement. In accordance with SAB 104, upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period of the last item of performance to be delivered. If the estimated service period is subsequently modified, the period over which the upfront fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis. Revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones, which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process are recognized when and if the milestones are achieved. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, MEDICAID REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS: We record an allowance for sales returns based on the actual returns history for consumed lots and the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned. We record sales discounts accruals based on payment terms extended to customers. We record Medicaid rebate accruals based on historical payment data and estimates of Medicaid beneficiary utilization. We record distributor charge back accruals based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs. We record distributor services accruals based on actual fees paid to wholesale distributors for services provided. 47 INCOME TAXES: We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE FOR SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security established. Factors evaluated to determine if an investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the issuer; adverse changes in the general market condition in which the issuer operates; the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment; and, issues that raise concerns about the issuers ability to continue as a going concern. At the end of 2005, we determined that two securities with an amortized cost basis of $7.0 million had sustained an other than temporary impairment and recognized a $3.1 million impairment loss, which was recorded in interest and other income, net. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: The recorded liability for long term incentive plans was $8.3 million as of December 31, 2005. Plan payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the participants salary for the 2005 Plan, 0% to 150% of the participants salary for the 2006 Plan and 0% to 200% of the participants salary for the 2007 Plan. The 2006 performance cycle was approved by the Management Compensation and Development Committee of the Board of Directors on January 19, 2006 and began on January 1, 2006 and will end on December 31, 2008, or the 2008 Plan. Plan payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the participants salary for the 2008 Plan. The estimated payout for the 2005 Plan is $4.5 million and maximum potential payouts are $4.5 million, $6.8 million and $7.2 million for the 2006, 2007 and 2008 Plans, respectively. The Company accrues the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle. Prior to the end of a three year cycle, our accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award, or, if higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings. We have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions. Although investments may be subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment. At December 31, 2005, our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale and unsecured convertible notes issued by us. The Company may periodically utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. At December 31, 2005, we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding to buy U.S. dollars and sell Swiss francs for a notional amount of $62.0 million. The forward contract expires on April 13, 2006 and is an economic hedge of a U.S. dollar payable of a Swiss foreign entity, which is remeasured through earnings each period based on changes in the spot rate. The unrealized loss on the forward contract, based on its fair value at December 31, 2005, was approximately $0.2 million, and was recorded in accrued expenses with the offsetting loss recorded in earnings. Assuming that the year end exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc were to adversely change by a hypothetical ten percent, the change in the fair value of the contract would decrease by approximately $6.4 million. However, since the contract hedges foreign currency payables, any change in the fair value of the contract would be offset by a change in the underlying value of the hedged item. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: At December 31, 2005, our marketable securities available for sale consisted of U.S. government agency securities, mortgage backed obligations, corporate debt securities and 1,939,600 shares of Pharmion common stock. Marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value, are held for an indefinite period of time and are intended to be used to meet our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax. The cost of all 48 debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses, is included in interest and other income, net. At the end of 2005, we determined that two securities with an amortized cost basis of $7.0 million had sustained an other than temporary impairment and recognized a $3.1 million impairment loss related to these securities due to reductions in their future estimated cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, the principal amounts, fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows: DURATION LESS THAN 1 1 TO 3 3 TO 5 5 TO 7 OVER 7 (IN THOUSANDS $) YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS YEARS TOTAL Principal amount $ 272,760 $74,904 $227,402 $3,000 $2,900 $580,966 Fair value $ 272,857 $75,714 $213,070 $1,980 $2,856 $566,477 Average interest rate 4.4% 4.7% 4.4% 7.1% N/A 4.5% PHARMION COMMON STOCK: At December 31, 2005, we held a total of 1,939,600 shares of Pharmion Corporation common stock, which had an estimated fair value of approximately $34.5 million (based on the closing price reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, or NASDAQ system, and, which exceeded the cost by approximately $14.3 million. The amount by which the fair value exceeded the cost (i.e., the unrealized gain) was included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Pharmion common stock investment is subject to market price volatility and any increase or decrease in Pharmions common stock quoted market price will have a similar percentage increase or decrease in the fair value of our investment. CONVERTIBLE DEBT: In June 2003, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured convertible notes. The convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi annually. The convertible notes can be converted at any time into 33,022,360 shares of common stock at a stock split adjusted conversion price of $12.1125 per share (for more information see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 31, 2005, the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the carrying value of $400.0 million by approximately $660.0 million, which we believe reflects the increase in the market price of our common stock to $32.40 per share, on a split adjusted basis, as of December 31, 2005. Assuming other factors are held constant, an increase in interest rates generally results in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate convertible debt, but does not impact the carrying value, and an increase in our stock price generally results in an increase in the fair value of convertible debt, but does not impact the carrying value.
