ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION We are a global integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases. Our lead products are: REVLIMID(R) (lenalidomide), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in December 2005 for treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate 1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities and in June 2006 for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy; and, THALOMID(R) (thalidomide), which gained FDA approval in May 2006 for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and which is also approved in erythema nodosum leprosum, an inflammatory complication of leprosy. Over the past several years, our total revenues have increased led by REVLIMID(R) and THALOMID(R) sales growth. This growth has enabled us to make substantial investments in research and development and thus, advance our broad portfolio of drug candidates in our product pipeline, including our IMiDs(R) compounds, which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important properties. We believe that the commercial potential of REVLIMID(R) and THALOMID(R), the depth of our product pipeline, near term regulatory activities and clinical data reported 39 both at major medical conferences and in peer reviewed publications provide the catalysts for our future growth. FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS Future operating results will depend on many factors, including demand for our products, regulatory approvals of our products and product candidates, the timing and market acceptance of new products launched by us or competing companies, the timing of research and development milestones, challenges to our intellectual property and our ability to control costs. See also the Risk Factors discussion contained in Part I, Item 1A. Some of the more salient factors that we are focused on include: the ability of REVLIMID(R) to successfully penetrate relevant markets; our ability to advance clinical and regulatory programs and competitive risks. THE ABILITY OF REVLIMID(R) TO SUCCESSFULLY PENETRATE RELEVANT MARKETS: Our REVLIMID(R) launch strategy has included among otheR things: registering physicians in the RevAssist(R) program, which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of REVLIMID(R); partnering with contracted pharmacies to ensure, to the maximum extent possible, safe and rapid distribution of REVLIMID(R); and, transitioning previously treated multiple myeloma patients from our expanded access program, which provided patients with free access to REVLIMID(R), to commercial paying patients as a result of the June 2006 approval in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy. While these initiatives appear to have resulted in a highly visible and successful product launch, we remain focused on ensuring REVLIMID(R)s continued market penetration in both multiple myeloma and MDS. We do not have long term data on the use of the product and cannot predict whether REVLIMID(R) will gain widespread acceptance, which will mostly depend on the acceptance of regulators, physicians, patients, payors and opinion leaders. The success of REVLIMID(R) will also depend, in part, on prescription drug coverage by government health agencies, commercial and employer health plans, and other third party payors. As an oral cancer agent, REVLIMID(R) qualifies as a Medicare, Part D drug. Each Part D plan will review REVLIMID(R) for addition to their formulary. As with all new products introduced into the market, there may be some lag time before being added to each plans formulary, which may impact our commercial performance. THE ABILITY TO ADVANCE REGULATORY AND CLINICAL PROGRAMS: Obtaining international regulatory approvals beginning with Europe is a key component of our continued growth strategy. We currently have two REVLIMID(R) Marketing Authorization Applications, or MAAs, under review by the European Medicines Agency, or EMEA. The MAAs seek approval to market REVLIMID(R) in both multiple myeloma and MDS with the 5q chromosomal deletion. The timing of European approval is unpredictable. Moreover, the period of time it takes to obtain pricing and reimbursement approvals in each country could further delay our international growth strategy. A major objective of our on going clinical programs is to broaden our knowledge about the full potential of REVLIMID(R) and our other proprietary IMiDs(R) compounds and to continue to evaluate them in a broad range of hematological malignancies and other cancers. Our near term focus is on evaluating REVLIMID(R) as a treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and aggressive non Hodgkins lymphomas. COMPETITIVE RISKS: While competition could limit REVLIMID(R) and THALOMID(R) sales, we do not believe that competing products would eliminate their use entirely. Moreover, while generic competitors could seek to challenge our THALOMID(R) franchise, we own intellectual property which includes, for example, U.S. patents covering our S.T.E.P.S.(R) distribution program for the safe distribution and appropriate use of thalidomide, which all physicians, patients and pharmacies prescribing, receiving or dispensing thalidomide in the United States must follow. We also have exclusive rights to several issued patents covering the use of THALOMID(R) in oncology and other therapeutic areas. 40 COMPANY BACKGROUND o In 1986, we were spun off from Celanese Corporation and, in July 1987, we completed an initial public offering. Initially, our operations involved research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Between 1990 and 1998, our revenues were derived primarily from the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development. By 1998, sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus and, in January 1998, we sold the chiral intermediates business to Cambrex Corporation. o In July 1998, we received approval from the FDA to market THALOMID(R) for the treatment and suppression of ENL, an inflammatory complication of leprosy. Sales of THALOMID(R) have grown significantly each year since then. In 2004, 2005 and 2006 we recorded net THALOMID(R) sales of $308.6 million, $387.8 million and $433.0 million, respectively. o In April 2000, we entered into a development and license agreement with Novartis Pharma AG in which we granted to Novartis an exclusive worldwide license to further develop and market FOCALIN(TM), our chirally pure version of RITALIN(R). The agreement provided for significant upfront and milestone payments to us based on the achievement of various stages in the regulatory approval process. Under the agreement, we sell FOCALIN(TM) to Novartis as well as receive royalties on all of Novartis sales of FOCALIN XR(TM) and RITALIN(R) family of ADHD related products. o In August 2000, we acquired Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., d/b/a Celgene Research San Diego, a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease. o In November 2001, we licensed to Pharmion Corporation exclusive rights relating to the development and commercial use of our intellectual property covering thalidomide and S.T.E.P.S(R) in all countries outside of North America, Japan, China, Taiwan and Korea (see our references below to the December 2004 amendment with respect to these territories). o In December 2002, we acquired Anthrogenesis Corp., a privately held biotherapeutics company developing processes for the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue following the completion of a successful full term pregnancy for use in stem cell transplantation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, regenerative medicine and biomaterials for organ and wound repair. o In March 2003, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, to distribute, promote and sell ALKERAN(R), or melphalan, a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. The agreement requires that we purchase ALKERAN(R) from GSK and distribute the products in the United States under the Celgene label. The agreement has been extended through March 31, 2009. o In October 2004, we acquired Penn T Limited, or Penn T, a worldwide supplier of THALOMID(R). Through manufacturing agreements acquired in the transaction, we are able to control manufacturing for THALOMID(R) worldwide. In the transaction, we also acquired a product supply agreement to exclusively supply Pharmion with thalidomide, thereby enabling us to increase our participation in thalidomide sales in key international markets. Subsequently, in December 2004, we amended the thalidomide supply agreement with Pharmion and granted them license rights in additional territories. As amended, the territory licensed to Pharmion is for all countries other than the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan and all provinces of China other than Hong Kong. 41 o In December 2005, the FDA approved REVLIMID(R) for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate 1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities and, in June 2006, the FDA approved REVLIMID(R) for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy. In May 2006, we also received an additional approval from the FDA to market THALOMID(R) for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. o In November 2006, we issued an additional 20,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $51.60 per share with gross proceeds of $1.032 billion and proceeds, net of the underwriters discount, of $1.006 billion. o In December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility and certain assets and liabilities from Siegfried located in Zofingen, Switzerland. The API facility has the capability to produce multiple drug substances and initially will be used to produce REVLIMID(R) API to supply global markets. The facility also may be used to produce drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004 TOTAL REVENUE: Total revenue and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, were as follows: % CHANGE 2005 2004 TO TO (IN THOUSANDS $) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Net product sales: REVLIMID(R) 320,558 2,862 N/A N/A THALOMID(R) 432,950 387,816 308,577 11.6% 25.7% ALKERAN(R) 50,337 49,748 16,956 1.2% 193.4% FOCALIN(TM) 7,340 4,210 4,177 74.3% 0.8% Other 420 989 861 (57.5)% 14.9% Total net product sales $811,605 $445,625 $330,571 82.1% 34.8% Collaborative agreements and other revenue 18,189 41,334 20,012 (56.0)% 106.5% Royalty revenue 69,079 49,982 26,919 38.2% 85.7% Total revenue $898,873 $536,941 $377,502 67.4% 42.2% NET PRODUCT SALES: 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: REVLIMID(R) net sales recorded in 2005 related to initial stocking at certain contracted pharmacies following the products approval on December 27, 2005. REVLIMID(R) net sales grew consistently each quarter in 2006 driven primarily by the additional approval in June 2006 for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. Also contributing to the 2006 sales growth was the impact of transitioning patients from our expanded access program, which provided patients with free access to REVLIMID(R), to commercial paying patients. Multiple myeloma accounted for approximately 56% of all commercial dispenses during 2006, followed by MDS, which accounted for approximately 38% of all commercial dispenses, and a broad range of other cancer indications accounted for the remaining commercial dispenses. In Europe, we have made REVLIMID(R) available under a Named Patient Program, or NPP, 42 which offers European patients in need access to REVLIMID(R) on a compassionate use basis while the European Medicines Agency, or EMEA, reviews our application seeking approval to market REVLIMID(R) as a treatment for multiple myeloma and MDS. NPP sales totaled 7.8% of total REVLIMID(R) net sales during 2006. We expect continued incremental benefit from the named patient sales leading up to a potential European approval in 2007. Supported by the FDAs approval of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and newly presented data, THALOMID(R) net sales were higher in 2006, compared to 2005. Price increases implemented as we continue to move towards a cost of therapy pricing structure as opposed to a price per milligram basis also contributed to the increase. Sales volumes decreased due to continued average daily dose declines as well as a small decrease in the total number of prescriptions. Partially offsetting the increase in THALOMID(R) sales were higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and distributor chargebacks, partially offset by lower Medicaid rebate accruals, which are recorded based on historical data. ALKERAN(R) net sales were slightly higher in 2006, compared to 2005. ALKERAN(R) sales benefited from an increase in ALKERAN(R) tablet sales volumes, as well as price increases implemented during 2006, particularly in ALKERAN(R) IVs (i.e., injectables). Largely offsetting the increase in sales were higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and distributor chargebacks. Sales of FOCALIN(TM), which is sold exclusively to Novartis and is dependent on the timing of orders from Novartis for their commercial distribution, were higher in 2006, compared to 2005, due to increased end market demand. 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: THALOMID(R) net sales were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to price increases implemented as we moved towards a cost of therapy pricing structure as opposed to a price per milligram. Sales volumes decreased due to lower average daily doses; however, the total number of prescriptions for 2005 remained essentially flat when compared to the prior year period. Partially offsetting the increase in THALOMID(R) sales were higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns, Medicaid rebates and distributor chargebacks, which are recorded based on historical data. Focalin(TM) net sales, which are dependent on the timing of orders from Novartis for their commercial distribution, were essentially flat when compared to the prior year period. ALKERAN(R) net sales were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, due to price increases implemented during 2005 and an increase in sales volumes. ALKERAN(R) use in combination therapies for the treatment of hematological diseases continued to grow driven by clinical data reported at major medical conferences around the world. Also contributing to the increase in ALKERAN(R) sales volumes was the resolution of supply disruptions experienced in 2004, which resolution led to more consistent supplies of ALKERAN(R) for injection and consequently more consistent end market buying patterns. REVLIMID(R) was approved by the FDA on December 27, 2005 and the first commercial sales were recorded relating to initial stocking at certain contracted pharmacies that were registered under the RevAssist(R) program. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns, sales discounts, Medicaid rebates and distributor charge backs and service fees. Allowance for sales returns are based on the actual returns history for consumed lots and the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned. Sales discounts accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers. Medicaid rebate accruals are based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization. Distributor charge back accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally 43 qualified programs. Distributor services accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. See Critical Accounting Policies for further discussion. Gross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: Returns Distributor (IN THOUSANDS $) and Medicaid chargebacks allowances Discounts rebates and services Total Balance at December 31, 2003 $ 8,368 $ 657 $ 4,200 $ 889 $ 14,114 Allowances for sales during 2004 16,279 7,420 15,780 14,976 54,455 Allowances for sales during prior periods 28 28 Credits issued for prior year sales (6,221) (685) (2,880) (607) (10,393) Credits issued for sales during 2004 (8,826) (6,583) (11,566) (11,537) (38,512) Balance at December 31, 2004 $ 9,600 $ 837 $ 5,534 $ 3,721 $ 19,692 Allowances for sales during 2005 19,476 10,948 35,009 35,926 101,359 Allowances for sales during prior periods 1,780 89 1,869 Credits issued for prior year sales (11,380) (834) (5,623) (3,264) (21,101) Credits issued for sales during 2005 (14,459) (9,504) (14,049) (29,605) (67,617) Balance at December 31, 2005 $ 5,017 $ 1,447 $ 20,960 $ 6,778 $ 34,202 Allowances for sales during 2006 23,944 18,847 22,353 57,750 122,894 Allowances for sales during prior periods 30,607 34 30,641 Credits issued for prior year sales (35,624) (1,481) (20,357) (6,315) (63,777) Credits issued for sales during 2006 (14,464) (16,551) (15,488) (47,580) (94,083) Balance at December 31, 2006 $ 9,480 $ 2,296 $ 7,468 $ 10,633 $ 29,877 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: Sales returns allowances increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to unusually high THALOMID(R) returns from one specific large retail pharmacy chain, which occurred during the first half of 2006. The returns from this customer were the results of its efforts to more aggressively manage inventory, our package configuration which required pharmacies to purchase full cartons of up to ten sleeves of THALOMID(R) capsules with each order and S.T.E.P.S. (R) related restrictions, which limited the customers ability to transfer inventories between its locations. For the past several years, we have experienced sales returns of approximately 4% of sales. As a result of the higher returns activity during the first half of 2006, we recorded additional allowances to increase our reserve to approximately 9% of all estimated THALOMID(R) pharmacy inventories. In addition, we introduced single sleeve units, beginning June 7, 2006 (rather than requiring full carton purchases) and we amended our product returns policy to include a product returns handling fee. These measures have been designed to allow customers to more effectively manage their inventories, since they can now order smaller quantities, as well as limit our product returns exposure. Also, contributing to the increase in sales returns allowances, but to a lesser extent, were higher returns of expired ALKERAN(R) IV product. Sales discounts increased in 2006, compared to 2005, due to higher net sales. Medicaid rebate allowances decreased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to the impact of the new Medicare, Part D legislation, which became effective January 1, 2006. As a result of the new legislation many patients who had been eligible to receive THALOMID(R) through Medicaid coverage are now covered under Medicare, Part D. Partially offsetting the THALOMID(R) decrease are Medicaid rebate allowances included in 2006 for REVLIMID(R) sales. Distributor chargebacks increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to THALOMID(R) price increases, which increase the differential between annual contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare providers and our wholesale acquisition cost. Also contributing to the increase in distributor chargeback allowances was an increase in ALKERAN(R) IV sales to certain public health services, or PHS, contract eligible customers and an inclusion of accruals for REVLIMID(R) sales. 44 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Sales returns and sales discounts allowances increased in 2005, compared to 2004, primarily due to higher net sales. Medicaid rebate and distributor chargeback accruals increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to higher sales volumes and price increases. As a result of THALOMID(R) price increases, the Medicaid unit rebate amount for 2005 increased as a percentage of gross product sales, as compared to the accrual for 2004. As in the case of Medicaid rebate accruals, the THALOMID(R) price increases resulted in higher distributor chargeback accruals in 2005, as compared to 2004. OTHER REVENUES: 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources totaled $18.2 million in 2006, compared to $41.3 million in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to the inclusion in 2005 of a $20.0 million milestone payment received from Novartis relating to the FDA marketing approval for Focalin XR(TM). Royalty revenue totaled $69.1 million in 2006 and primarily consisted of $67.3 million received from Novartis on sales of their entire family of Ritalin(R) drugs and FOCALIN XR(TM). Royalty revenue was $50.0 million in 2005 and included $48.5 million from sales of Novartis Ritalin(R) family of drugs and FOCALIN XR(TM). Royalty revenues from Novartis increased primarily due to higher FOCALIN XR(TM) product sales. 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources totaled $41.3 million in 2005, compared to $20.0 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to a $20.0 million milestone payment from Novartis reflected in 2005 for the FOCALIN XR(TM) approval while, in 2004, we received a $7.5 million milestone payment related to the FOCALIN XR(TM) NDA submission. Also contributing to the increase were higher Pharmion collaboration related revenues in 2005. Royalty revenue totaled $50.0 million in 2005 and included $48.5 million from sales of Novartis Ritalin(R) family of drugs and FOCALIN XR(TM), which gained FDA approval on May 27, 2005. Royalty revenue was $26.9 million in 2004 and consisted primarily of royalties received from Novartis strictly on sales of their RITALIN(R) family of drugs. COST OF GOODS SOLD: Cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS $) 2006 2005 2004 Cost of goods sold $ 125,892 $ 80,727 $ 59,726 Increase from prior year $ 45,165 $ 21,001 $ 6,776 Percentage increase from prior year 55.9% 35.2% 12.8% Percentage of net product sales 15.5% 18.1% 18.1% 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: Cost of goods sold were higher in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to higher ALKERAN(R) costs. ALKERAN(R) costs tend to experience variability depending on the purchase price of the specific units sold during a given period. Also contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold were higher royalties on THALOMID(R) as a result of higher net sales and the inclusion of costs associated with REVLIMID(R) sales. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales were lower in 2006, compared to 2005 primarily due to the impact of REVLIMID(R) sales, which have a lower per unit cost than THALOMID(R), partially offset by higher ALKERAN(R) costs. 45 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Cost of goods sold were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to higher royalties on THALOMID(R) net sales and higher ALKERAN(R) costs as a result of higher sales volumes. As a percentage of net product sales, cost of goods sold in 2005 were in line with 2004. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: Research and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS $) 2006 2005 2004 Research and development expenses $ 258,621 $ 190,834 $ 160,852 Increase from prior year $ 67,787 $ 29,982 $ 38,152 Percentage increase from prior year 35.5% 18.6% 31.1% Percentage of total revenue 28.8% 35.5% 42.6% 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: Research and development expenses were higher in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to higher clinical research and development expenses, which among other things support multiple programs evaluating REVLIMID(R) and other IMiDs(R) across a broad range of hematological cancers, including multiple myeloma, MDS, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non Hodgkins lymphoma, myelofibrosis and hemoglobinopathies; higher medical information and education expenses, which support educating and training the medical community on hematological cancers such as multiple myeloma and MDS; and higher expenses to support ongoing development of other compounds such as CC 4047, CC 11006, CC 10004, CC 11050 as well as our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and placental derived stem cell program. Included in 2006 was share based compensation expense of $12.7 million resulting from the application of SFAS 123R, which became effective January 1, 2006. 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Research and development expenses were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to higher costs to support further clinical development and regulatory advancement of REVLIMID(R) Phase II and Phase III programs in myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma, including the ongoing pivotal Phase III MDS deletion 5q trial to support our MAA seeking approval to market REVLIMID(R) in Europe. Research and development expenses in 2006 consisted of $95.4 million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs; $109.1 million spent on other pharmaceutical programs, including toxicology, analytical research and development, drug discovery, quality and regulatory affairs; $40.8 million spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and $13.3 million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs. These expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for REVLIMID(R) and THALOMID(R), and for other compounds such as: CC 10004, our lead anti inflammatory compound that inhibits PDE 4, which results in the inhibition of multiple proinflammatory mediators such as TNF [alpha] and, which is currently being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; CC 4047, CC 11006 and CC 11050 which are currently either being evaluated in healthy volunteer Phase I clinical trials or for which Phase II clinical trials are planned or ongoing; and our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs as well as the placental stem cell program. In 2005, we spent $73.9 million on human pharmaceutical clinical programs; $69.1 million on other pharmaceutical programs; $36.9 million on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and $10.9 million on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs. In 2004, we spent $67.0 million on human pharmaceutical clinical programs; $44.7 million on other human pharmaceutical programs; $40.6 million on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs; and $8.6 million on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs. As total revenue increases, research and development expense may continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue, however the actual dollar amount may continue to increase as earlier stage compounds 46 are moved through the preclinical and clinical stages. Due to the significant risk factors and uncertainties inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects, the cost to complete such projects can vary. The data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay, limit or prevent a projects advancement through the various stages of clinical development, which would significantly impact the costs incurred to bring a project to completion. For information about the commercial and development status and target diseases of our drug compounds, refer to the product overview table contained in Part I, Item I of this Annual Report. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE: Selling, general and administrative expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS $) 2006 2005 2004 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 339,669 $ 181,796 $ 114,196 Increase from prior year $ 157,873 $ 67,600 $ 15,722 Percentage increase from prior year 86.8% 59.2% 16.0% Percentage of total revenue 37.8% 33.9% 30.3% 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher in 2006, compared to 2005 primarily due to $62.3 million of share based compensation expense resulting from the application of SFAS 123R, which became effective January 1, 2006, $63.8 million of higher commercial expenses related to REVLIMID(R) sales and marketing efforts in the United States, increased spending related to the build out of our international organization and contributions to independent non profit third party foundations and $30.5 million of higher general administrative expenses primarily related to personnel and professional and other outside service costs. 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to the inclusion in 2005 of approximately $40.0 million of REVLIMID(R) pre launch commercial expenses, such as global market research, marketing and educational programs and sales and marketing training and an increase of approximately $22.7 million in general administrative expenses resulting from higher professional and other miscellaneous outside service fees, higher personnel related expenses, higher facility related expenses and higher insurance costs, partially offset by lower THALOMID(R) and ALKERAN(R) related marketing expenses. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2005 was $2.5 million of expense related to accelerated depreciation of leasehold improvements at four New Jersey locations being consolidated into our new corporate headquarters. INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME, NET: Interest and investment income, net increased $15.8 million in 2006, compared to 2005. The increase was due to higher average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, an increase in net realized gains from the sale of certain marketable securities and higher short term interest rates. Included in 2006 and 2005 were other than temporary impairment losses on marketable securities available for sale of $3.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Interest and investment income, net decreased $3.8 million in 2005, compared to 2004 primarily due to the inclusion of the other than temporary impairment loss on marketable securities available for sale of $3.1 million in 2005. EQUITY IN LOSSES OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES: Under the equity method of accounting, we recorded losses of $8.2 million in 2006, which included $6.8 million for our share of EntreMed losses. In 2005, we recorded equity method losses of $6.9 million, which included $1.6 million for our share of EntreMed losses and a 47 charge of $4.4 million to write down the value of the EntreMed investment ascribed to in process research and development. INTEREST EXPENSE: Interest expense was $9.4 million, $9.5 million and $9.6 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and primarily reflects interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the $400 million convertible notes issued on June 3, 2003. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET: Other income (expense), net was $5.5 million of income in 2006 and included foreign exchange gains of $5.5 million. Other income (expense), net was $7.5 million of expense in 2005 and primarily consisted of unrealized losses of $6.9 million for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants. Other income (expense), net was $1.7 million of income in 2004 and primarily consisted of $3.6 million of foreign exchange and other miscellaneous net gains, partially offset by an unrealized loss of $1.9 million for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants. INCOME TAX PROVISION: The income tax provision for 2006 was $133.9 million and reflects tax expense impacted by certain expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions outside the United States for which we do not presently receive a tax benefit and nondeductible expenses which include share based compensation expense related to incentive stock options. The income tax provision for 2005 was $20.6 million and reflects tax expense impacted by certain expenses incurred outside the United States under an incentive tax holiday that expires in 2015 for which no tax benefit can be recorded. This was partially offset by the benefit from the elimination of valuation allowances totaling $42.6 million as of March 31, 2005, which was based on the fact that we determined it was more likely than not that certain benefits of our deferred tax assets would be realized. The income tax provision for 2004 was $10.4 million. NET INCOME: Net income and per common share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS) 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 68,981 $ 63,656 $ 52,756 Per common share amounts: Basic $ 0.20 $ 0.19 $ 0.16 Diluted $ 0.18(1) $ 0.18(1) $ 0.15 Weighted average shares: Basic 352,217 335,512 327,738 Diluted 407,181 390,585 345,710 Amounts have been adjusted for the two for one stock splits effected in February 2006 and October 2004. (1) In computing diluted earnings per share, the numerator has been adjusted to add back the after tax amount of interest expense recognized in the year on our convertible debt. 2006 COMPARED TO 2005: Net income was higher in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in total revenues partially offset by $76.6 million of share based compensation expense resulting from the application of SFAS 123R, which became effective January 1, 2006, inclusion in the 2005 period of the one time benefit of $42.6 million recognized from the elimination of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and higher operating expenses in 2006. 2005 COMPARED TO 2004: Net income and per common share amounts were higher in 2005, as compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in total revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses and other expenses recorded for changes in the estimated value of our investment in EntreMed, Inc. warrants, 48 other than temporary impairment write downs on available for sale securities and our share of equity losses of EntreMed, Inc. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: INCREASE (DECREASE) 2005 2004 TO TO (IN THOUSANDS $) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 83,561 $ 41,917 $ 155,939 $ 41,644 $ (114,022) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 6,784 $ (103,131) $ (92,636) $ 109,915 $ (10,495) Net cash provided by financing activities $1,221,246 $ 52,631 $ 16,002 $1,168,615 $ 36,629 OPERATING ACTIVITIES: Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to higher earnings, excluding the effects of certain non cash items including share based compensation expense totaling $76.6 million recorded in 2006 in connection with our application of SFAS 123R beginning January 1, 2006, and lower income taxes paid in 2006, partially offset by higher working capital levels associated with the growth of our business and SFAS 123R requirements to classify excess tax benefits (i.e., the tax benefit recognized upon exercise of stock options in excess of the benefit recognized from recognizing compensation cost for those options) as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows beginning in 2006. See working capital discussion below. INVESTING ACTIVITIES: Net cash provided by investing activities in 2006 included $77.8 million from net sales of available for sale marketable securities, partially offset by $46.1 million of capital expenditures; $12.4 million for the purchase of an API manufacturing facility from Siegfried Ltd.; $7.4 million for investments in affiliated companies and $5.1 million for an investment in other non marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2005 included $35.9 million of capital expenditures; $7.2 million for acquisition costs and working capital adjustments related to the October 2004 acquisition of Penn T; $49.5 million for net purchases of available for sale marketable securities; and $10.5 million from the exercise of warrants to purchase 7,000,000 shares of EntreMed common stock. Capital expenditures increased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to the construction of a drug product manufacturing facility at our Neuchatel, Switzerland site and expansion of our corporate headquarters in Summit, New Jersey. FINANCING ACTIVITIES: Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 included $1.006 billion from our November 2006 public offering wherein we issued an additional 20,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $51.60 per share. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires excess tax benefits (i.e., the tax benefit recognized upon exercise of stock options in excess of the benefit recognized from recognizing compensation cost for those options) to be classified as financing cash flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2006 was $113.1 million and the excess tax benefit recognized was $102.0 million. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2005 primarily reflects cash received from the exercise of employee stock options. 49 WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES: Working capital and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were as follows: INCREASE (DECREASE) 2005 TO (IN THOUSANDS $) 2006 2005 2006 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $1,982,220 $ 724,260 $1,257,960 Other current assets and current liabilities, net(1) 8,749 6,354 2,395 Net working capital $1,990,969 $ 730,614 $1,260,355 (1) Includes accounts receivable, net of allowances, inventory, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, income taxes payable and other current liabilities. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET: Accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2006 increased $49.9 million from December 31, 2005 as a result of higher net sales. Our days of sales outstanding, or DSO, as of December 31, 2006 improved by approximately nine days compared to December 31, 2005. The decrease in our DSO was primarily due to the collection of accounts receivables of certain large customers. INVENTORY: Inventory as of December 31, 2006 increased $5.1 million from December 31, 2005 primarily due to increases in THALOMID(R) and REVLIMID(R) inventories partially offset by a decrease in ALKERAN(R) inventory. REVLIMID(R) and THALOMID(R) inventories increased as a result of the introduction of new formulations and packaging configurations to support the products continued sales growth. ALKERAN(R) inventories tend to fluctuate depending on the purchase price of the specific units purchased during a given period. OTHER CURRENT ASSETS: Other current assets as of December 31, 2006 increased $50.3 million from December 31, 2005 primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses and in the amounts due from Novartis under the FOCALIN(R) license agreement. Prepaid expenses increased primarily due to inclusion of $31.6 million of prepaid taxes. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES: Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of December 31, 2006 increased $32.8 million from December 31, 2005 primarily due to increases in accruals for management incentives, distributor chargebacks and sales returns. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE: Income taxes payable increased $70.1 million during 2006 primarily from a current provision for income taxes of $189.4 million offset by a tax benefit on stock option exercises of $125.5 million. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES: We invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds and in highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. municipalities, corporations, and the U.S. government and its agencies. All investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt and equity securities at the time of purchase. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2006 was primarily due to $1.006 billion provided from our November 2006 public offering. 50 We expect to make substantial additional expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products. We expect increased research and product development costs, clinical trial costs, expenses associated with the regulatory approval process, international expansion costs and commercialization of product costs and capital investments. However, existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale, combined with cash received from expected net product sales and revenues from various research, collaboration and royalties agreements, are expected to provide sufficient capital resources to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD LESS THAN MORE THAN (IN MILLIONS $) 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 3 5 YEARS 5 YEARS TOTAL Convertible note obligations $ $399.9 $ $ $399.9 Operating leases 5.8 10.1 8.7 5.3 29.9 ALKERAN(R) supply agreements 29.1 38.2 67.3 Manufacturing facility note payable 3.4 6.7 6.7 16.4 33.2 Other contract commitments 24.2 6.7 30.9 $ 62.5 $461.6 $ 15.4 $ 21.7 $561.2 CONVERTIBLE DEBT: In June 2003, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured convertible notes. The convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi annually. The convertible notes can be converted at any time into 33,014,519 shares of common stock at a stock split adjusted conversion price of $12.1125 per share. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the carrying value of $400.0 million by $1.507 billion (for more information see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). OPERATING (FACILITIES) LEASES: We lease office and research facilities under various operating lease agreements in the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. At December 31, 2006, the non cancelable lease terms for the operating leases expire at various dates between 2007 and 2015 and include renewal options. In general, we are also required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs associated with the leases. For more information on the facilities that we occupy under lease arrangements that have remaining lease terms greater than one year see Part I, Item 2, "Properties." ALKERAN(R) PURCHASE COMMITMENT: In March 2003, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, to distribute, promote and sell ALKERAN(R) (melphalan), a therapy approved by the FDA for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary. Under the terms of the agreement, we purchase ALKERAN(R) tablets and ALKERAN(R) for infusion from GSK and distribute the products in the United States under the Celgene label. The agreement requires us to purchase certain minimum quantities each year under a take or pay arrangement. The agreement has been extended through March 31, 2009. On December 31, 2006, the remaining minimum purchase requirements under the agreement totaled $67.3 million. MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTE PAYABLE: In December 2006, we purchased an API manufacturing facility and certain other assets and liabilities from Siegfried located in Zofingen, Switzerland. The assets were purchased for a U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately $46.0 million, consisting of a payment of 51 approximately $12.4 million at the closing, $3.4 million payable in each of the first five following years and $3.3 million in each of the subsequent five years. The transaction included a technical service agreement which will allow us to retain the necessary support to operate the plant. At December 31, 2006, the remaining commitment based on year end exchange rates was a U.S. dollar equivalency of approximately $33.2 million of which payments totaling $16.4 million due over years 6 to 10 are forgiven if, pursuant to our right, we elect to sell the facility back to Siegfried during this period. OTHER CONTRACT COMMITMENTS: In connection with the acquisition of Penn T on October 21, 2004, we entered into a five year minimum period Technical Services Agreement with Penn Pharmaceutical Services Limited, or PPSL, and Penn Pharmaceutical Holding Limited under which PPSL provides the services and facilities necessary for the manufacture of THALOMID(R) and other thalidomide formulations. At December 31, 2006, the remaining cost to be incurred was approximately $6.7 million. In October 2006, we invested $1.4 million in Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III, a limited partnership. We have committed to investing an additional $18.6 million into the Fund over a ten year period, which is callable at any time. For more information see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. Other contract commitments at December 31, 2006 also includes $5.6 million of various contractual obligations. NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard, or SFAS, No. 109 and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. As the provisions of FIN 48 will be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption, the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year. This Interpretation is effective for us beginning January 1, 2007. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this Interpretation and do not believe it will have a material impact on our results of operations. However, we do expect to make certain balance sheet reclassifications to comply with FIN 48. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements", which establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Where applicable, this Statement simplifies and codifies related guidance within generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This accounting standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2008. We have not yet determined the effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 157 may have on the our consolidated financial statements. In February 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, "Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140," which permits a fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation. This accounting standard is effective for us beginning January 1, 2007. We have not yet determined the effect, if any, the adoption of FAS 155 may have on our financial position and results of operations. 52 In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements," or SAB 108, which provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior period misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 provides for the quantification of the impact of correcting all misstatements, including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements, on the current year financial statements. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 retroactive to January 1, 2006 and determined that it had no impact on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical: REVENUE RECOGNITION ON COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS: We have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies. These agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements. The agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments, milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events, and in some cases ongoing research funding. The agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives FDA marketing approval. Our revenue recognition policies for all nonrefundable upfront license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," as amended by SAB No. 104, "Revenue Recognition," or SAB 104. In addition, we follow the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00 21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," or EITF 00 21, for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after June 30, 2003. EITF 00 21 provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if this division is required, how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting. If the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the EITFs separation criteria, the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit. If the arrangement is a single unit of accounting, the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement. Under arrangements where the license fees and research and development activities can be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting, nonrefundable upfront license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our continued involvement in the research and development process. Revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones, if deemed substantive, are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved, and the milestone payments are due and collectible. Milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the milestone is nonrefundable; (2) achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement; (3) substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone; and, (4) the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended, the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions are not met, we would recognize a proportionate amount of the milestone payment upon 53 receipt as revenue that correlates to work already performed and the remaining portion of the milestone payment will be deferred and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations. GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS FOR SALES RETURNS, MEDICAID REBATES AND CHARGEBACKS: Our gross to net sales accruals for Sales Returns, Medicaid Rebates and Chargebacks are based on our sales. THALOMID(R) is distributed under our S.T.E.P.S.(R), or System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety, distribution program. Among other things, S.T.E.P.S.(R), which is a proprietary comprehensive education and risk management distribution program, requires prescribers, patients and dispensing pharmacies to participate in a registry and an order cannot be filled unless the physician, patient and pharmacy have all obtained an appropriate registration number. Automatic refills are not permitted under the program. Each prescription may not exceed a 28 day supply and a new prescription is required with each order. Although we invoice through traditional pharmaceutical wholesalers, all THALOMID(R) orders are drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy overnight. Wholesaler stocking of this product is prohibited. In addition, we do not offer commercial discounts on our products to pharmacies or hospitals and, therefore, have no commercial distributor chargebacks. Our chargebacks result from the difference between the wholesaler price and the lower federal ceiling price available to federally funded healthcare providers, such as Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Defense. REVLIMID(R) is distributed under the RevAssist(R) program, which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of REVLIMID(R), and is sold primarily through contracted pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel. SALES RETURNS: We record a sales returns allowance in the period the related product sale is recorded. We base the allowance, which primarily relates to THALOMID(R) sales returns, on actual returns history and known factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. We do not use information from external sources in estimating our product returns. As indicated above, THALOMID(R) is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and, as a result, wholesalers do not stock the product. In addition, since THALOMID(R) has a relatively long shelf life, typically two years, short dated inventory has not historically been an issue. REVLIMID(R) is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and thus, resulting in lower returns activity to date. The impact that external factors such as price changes from competitors and introductions of new and generic competing products could have on our sales returns accruals is highly judgmental and difficult to quantify. Our sales returns have not been impacted thus far by such external factors; however we continue to monitor such factors. Our sales returns allowances were $54.6 million, $21.3 million and $16.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which equates to an accrual rate of 5.7%, 3.9% and 4.2% of gross product sales in each of the three respective years. A 10% increase in our returns rate would have resulted in a $5.5 million decrease in our 2006 reported revenue. MEDICAID REBATES: The Medicaid rebate formula, which is established by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, provides for price increases based on increases in the Consumer Price Index All Urban Consumers, or CPI U. Price increases in excess of the allowable increase results in a higher unit 54 rebate amount, or URA. Our Medicaid rebate accruals are computed using the Medicaid URA, as determined under the Medicaid rebate formula, applied to the estimated Medicaid dispense quantities. Actual Medicaid dispense quantities are reported by individual states on a 45 60 day quarter end lag. Differences in Medicaid rebate accruals resulting from differences in the estimated Medicaid dispense quantities and actual Medicaid dispense quantities are adjusted in the following period. Medicaid rebate allowances decreased in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to the impact of the new Medicare, Part D legislation, which became effective January 1, 2006. As a result of the new legislation many patients who had been eligible to receive THALOMID(R) through Medicaid coverage during the prior year period are now covered under Medicare, Part D. Partially offsetting the THALOMID(R) decrease are Medicaid rebate allowances included in the current year period for REVLIMID(R) sales. DISTRIBUTOR CHARGEBACK: As indicated above, we do not offer commercial discounts on our products to pharmacies or hospitals and, therefore, have no commercial distributor chargebacks. Our distributor chargebacks result from the difference between the wholesaler price and the lower pricing available to federally funded healthcare providers, such as Veteran Affairs and the U.S. Department of Defense. We estimate distributor chargeback allowances at the time of sale based on the pharmacies to which the order was drop shipped and its eligibility for the lower pricing. Actual chargeback credits claimed by the wholesaler may significantly differ from our accruals. Distributor chargeback allowances relating to THALOMID(R) are more sensitive to price increases and will typically increase as result of differences between annual contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare providers and our current wholesale acquisition cost. On the other hand, REVLIMID(R) chargeback allowances are less sensitive to current wholesale acquisition cost price increases due to its relatively recent commercial launch date. OTHER GROSS TO NET SALES ACCRUALS: We record sales discounts accruals based on payment terms extended to customers and we record distributor services accruals based on contractual fees incurred for the wholesale distributor services provided. INCOME TAXES: We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our 2006 effective tax rate is approximately 66%. The effective tax rate exceeds the statutory tax rate primarily due to certain expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions outside the United States for which we do not presently receive a tax benefit and nondeductible expenses which include share based compensation expense related to incentive stock options. We operate under an incentive tax holiday in Switzerland that expires in 2015 and exempts us from certain Swiss taxes. Likewise, expenses currently being incurred there do not provide a tax benefit. To the extent we receive approvals in markets outside the United States, and manufacture and generate taxable income subject to our Swiss tax holiday, we would expect our effective tax rate to be lower in the future. At March 31, 2005, we determined it was more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets and as a result, eliminated certain deferred tax valuation allowances, which resulted in us recording an income tax benefit in 2005 of $42.6 million and an increase to additional paid in capital of $30.2 million. The decision to eliminate the deferred tax valuation allowances was based on an external Independent Data Monitoring Committees, or IDMC, analyses of two Phase III Special Protocol Assessment multiple myeloma trials and the conclusion that these trials exceeded the pre specified stopping rule. The IDMC found a statistically significant improvement in time to disease progression the primary endpoint of these Phase III trials in patients receiving REVLIMID(R) plus dexamethasone compared to patients receiving dexamethasone alone. This, 55 in concert with our nine consecutive quarters of profitability, led to the conclusion that it was more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. At December 31, 2006, it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. SHARE BASED COMPENSATION: We adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption date. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options. Management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the model. Fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized over the remaining service period after the adoption date (for additional information see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report). OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE FOR SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES: A decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security established. The determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment on our part and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment. Our marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities whose fair value is affected by interest rate and credit rating changes. The fair value of certain debt securities were negatively impacted by interest rate increases during 2006. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include: significant deterioration in the issuers earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the issuer, adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates, length of time that the fair value has been below our cost, our expected future cash flows from the security and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment. Assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions, which could differ from our assessment. During 2006 and 2005, we determined that certain securities had sustained other than temporary impairments and, as a result, we recognized impairment losses of $3.8 million and $3.1 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, which were recorded in interest and investment income, net. INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES: Our investment in EntreMed had a carrying value of $15.3 million and a fair value of $16.4 million at December 31, 2006. If the carrying value of our investment were to exceed its fair value, we would review it to determine whether an other than temporary decline in value of the investment has been sustained. If the investment is determined to have sustained an other than temporary decline in value, the investment will be written down to its fair value. Such an evaluation is 56 judgmental and dependent on the specific facts and circumstances. Factors that we considered in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include: the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis, the period of time that the market value is below cost, the financial condition of the investee and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment. We evaluate information that we are aware of in addition to quoted market prices, if any, in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists. ACCOUNTING FOR LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS: We have established a Long Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed to provide key officers and executives with performance based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre established corporate performance objectives covering a three year period. We currently have three 3 year performance cycles running concurrently ending December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009. The 2007 performance cycle was approved by the Management Compensation and Development Committee of the Board of Directors on February 2, 2007 and began on January 1, 2007 and will end on December 31, 2009. Performance measures for the Plans are based on the following components in the last year of the 3 year cycle: 25% on earnings per share, 25% on net income and 50% on revenue. Payouts may be in the range of 0% to 200% of the participants salary for the 2007, 2008 and 2009 Plans. The estimated payout for the concluded 2006 Plan is $4.5 million and the maximum potential payout, assuming objectives are achieved at the 200 % level for the 2007, 2008 and 2009 Plans, are $6.2 million, $6.4 million and $7.7 million, respectively. Such awards are payable in cash or, at our discretion, we can elect to pay the same value in our common stock based upon our stock price at the payout date. We accrue the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle. Prior to the end of a three year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award, or, if higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized expense related to the LTIP of $4.6 million, $4.4 million and $3.4 million, respectively. Accruals recorded for the LTIP entail making certain assumptions concerning future earnings per share, net income and revenues, the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used. Accruals for the LTIP are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts. In estimating the accruals management considers actual results to date for the performance period, expected results for the remainder of the performance period, operating trends, product development, pricing and competition. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. Market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments. The risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows or future earnings. We have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions. Although investments may be subject to credit risk, our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue, issuer or type of investment. At December 31, 2006, our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale, unsecured convertible notes issued by us and our notes payable to Siegfried. We may periodically utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. At December 57 31, 2006, we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding to sell U.S. dollars and buy British pounds for a notional amount of $12.1 million. The forward contract expires on March 30, 2007 and is an economic hedge of a U.S. dollar receivable of a U.K. foreign entity, which is remeasured through earnings each period based on changes in the spot rate. At December 31, 2006, the unrealized loss on the forward contract was immaterial. Assuming that the year end exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the British pound were to adversely change by a hypothetical ten percent, the change in the fair value of the contract would decrease by approximately $1.2 million. However, since the contract hedges a U.S. dollar receivable of a U.K foreign entity, any change in the fair value of the contract would be offset by a change in the underlying value of the hedged item. MARKETABLE SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE: At December 31, 2006, our marketable securities available for sale consisted of U.S. treasury securities, government sponsored agency securities, mortgage backed obligations, corporate debt securities, other asset backed securities and 1,939,598 shares of Pharmion Corporation common stock. Marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value, are held for an indefinite period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses, is included in interest and investment income, net. At the end of 2006, we determined that certain securities had sustained an other than temporary impairment due to a reduction in their future estimated cash flows and as a result, recognized a $3.8 million impairment loss, which was recorded in interest and investment income, net. As of December 31, 2006, the principal amounts, fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows: DURATION LESS THAN 1 1 TO 3 3 TO 5 5 TO 7 TOTAL (IN THOUSANDS $) YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS Principal amount $ 128,447 $95,295 $266,196 $17,400 $507,338 Fair value $ 128,453 $95,190 $253,121 $16,116 $492,880 Average interest rate 5.3% 5.0% 4.6% 1.2% 4.7% PHARMION COMMON STOCK: At December 31, 2006, we held a total of 1,939,598 shares of Pharmion Corporation common stock, which had an estimated fair value of approximately $49.9 million (based on the closing price reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, or NASDAQ system), and, which exceeded the cost by approximately $29.7 million. The amount by which the fair value exceeded the cost (i.e., the unrealized gain) was included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Stockholders Equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of the Pharmion common stock investment is subject to market price volatility and any increase or decrease in Pharmions common stock quoted market price will have a similar percentage increase or decrease in the fair value of our investment. CONVERTIBLE DEBT: In June 2003, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million of unsecured convertible notes. The convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of 1.75% payable semi annually. The convertible notes can be converted at any time into 33,014,519 shares of common stock at a stock split adjusted conversion price of $12.1125 per share (for more information see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the carrying value of $399.9 million by approximately $1.5 billion, which we believe reflects the increase in the market price of our common stock to $57.53 per share as of December 31, 58 2006. Assuming other factors are held constant, an increase in interest rates generally results in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate convertible debt, but does not impact the carrying value, and an increase in our stock price generally results in an increase in the fair value of convertible debt, but does not impact the carrying value. NOTE PAYABLE: At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our note payable to Siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note of $25.9 million due to the short period of time since we issued it. Assuming other factors are held constant, an increase in interest rates generally will result in a decrease in the fair value of the note. The fair value of the note will also be effected by changes in the U.S. dollar/Swiss franc exchange rate. The note is denominated in Swiss francs. 59
