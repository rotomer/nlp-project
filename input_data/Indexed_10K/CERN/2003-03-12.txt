Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction In 2002, the Company set records in bookings, revenues, pro forma earnings and cash flow for the third consecutive year. The Company continued to expand the breadth of its applications, offering nearly 50 different information technology solutions at the end of 2002. The strength of the Companys application breadth is evidenced in record bookings contributions from ten different major application categories in 2002. The Company continued to build new client relationships and expand market share in 2002, with approximately 40 percent of new business bookings coming from clients that had no prior relationship with the Company. The Company also continued to strengthen its strategic presence in Europe. Operationally, the Company brought more than 500 Cerner Millennium applications live in 2002, bringing the total number of live applications to more than 1,700. The Company continued to increase its presence in new markets in 2002. During 2002, the Company made good progress at implementing its new patient accounting solution, ProFit, and now has over 10 sites live. Cerner ProVision, the Companys enterprise wide image management solution that was launched in 2001, was brought live by four clients and sold to another 12 during 2002. The Company also expanded its managed services business and now has over 80 clients relying on its data center for hosting of technology services. Health care organizations remain under significant pressures to improve the quality of care and eliminate variance and waste. Several parties, including the government, employer groups and consumer organizations, are demanding heightened efforts to eliminate medical error and reduce the costs of health care delivery. The Institute of Medicine has issued three major reports since 1999 that identify preventable medical errors as a major cause of death in the United States and suggest implementing information technology as a key part of the solution to preventing these unnecessary deaths. The Leapfrog Group, a consortium of large employers, continues to call for systemic change in the health care industry, and is a major proponent of requiring deployment of computerized physician order entry systems to reduce medical errors. The industry is also facing significant clinician shortages, particularly in nursing, radiology and pharmacy. The aging Baby Boomers, whose average age will be 65 years old in 2010, are expected to put added pressure on the health care system as their need for care increases. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) adds an additional element of complexity for health care organizations around security and patient confidentiality. The Company believes most of the issues faced by health care organizations today can be effectively addressed with information technology. And the Company believes that its investment in the Cerner Millennium architecture creates a major competitive advantage. Cerner Millennium is a fully integrated, large scale, contemporary, enterprise wide architecture. This unification and the breadth of the Companys solutions position the Company very well to help health care organizations address the critical issues they face today. Results of Operations Year Ended December 28, 2002, Compared to Year Ended December 29, 2001 The Companys revenues increased 39% to $751,852,000 in 2002 from $542,423,000 in 2001. The Company had net earnings of $48,022,000 in 2002 compared to a net loss of $42,366,000 in 2001. Net earnings, before special charges and credits, were $51,825,000 in 2002 compared to $34,217,000 in 2001. Operating results for 2002, as described below, included a gain on the sale of available for sale securities and a charge for the impairment of investments, and a change in accounting principle for goodwill. Operating results for 2001, as described below, included a gain on software license settlement and investment losses. Revenues In 2002, revenues increased due to an increase in system sales, support of installed systems and an increase in services. System sales increased 36% to $332,274,000 in 2002 from $244,979,000 in 2001. Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software. The increase in system sales is due to an increase in new contract bookings in 2002 compared to 2001. 21 Table of Contents Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 41% to $419,578,000 in 2002 from $297,444,000 in 2001. Support and maintenance revenues were $171,238,000 and $140,666,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Services revenues were $248,340,000 and $156,778,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware, and professional services, excluding installation. This increase was due primarily to the increase in professional services, resulting from an increase in services related to and services provided into the Companys installed and converted client base. At December 28, 2002, the Company had $732,719,000 in contract backlog and $269,153,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $566,280,000 in contract backlog and $221,393,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2001. Cost of Revenues The cost of revenues includes the cost of third party consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 22% of total revenues in 2002, and 21% of total revenues in 2001. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The increase in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from an increase in the percent of revenue from computer hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of revenue percentage. Sales and Client Service Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 42% in both 2002 and 2001. The increase in total sales and client service expenses is attributable to the cost of a larger field sales and services organization and marketing of new solutions. Software Development Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2002 and 2001 were $149,985,000 and $113,872,000, respectively. These amounts exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $49,984,000 and $37,828,000 for 2002 and 2001, respectively. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses and professional fees. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% in both 2002 and 2001. Interest Expense, Net Interest income was $1,080,000 in 2002 compared to $2,896,000 in 2001. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in interest rates and average invested cash. Interest expense was $6,635,000 in 2002 compared to $7,321,000 in 2001, primarily as a result of lower borrowing levels during the year. Other Income, Net Other income decreased to $87,000 in 2002 from $182,000 in 2002. Included in other revenues are revenues from office space leased to third parties. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Investment In December 2002, the Company exercised 1,048,783 warrants of WebMD with an exercise price of $3.08 and a cost basis and carrying value of $4,146,000. The warrants were scheduled to expire on January 26, 2003. In December 2002, the Company sold 1,048,783 shares of WebMD for $8,242,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of $527,000, net of $342,000 in tax, as a result of the exercise of the warrants and the sale of the shares. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company sold 14,820,527 shares of WebMD for $90,119,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of $2,736,000, net of $1,572,000 in tax, as a result of the sale. 22 Table of Contents Impairment of Investment The Companys policy is to review declines in fair value of its marketable equity securities for declines that may be other than temporary. Based on events occurring in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $6,281,000, net of tax of $3,623,000, for the impairment of various investments in non publicly traded securities. The charge is primarily related to a $3,464,000, net of tax, write down of the Companys investment in Protocare, Inc, a non publicly traded company. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a write down of its investment in WebMD from $15.00 to $5.79. Accordingly, the Company recognized a charge to earnings of $81,419,000, net of $46,197,000 in tax. Gain on Software License Settlement On June 18, 2001, the Company reached an agreement with WebMD Corporation regarding certain performance metrics related to specified levels of physician usage arising out of the original license transaction between the Company and WebMD. Under the agreement, the Company received 2,000,000 shares of WebMD stock, valued at $11,580,000, in exchange for $432,000 in cash and the cancellation of various obligations due to the Company by WebMD. As a result of this agreement, the Company recognized a gain of $4,836,000, net of $2,744,000 in tax. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate was an expense of 39% in 2002 and a benefit of 33% in 2001. The benefit is a result of the loss on the WebMD shares and other permanent differences. Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company completed its transitional review of the Companys goodwill values in the second quarter of 2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units. Year Ended December 29, 2001, Compared to Year Ended December 30, 2000 The Companys revenues increased 35% to $542,423,000 in 2001 from $400,824,000 in 2000. The Company had a net loss of $42,366,000 in 2001 compared to net earnings of $105,265,000 in 2000. Net earnings, before special charges and credits were $34,217,000 in 2001 compared to $20,366,000 in 2000. Operating Results for 2001, as described below, included a gain on software license settlement and investment losses. Operating results for 2000, as described below, included a realized investment gain and loss, write offs of acquired in process research and development and a write down of intangible assets. Revenues In 2001, revenues increased due to an increase in system sales and support of installed systems. System sales increased 37% to $244,979,000 in 2001 from $179,173,000 in 2000. Included in system sale are revenues from the sale of software, hardware, sublicensed software and professional services. The increase in system sales is due to an increase in new contract bookings in 2001 compared to 2000. Support and maintenance and service revenues increased 34% in 2001 compared to 2000. Support and maintenance revenues were $140,666,000 and $114,896,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Service revenues were $156,778,000 and $106,755,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware, and professional services, excluding installation. This increase was due primarily to the increase in professional services, resulting from an increase in services related to and services provided into the Companys installed and converted client base. 23 Table of Contents At December 29, 2001, the Company had $566,280,000 in contract backlog and $221,393,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $439,943,000 in contract backlog and $184,360,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2000.

It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 21% of total revenues in 2001, and 22% of total revenues in 2000. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from a decrease in the percent of revenue from computer hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of revenue percentage. Sales and Client Service Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 42% in both 2001 and 2000. The increase in total sales and client service expenses is attributable to the cost of a larger field sales and services organization and marketing of new software solutions. Software Development Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2001 and 2000 were $113,872,000 and $90,694,000, respectively.

Interest Expense, Net Interest income was $2,896,000 in 2001 compared to $3,645,000 in 2000. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in invested cash. Interest expense was $7,321,000 in 2001 compared to $7,316,000 in 2000. Other Income, Net Other revenues decreased to $182,000 in 2001 from $3,669,000 in 2000. Included in other revenues are revenues from office space leased to third parties and other investment revenues. This decrease was due to a decrease in other investment revenue. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Investment On December 12, 2000, the Company sold 4,273,509 shares of WebMD for $25,641,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment loss of $24,539,000, net of $13,923,000 of tax, as a result of the sale. Impairment of Investment The Companys policy is to review declines in fair value of its marketable equity securities for declines that may be other than temporary. As a result of that policy, during the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a write down of its investment in WebMD from $15.00 to $5.79. Accordingly, the Company recognized a charge to earnings of $81,419,000, net of $46,197,000 in tax. 24 Table of Contents Gain on Software License Settlement On June 18, 2001, the Company reached an agreement with WebMD Corporation regarding certain performance metrics related to specified levels of physician usage arising out of the original license transaction between the Company and WebMD. Under the agreement, the Company received 2,000,000 shares of WebMD stock, valued at $11,580,000, in exchange for $432,000 in cash and the cancellation of various obligations due to the Company by WebMD. As a result of this agreement, the Company recognized a gain of $4,836,000, net of $2,744,000 of tax. Realized Gain on Exchange of Stock On February 13, 2000, CareInsite entered into an agreement to merge with WebMD. The merger of CareInsite and WebMD (Merger) closed on September 12, 2000. Prior to the Merger, the carrying value of the CareInsite stock was $6.22 per share, the market price of WebMD on September 12, 2000 was $15.00 per share. Upon the exchange of CareInsite stock for WebMD stock, the Company recorded an investment gain of $120,362,000, net of $68,292,000 of tax, as a result of the exchange. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate was a benefit of 33% in 2001 and an expense of 39% in 2000. The benefit is a result of the loss on the WebMD shares and other permanent differences. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company had total cash and cash equivalents of $142,543,000 at the end of 2002 and working capital of $282,135,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $107,536,000 at the end of 2001 and working capital of $189,488,000. The Company generated cash of $36,850,000, $64,838,000 and $53,313,000 from operations in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash flow from operations decreased in 2002 due primarily to a $31,200,000 tax payment related to the sale of shares of WebMD. Cash flow from operations increased in 2001 and 2000, due primarily to the increase in net earnings before noncash charges, increased collection of receivables, improved payment terms and record level of conversions. Cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capitalized software development costs of $49,984,000 and $37,828,000 and purchases of capital equipment, land and buildings of $59,699,000 and $25,722,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company also completed acquisitions of businesses for $26,016,000 and $4,045,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company had proceeds of $95,134,000 from the sale of shares of WebMD in 2002. Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements represent recurring cash flows. Support and maintenance revenues increased 22% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, and the Company expects these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed systems grows. On December 20, 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement dated December 15, 2002. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in three equal annual installments beginning in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a $39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual installments beginning December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the bank loan agreement and will be used for general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 28, 2002. The Companys liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of the Companys revenues, its cash collections from its clients and the amounts the Company invests in software development, acquisitions and capital expenditures. The Company has a loan agreement with a bank that provides for a current revolving line of credit for working capital purposes. In June 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks led by U.S. Bank. The new credit facility increased the amount the Company may borrow from $45,000,000 to $90,000,000. The fee rate on the new facility is approximately the same as the prior facility. The revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of interest only. Interest is payable at the Companys option at a rate based on prime (4.25% at December 28, 2002) or LIBOR 25 Table of Contents (1.42% at December 28, 2002) plus 2%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1% if certain net worth ratios are maintained. At December 28, 2002, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. The agreement contains certain net worth, current ratio and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. A commitment fee of 1/2% or 3/10% is payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit matures on May 31, 2005. The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during 2003. On April 15, 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement dated April 1, 1999. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, are payable in five equal annual installments beginning in April 2002. The Series B Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual installments beginning April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire the Companys existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds will be used for capital improvements and to strengthen the Companys cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 28, 2002. At December 28, 2002, the Company was committed to spending approximately $63,000,000 under construction contracts for two new buildings at its North Kansas City headquarters complex. At December 28, 2002, the Company had spent $26,464,000. The construction will be financed by the Companys cash position, cash generated from operations and if necessary the line of credit. The following table represents a summary of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 28, 2002, except those arising in the ordinary course. Payments due by period 2008 and Obligations (in thousands) 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 thereafter Total Long Term Debt Obligations 12,202 19,302 18,667 25,667 13,667 59,333 148,838 Lease Obligations 10,781 6,052 1,264 425 18,522 Acquisition Related Commitments 1,499 7,500 8,999 Supplier Software Purchase Commitments (1) 1,150 1,150 Building Commitments (2) 36,536 36,536 Total 60,669 26,853 19,931 26,092 21,167 59,333 214,045 (1) Excludes purchase obligations for which Cerner has a client commitment. (2) The Company has the right to terminate the underlying construction contracts and the related future commitments under such contracts but has no plans or intentions of stopping construction. The effects of inflation on the Companys business during 2002, 2001 and 2000 were not significant. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143). The Company is required to adopt SFAS 143 effective December 28, 2002. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146). SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 143 or 146 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these accounting standards. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the Companys historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue 26 Table of Contents and other significant areas involving managements judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development, other than temporary declines in the market value of investments, allowance for doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill. These policies and the Companys procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within the Discussion and Analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Note 1 to the accompanying financial statements further expands upon the Companys accounting policies. Revenue Recognition Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical financial and administrative information systems and solutions. The components of the system sales revenues are the licensing of computer software, installation, subscription content and the sale of computer hardware and sublicensed software. The components of support, maintenance and service revenues are software support and hardware maintenance, remote hosting and outsourcing, training, consulting and implementation services. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 4, SOP 98 9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SOP No 97 2, as amended, generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements. Revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when Company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement (i.e. professional services, software support, hardware maintenance, hardware and sublicensed software), but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement (i.e. software solutions). The Company allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the elements respective fair value, with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately. Specifically, the Company determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the renewal price of the maintenance charged to clients, professional services portion of the arrangement, other than installation services, based on hourly rates which the Company charges for these services when sold apart from a software license, and the hardware and sublicensed software based on the prices for these elements when they are sold separately from the software. If evidence of the fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement, the entire amount of revenue under the arrangement is deferred until these elements have been delivered or objective evidence can be established. Inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management estimates and judgments, which influence the timing and the amount of revenue recognition. The Company provides several models for the procurement of its clinical, financial and administrative information systems. The predominant method is a perpetual software license agreement, project related installation services, implementation and consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed software and software support. For those arrangements involving the use of services, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting, following the guidance in the AICPA Statement of Position No. 81 1 (SOP 81 1), Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts. The Company provides installation services, which include project scoping services, conducting pre installation audits and creating initial environments. Because installation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software, software license and installation services fees are recognized over the software installation period using output measures which reflect direct labor hours incurred, beginning at software delivery and culminating at completion of installation, typically a three to six month process. The Company also provides implementation and consulting services, which include consulting activities that fall outside of the scope of the standard installation services. These services vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the client. Examples of such services may include additional database consulting, system configuration, project management, testing assistance, network consulting and post conversion review services. Implementation and consulting services generally are not deemed 27 Table of Contents to be essential to the functionality of the software, and thus do not impact the timing of the software license recognition, unless software license fees are tied to implementation milestones. In those instances, the portion of the software license fee tied to implementation milestones is deferred until the related milestone is accomplished and related fees become billable and non forfeitable. Implementation fees are recognized over the service period, which may extend from six months to three years. Remote hosting and outsourcing services are marketed under long term arrangements generally over periods of five to 10 years. Revenues from these arrangements are recognized as the services are performed. Software maintenance fees are marketed under annual and multi year arrangements and are recognized as revenue ratably over the contracted maintenance term. Hardware maintenance revenues are billed and recognized monthly over the contracted maintenance term. Subscription and content fees are generally marketed under annual and multi year agreements and are recognized ratably over the contracted terms. Hardware and sublicensed software sales are generally recognized upon delivery to the client. The Company also offers its solutions on an application service provider (ASP) or a term license basis, making available Company software functionality on a remote processing basis from the Companys data centers. The data centers provide system and administrative support as well as processing services. Revenue on software and services provided on an ASP or term license basis is recognized on a monthly basis over the term of the contract. The Company capitalizes related direct costs consisting of third party costs and direct software installation and implementation costs. These costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement. In limited cases where the Company has contractually agreed to develop new or customized software code for a client, the Company utilizes percentage of completion accounting in accordance with SOP 81 1. Deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for license fees, maintenance and other services for which payment has been received and for which the service has not yet been performed. Long term deferred revenue, at December 29, 2001, represents amounts received from license fees, maintenance and other services to be earned or provided beginning in periods on or after December 29, 2002. Software Development Costs Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected future revenue for each software solutions with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators, internet based start up companies and others specializing in the health care industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the health care information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment. Investments The Company accounts for its investments in equity securities, which have readily determinable fair values as available for sale. Available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 28 Table of Contents For realized gains and losses on available for sale investments, the Company utilizes the specific identification method as the basis to determine cost. Investments in the common stock of certain affiliates over which the Company exerts significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. The Company has certain other minority equity investments in non publicly traded securities. These investments are generally carried at cost as the Company owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. The balance of these investments at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was $876,000 and $18,212,000, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the market for technologies and content by these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be significant. The Company could lose its entire investment in certain or all of these companies. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary. The Company reviews all equity securities for declines in fair value. If such declines are considered to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis, and the amount of the write down is included in earnings Concentrations Substantially all of the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, are held at three major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of the Companys cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. Substantially all of the Companys clients are integrated delivery networks, hospitals and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Companys access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future results. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients and generally does not require collateral from its clients. The Company maintains an allowance for potential losses on a specific identification basis and based on historical experience and managements judgments. Goodwill Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company completed its review of the Companys goodwill values in the second quarter of 2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units. The Company completed three acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001, which resulted in approximately, $36.7 million of goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with SFAS 142. For the years ended 2001 and 2000, earnings included $1,758,000 and $1,015,000 of amortization of goodwill, net of tax, respectively. Goodwill amounted to $45,938,000 and $23,879,000 at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001, respectively. 29 Table of Contents Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations, Financial Condition or Business Statements made in this report, the Annual Report to Shareholders in which this report is made a part, other reports and proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, communications to shareholders, press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the Company that are not historical in nature, or that state the Companys or managements intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology, such as could, should, will, will be, will lead, will assist, intended, continue, believe, may, expect, hope, anticipate, goal, forecast, plan, or estimate or variations thereof or similar expressions. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. It is important to note that any such performance and actual results, financial condition or business, could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unforeseen factors not identified herein could also have such an effect. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results, financial condition or business over time. Quarterly Operating Results May Vary The Companys quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods. Quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes mandated by regulating entities (including, but not limited to, any accounting policy change concerning the expensing of options), demand for the Companys software solutions and services, the Companys long sales cycle, potentially long installation and implementation cycle for these larger, more complex and costlier systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report. As a result of health care industry trends and the market for the Companys Cerner Millennium solutions, a large percentage of the Companys revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger, more complex and costlier systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client. The sale may be subject to delays due to clients internal budgets and procedures for approving large capital expenditures and by competing needs for other capital expenditures and deploying new technologies or personnel resources. Delays in the expected sale or installation of these large contracts may have a significant impact on the Companys anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently its earnings, since a significant percentage of the Companys expenses are relatively fixed. These larger, more complex and costlier systems are installed and implemented over time periods ranging from approximately one month to three years and may involve significant efforts both by the Company and the client. The Company recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon the Companys and the clients ability to meet these project milestones. Delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract relating to one or more of these systems could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter. In addition, support payments by clients for the Companys solutions generally do not commence until the solution is in use. The Companys revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year, primarily as a result of the clients year end efforts to make all final capital expenditures for the current year. Stock Price May Be Volatile The trading price of the Companys common stock may be volatile. The market for the Companys common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results, rumors about the Companys performance or software solutions, changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, health care reform measures, client relationship developments, changes occurring in the securities 30 Table of Contents markets in general and other factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. As a matter of policy, the Company does not generally comment on rumors. Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software, health care and high technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Companys common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. Market Risk of Investments The Company accounts for its investments in equity securities, which have readily determinable fair values as available for sale. Available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in the common stock of certain affiliates over which the Company exerts significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in other equity securities are reported at cost. The Company reviews all equity securities for declines in fair value. If such declines are considered to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis, and the amount of the write down is included in earnings. The Company also has certain other minority equity investments in non publicly traded securities. These investments are generally carried at cost as the Company owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. The carrying value of these investments at December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 was $876,000 and $18,212,000, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the market for technologies and content by these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be significant. The Company could lose its entire investment in certain or all of these companies. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary. At December 28, 2002, marketable securities (which consist of money market and commercial paper) of the Company were recorded at cost, which approximates fair value of approximately $143 million, with an overall average return of approximately 2.3% and an overall weighted maturity of less than 90 days. The marketable securities held by the Company are not subject to significant price risk as a result of the short term nature of the investments. The Company has limited exposure to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt since substantially all of its long term debt is at a fixed rate. The Company also had no borrowings outstanding under its working capital line of credit, which has a variable interest rate based on prime (4.25% at December 28, 2002) or LIBOR (1.42% at December 28, 2002) plus 2%. To date, the Company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The Company conducts business in several foreign jurisdictions. However, the business transacted is in the local functional currency and the Company does not currently have any material exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses. All other business transactions are in U.S. dollars. To date, the Company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk. Changes in the Health Care Industry The health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. For example, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105 32) contains significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid and began to have its initial impact in 1998 due to limitations on reimbursement, resulting cost containment initiatives, and effects on pricing and demand for capital intensive systems. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) will have a direct impact on the health care industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions/code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the protection of patient health information. These factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of health care organizations. Federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the U.S. health care system at both the federal and state level and to change health care financing and reimbursement systems. These programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in health care, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which health care industry participants operate. Health care industry participants may 31 Table of Contents respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in the Companys software solutions and services. Many health care providers are consolidating to create integrated health care delivery systems with greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for the Companys software solutions and services. As the health care industry consolidates, the Companys client base could be eroded, competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of acquiring each client becomes greater. Significant Competition The market for health care information systems is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings, the stability of the information systems provider, the features and capabilities of the information systems, the ongoing support for the system and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions. Certain of the Companys competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than the Company and some of its competitors offer software solutions that it does not offer. The Companys principal existing competitors include GE Medical Systems, Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corporation, IDX Systems Corporation, McKesson Corporation, Eclipsys Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc. (Meditech) and Epic Systems Corporation, each of which offers a suite of software solutions that compete with many of the Companys software solutions and services. There are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing software solutions. In addition, the Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators, internet based start up companies and others specializing in the health care industry may offer competitive software/solutions or services. The pace of change in the health care information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new software solution introductions, software solution enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the Companys success will depend upon its ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce, on a timely and cost effective basis, new and enhanced software solutions and services that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance. Proprietary Technology May Be Subjected to Infringement Claims or May Be Infringed Upon The Company relies upon a combination of license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of its proprietary information. The Company also relies on trademark and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property. The Company has initiated a patent program but currently has a very limited patent portfolio. As a result, the Company may not be able to protect against misappropriation of its intellectual property. In addition, the Company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of its software solutions and services overlaps with competitive offerings. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend. If the Company becomes liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, it could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the software solutions that contain the infringing intellectual property. Government Regulation The United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) has declared that software products intended for the maintenance of data used in making decisions regarding the suitability of blood donors and the release of blood or blood components for transfusion are medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Act) and amendments to the Act. As a consequence, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA with regard to its blood bank software. If other of the Companys software solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the FDA, the Company could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing requirements including pre market notification clearance prior to marketing. Complying with these FDA regulations 32 Table of Contents would be time consuming and expensive. It is possible that the FDA may become more active in regulating computer software that is used in health care. Following an inspection by the FDA in March of 1998, the Company received a Form FDA 483 (Notice of Inspectional Observations) alleging non compliance with certain aspects of FDAs Quality System Regulation with respect to the Companys PathNet HNAC Blood Bank Transfusion and Donor products (the Blood Bank Products). The Company subsequently received a Warning Letter, dated April 29, 1998, as a result of the same inspection. The Company responded promptly to the FDA and undertook a number of actions in response to the Form 483 and Warning Letter including an audit by a third party of the Companys Blood Bank Products and improvements to Cerners Quality System. A copy of the third party audit was submitted to the FDA in October of 1998 and, at the request of the FDA, additional information and clarification were submitted to the FDA in January of 1999. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys actions taken in response to the Form 483 and Warning Letter will be deemed adequate by the FDA or that additional actions on behalf of the Company will not be required. In addition, the Company remains subject to periodic FDA inspections and there can be no assurances that the Company will not be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure by the Company to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Companys ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its software solutions. The FDA has many enforcement tools including recalls, seizures, injunctions, civil fines and or criminal prosecutions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition. Product Related Liabilities Many of the Companys software solutions provide data for use by health care providers in providing care to patients. Although no such claims have been brought against the Company to date regarding injuries related to the use of its software solutions, such claims may be made in the future. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it believes is sufficient for its business, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought in the future, prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful claim brought against the Company, which is uninsured, or under insured could materially harm its business, results of operations or financial condition. System Errors and Warranties The Companys systems, particularly the Cerner Millennium versions, are very complex. As with complex systems offered by others, the Companys systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced. Although the Company conducts extensive testing, it has discovered software errors in its software solutions after their introduction. The Companys systems are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Therefore, users of the Company software solutions have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally. The Companys agreements with its clients typically provide warranties against material errors and other matters. Failure of a clients system to meet these criteria could constitute a material breach under such contracts allowing the client to cancel the contract and obtain a refund and or damages, or could require the Company to incur additional expense in order to make the system meet these criteria. The Companys contracts with its clients generally limit the Companys liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions or circumstances. Anti Takeover Defenses The Companys charter, bylaws, shareholders rights plan and certain provisions of Delaware law contain certain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company. Such provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the Company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the Board of Directors in connection with any such transaction. These provisions include (a) a Board of Directors that is staggered into three classes to serve staggered three year terms, (b) blank check preferred stock, (c) supermajority voting provisions, (d) inability of shareholders to act by written consent or call a special meeting, (e) limitations on the ability of shareholders to nominate directors or make proposals at shareholder meetings and (f) triggering the exercisability of stock purchase rights on a discriminatory basis, which may invoke extensive economic and voting dilution of a potential acquirer if its beneficial ownership of the Companys 33 Table of Contents common stock exceeds a specified threshold. Certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of the Company not approved by the Board of Directors in which shareholders might receive a premium value for their shares. Risks Associated with the Companys Global Operations The Company markets, sells and services its software solutions globally. The Company has established offices around the world, including in North America, Europe and in the Asia Pacific region. The Company will continue to expand its global operations and enter new global markets. This expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect global sales and support channels. In some countries, the Companys success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. There is a risk that the Company may sometimes choose the wrong partner. For these reasons, the Company may not be able to maintain or increase global market demand for its software solutions. Global operations are subject to inherent risks, and the Companys future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include: Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods; Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; The impact of economic conditions outside the United States; Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; Certification requirements; Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; Potentially adverse tax consequences; Political instability; Trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements; Service provider and government spending patterns; Natural disasters, war or terrorist acts; Poor selection of a partner in a country; and Political conditions which may threaten the safety of associates or the continued presence of the Company in these countries.
