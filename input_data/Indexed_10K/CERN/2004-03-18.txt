Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Cerner Corporation (Cerner or the Company) is headquartered in North Kansas City, Missouri. Cerner derives revenue by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions and hardware that gives healthcare providers secure access to clinical, administrative and financial data in real time, allowing them to improve the quality, safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. Cerner implements these solutions as stand alone, combined or enterprise wide systems. Cerner solutions can be managed by its clients or in Cerners data center via a managed services model. Results Overview Cerner had a strong finish to 2003 after a slow start that was caused by a lower than expected level of new business bookings in the first quarter of the year. New business bookings reflect the value of contracts for software, hardware, services and managed services (hosting of software in Cerners data center). The new business bookings shortfall in the first quarter was approximately $50 million, and it resulted in lower than expected revenue and earnings for the first quarter and full year because some of these bookings would have been reflected as first quarter revenue and much of the remainder would have been included in subsequent quarters. Reflecting on the first quarter bookings shortfall, management does not believe that it reflected a fundamental change in the demand for the Companys solutions and services. This assessment is supported by the fact that, after recording first quarter bookings of $151,000,000, the Company averaged $220,000,000 of bookings in each of the three remaining quarters of 2003. For the full year, the Company continued to gain market share in the healthcare information technology industry, with approximately 40% of its new business contract bookings coming from clients that had no prior relationship with the Company. Total new business bookings, which includes contract bookings, enhancement bookings and additional service bookings, were $811,200,000 in 2003, an increase of 10% compared to $735,600,000 in 2002. Total revenues increased 8% in 2003 to $839,587,000, with the majority of the increase driven by increased support, maintenance and services revenue. System sales revenues, which include software, hardware and sublicensed software, were basically flat. System sales revenues did not increase as much as management had expected because of the aforementioned first quarter bookings shortfall and because of a shift in the mix of bookings during the year. The booking mix shift was driven by stronger demand for managed services and subscription offerings, which are recognized as revenue over a longer period of time than other types of bookings. Managed service and subscription bookings accounted for more than 20% of total bookings in 2003 compared to about 15% in 2002. The mix shift in bookings is also reflected in the Companys contract backlog growth. In 2003, the Companys contract backlog, which contains bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue, grew 28% to $938,221,000 compared to total revenue growth of 8%, indicating that the Company still created strong levels of new business, but that this new business will be recognized as revenue over a longer period of time. Net earnings for the year declined from $48,022,000 to $42,791,000. This decline was driven largely by the lower level of first quarter bookings and resulting lower level of revenue despite an increased level of spending in anticipation of supporting higher top line growth. By the end of the year, the impact of the first quarter was mostly complete, with fourth quarter 2003 operating margins at 12.7 %, which was in line with the level they were in the fourth quarter of 2002. Going forward, management believes the Company can expand operating margins from current levels by expanding margins on services, leveraging investments in research and development, and controlling sales, general and administrative spending. Operationally, the Company had an outstanding year in 2003. The Company brought nearly 900 Cerner Millennium solutions live in 2003, bringing the cumulative number of solutions implemented to more than 2,600 at more than 550 client facilities. These results included significant progress at implementing computerized physician order entry (CPOE), which is the application generating the highest level of industry attention. 23 Table of Contents The Companys strong operational performance is also reflected in its cash flow results. In 2003, the Company generated $134,150,000 of cash flow from operations, with days sales outstanding decreasing from 116 days at the end of 2002 to 103 days at the end of 2003. This strong performance was driven by continued improvements in delivering value to clients, which we believe makes it easier to obtain better payment terms in the Companys contracts. In 2003, the Company organized geographically. The Companys six geographic business segments are: Great Lakes, Mid America, North Atlantic, Southeast, West and Global. The Company has not presented comparable information for prior periods as necessary information is not available and the cost to develop it would be excessive. Operating Segments Great Mid North South 2003 Lakes America Atlantic east West Global Other Total Revenues $ 153,949 $ 160,633 $ 149,585 $ 145,312 $ 161,840 $ 54,191 $ 14,077 $ 839,587 Cost of revenues 36,910 35,447 37,520 40,784 28,321 13,450 1,858 194,290 Operating expenses 24,897 24,815 26,788 29,454 28,223 35,814 397,209 567,200 Total costs and expenses 61,807 60,262 64,308 70,238 56,544 49,264 399,067 761,490 Operating earnings $ 92,142 $ 100,371 $ 85,277 $ 75,074 $ 105,296 $ 4,927 $ (384,990 ) $ 78,097 Healthcare Information Technology Market The Company believes the market for healthcare information technology remains substantial. The healthcare industry continues to significantly outpace the growth of the economy, with the most recent Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data indicating that healthcare spending in the United States totaled $1.7 trillion in 2003, representing approximately 15% of the Gross Domestic Product, after holding steady at 13.3% through most of the 1990s. The Company believes that volume from the front edge of the aging baby boomers is a fundamental driver behind this growth. And based on the demographics, the volume will increase over the next 20 years. The Company believes a convergence is occurring among many of healthcares major stakeholders, including hospital and health system boards of directors, chief executives, and the doctors and nurses. This convergence is lessening resistance to making fundamental changes, and these major stakeholders are beginning to accept the adoption of healthcare information technology as strategic to their success. Cerner solutions and services provide opportunities to alter the manual and inefficient manner in which this industry operates, as well as to address the issues of quality, safety, efficiency and workforce shortages. Further, the healthcare information technology industry stands to benefit as investment in information technology increasingly becomes a hot political topic. For example, the Medicare reform bill contains important provisions on quality and pay for performance a foundation that should accelerate the industrys automation efforts. And the President affirmatively mentioned computerizing health records in his January 2004 State of the Union Address. There are also generally positive trends in the condition of healthcare providers, and the Company views their overall condition as relatively stable, with the primary exception being hospitals with a higher mix of Medicaid revenues. Recent data from SP supports the belief that the economic health of providers is stabilizing as it indicates that higher reimbursement, coupled with sustained demand for services, should improve the credit quality of hospitals. Results of Operations Year Ended January 3, 2004, Compared to Year Ended December 28, 2002 The Companys revenues increased 8% to $839,587,000 in 2003 from $780,262,000 in 2002. The Company had net earnings of $42,791,000 in 2003 compared to $48,022,000 in 2002. Operating results 24 Table of Contents for 2002, as described below, included a gain on the sale of available for sale securities and a charge for the impairment of investments, and a change in accounting principle for goodwill. The decrease in net earnings is due primarily to a higher increase in expenses than revenue compared to the prior year. As discussed above, revenue increased less than the Company expected because of the decrease in new contract bookings in the first quarter of 2003 and the shift in bookings mix to more managed services and subscription bookings which are recognized as revenue over longer periods of time. The increase in expenses was driven primarily by continued investments in the Companys development of software and by sales and client services expenses. Expense also increased because the Companys 2003 fiscal year consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2002. Operating results for 2002, as described below, included a gain on the sale of available for sale securities and a charge for the impairment of investments, and a change in accounting principle for goodwill. Revenues In 2003, revenues increased due to an increase in support of installed systems and an increase in services. Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 14% to $476,795,000 in 2003 from $419,578,000 in 2002. Support and maintenance revenues were $209,877,000 and $171,238,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Services revenues were $266,918,000 and $248,340,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware and professional services, excluding installation. This increase in support and maintenance revenue was due primarily to the increase in the Companys installed and converted client base, that was driven by bringing a record number of Cerner Millennium solutions live in 2002 and 2003. The increase in services revenue was driven primarily by an increase in revenue from managed services, which increased $20,000,000 to $34,000,000 as the Company continued to experience high levels of demand for hosting solutions in its data center. System sales were $332,349,000 in 2003 compared to $332,274,000 in 2002. Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software. System sales were flat because of the aforementioned first quarter bookings shortfall and because of a shift in the mix of bookings during the year. Beginning in the first quarter of 2003, the Company began including proceeds from reimbursed travel expense in revenue with a corresponding amount included in cost of revenues. This change has no impact on the dollar amount of gross margin, operating margin or net earnings, but does slightly change the percent of revenue each of these items represent. Reimbursed travel was $30,443,000 in 2003 compared to $28,410,000 in 2002. At January 3, 2004, the Company had $938,221,000 in contract backlog and $312,887,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $732,719,000 in contract backlog and $269,153,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2002. Cost of Revenues The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 23% of total revenues in 2003, and 24% of total revenues in 2002. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from a decrease in the percent of revenue from computer hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of revenue percentage. The Company believes this trend could continue because of strong demand for its managed service offering, which results in lower hardware sales because the client does not pay for hardware upfront when it chooses this offering. Sales and Client Service Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 42% and 41% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in total sales and client service expenses is attributable to the cost of marketing of solutions. Expenses also increased due to the extra week in the 2003 fiscal year as described above. 25 Table of Contents Software Development Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2003 and 2002 were $179,999,000 and $149,985,000, respectively. These amounts exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $58,736,000 and $49,984,000 for 2003 and 2002, respectively. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses and professional fees. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% and 6% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest Expense, Net Interest income was $1,219,000 in 2003 compared to $1,080,000 in 2002. This increase is due primarily to an increase in invested cash in 2003 compared to 2002. Interest expense was $8,236,000 in 2003 compared to $6,635,000 in 2002. This increase is due primarily to the increase in debt. On December 20, 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement dated December 15, 2002. Other Income, Net Other income increased to $142,000 in 2003 from $87,000 in 2002. Included in other revenues are revenues from office space leased to third parties. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Investment In December 2002, the Company exercised 1,048,783 warrants of WebMD with an exercise price of $3.08 and a cost basis and carrying value of $4,146,000. The warrants were scheduled to expire on January 26, 2003. In December 2002, the Company sold 1,048,783 shares of WebMD for $8,242,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of $527,000, net of $342,000 in tax, as a result of the exercise of the warrants and the sale of the shares. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company sold 14,820,527 shares of WebMD for $90,119,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of $2,736,000, net of $1,572,000 in tax, as a result of the sale. Impairment of Investment The Companys policy is to review declines in fair value of its marketable equity securities for declines that may be other than temporary. Based on events occurring in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $6,281,000, net of tax of $3,623,000, for the impairment of various investments in non publicly traded securities. The charge is primarily related to a $3,464,000, net of tax, write down of the Companys investment in Protocare, Inc, a non publicly traded company. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate was 39.9% in 2003 and 39.4% in 2002. As a result of a decrease in net income from 2002 to 2003, the impact of permanent differences increased the Companys effective tax rate. Accounting Change Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company completed its transitional review of the Companys goodwill values in the second quarter of 2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units. Year Ended December 28, 2002, Compared to Year Ended December 29, 2001 The Companys revenues increased 39% to $780,262,000 in 2002 from $560,802,000 in 2001. The Company had net earnings of $48,022,000 in 2002 compared to a net loss of $42,366,000 in 2001. Operating results for 2002, as described below, included a gain on the sale of available for sale securities and a charge for the impairment of investments, and a change in accounting principle for goodwill. 26 Table of Contents Operating results for 2001, as described below, included a gain on software license settlement and investment losses. Revenues In 2002, revenues increased due to an increase in system sales, support of installed systems and an increase in services. System sales increased 36% to $332,274,000 in 2002 from $244,979,000 in 2001. Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software. The increase in system sales is due to an increase in new contract bookings in 2002 compared to 2001. Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 41% to $419,578,000 in 2002 from $297,444,000 in 2001. Support and maintenance revenues were $171,238,000 and $140,666,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Services revenues were $248,340,000 and $156,778,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware, and professional services, excluding installation. This increase was due primarily to the increase in professional services, resulting from an increase in services related to and services provided into the Companys installed and converted client base. At December 28, 2002, the Company had $732,719,000 in contract backlog and $269,153,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $566,280,000 in contract backlog and $221,393,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2001. Cost of Revenues The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 24% of total revenues in 2002, and 21% of total revenues in 2001. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The increase in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from an increase in the percent of revenue from computer hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of revenue percentage. Sales and Client Service Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 41% in 2002 and 40% in 2001. The increase in total sales and client service expenses is attributable to the cost of a larger field sales and services organization and marketing of new solutions. Software Development Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2002 and 2001 were $149,985,000 and $113,872,000, respectively. These amounts exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $49,984,000 and $37,828,000 for 2002 and 2001, respectively. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses and professional fees. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 6% in 2002 and 7% in 2001. Interest Expense, Net Interest income was $1,080,000 in 2002 compared to $2,896,000 in 2001. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in interest rates and average invested cash. Interest expense was $6,635,000 in 2002 compared to $7,321,000 in 2001, primarily as a result of lower borrowing levels during the year. Other Income, Net Other income decreased to $87,000 in 2002 from $182,000 in 2001. Included in other revenues are revenues from office space leased to third parties. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Investment In December 2002, the Company exercised 1,048,783 warrants of WebMD with an exercise price of $3.08 and a cost basis and carrying value of $4,146,000. The warrants 27 Table of Contents were scheduled to expire on January 26, 2003. In December 2002, the Company sold 1,048,783 shares of WebMD for $8,242,000.

Impairment of Investment The Companys policy is to review declines in fair value of its marketable equity securities for declines that may be other than temporary. Based on events occurring in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $6,281,000, net of tax of $3,623,000, for the impairment of various investments in non publicly traded securities. The charge is primarily related to a $3,464,000, net of tax, write down of the Companys investment in Protocare, Inc, a non publicly traded company. During the second quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a write down of its investment in WebMD from $15.00 to $5.79. Accordingly, the Company recognized a charge to earnings of $81,419,000, net of $46,197,000 in tax. Gain on Software License Settlement On June 18, 2001, the Company reached an agreement with WebMD Corporation regarding certain performance metrics related to specified levels of physician usage arising out of the original license transaction between the Company and WebMD. Under the agreement, the Company received 2,000,000 shares of WebMD stock, valued at $11,580,000, in exchange for $432,000 in cash and the cancellation of various obligations due to the Company by WebMD. As a result of this agreement, the Company recognized a gain of $4,836,000, net of $2,744,000 in tax. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate was an expense of 39% in 2002 and a benefit of 33% in 2001. The benefit is a result of the loss on the WebMD shares and other permanent differences. Accounting Change Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company completed its transitional review of the Companys goodwill values in the second quarter of 2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of the Companys revenues, its cash collections from its clients and the amounts the Company invests in software development, acquisitions and capital expenditures. The Companys principal source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents. The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements. At January 3, 2004 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $121,839,000 and working capital of $251,500,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $142,543,000 and working capital of $282,135,000 at December 28, 2002. The Company generated cash of $134,150,000, $36,906,000 and $64,838,000 from operations in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash flow from operations increased in 2003 due primarily to increased collections of receivables, improved payment terms and record level conversions. The Company has periodically provided long term financing options to creditworthy clients through third party financing institutions and has on occasion directly provided extended payment terms from contract date. Certain of these receivables have been assigned on a non recourse basis to third party financing institutions. The Company has provided its usual and customary performance guarantees to the third party financing institutions in connection with its on going obligations under the client contract. During 2003 and 2002, the Company generated cash flow from third party client financing arrangements and non recourse payment assignments aggregating $58,654,000 and $30,073,000, respectively. Days 28 Table of Contents sales outstanding decreased from 116 days at the end of 2002 to 103 days at the end of 2003. Although the Company continues with its initiative to improve days sales outstanding, we do not expect the rate of decline experienced in 2003 to continue. Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements represent recurring cash flows. Support and maintenance revenues increased 23% in 2003 and 22% in each of 2002 and 2001, and the Company expects these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed systems grows. Cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capitalized software development costs of $58,736,000 and $49,984,000 and purchases of capital equipment, land and buildings of $83,583,000 and $59,699,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company began construction of a new facility situated between the buildings located at 2800 and 2900 Rockcreek Parkway on the Companys World Headquarters campus (Campus). This facility was completed on August 1, 2003 and is approximately 123,000 square feet in size. This new facility, referred to as Cerners World Headquarters Building, houses offices, a cafeteria and meeting space for the Company. In 2002, the Company also began construction of a new office building located on the Campus. This facility was completed in December of 2003 and houses office and meeting space for the Company. The Company also completed acquisitions of businesses for $6,380,000 and $26,016,000, net of cash received, in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2002, the Company had proceeds from the sale of shares of WebMD of $95,134,000. Prior to June 2002, the Company had a loan agreement with a bank that provided for a current revolving line of credit for working capital purposes. In June 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks led by U.S. Bank. The new credit facility increased the amount the Company may borrow from $45,000,000 to $90,000,000. The fee rate on the new facility is approximately the same as the prior facility. The revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of interest only. Interest is payable at the Companys option at a rate based on prime (4.00% at January 3, 2004) or LIBOR (1.12% at January 3, 2004) plus 2%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1% if certain net worth ratios are maintained. At January 3, 2004, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. The agreement contains certain net worth, debt levels and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. A commitment fee of 1/2% or 3/10% is payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit matures on May 31, 2005. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 3, 2004. In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in three equal annual installments beginning in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a $39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual installments beginning December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the bank loan agreement and will be used for general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 3, 2004. In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, are payable in five equal annual installments beginning in April 2002. The Series B Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual installments beginning April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire the Companys existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for capital improvements and to strengthen the Companys cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth, current, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 3, 2004. The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash generated from operations and if necessary the line of credit, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during 2004. 29 Table of Contents The following table represents a summary of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 3, 2004, except short term purchase order commitments arising in the ordinary course. Payments due by period 2009 and Contractual Obligations (in thousands) 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 thereafter Total Long Term Debt Obligations 21,162 21,358 28,246 15,004 14,295 45,667 145,732 Lease Obligations 11,320 6,121 4,184 3,085 2,659 6,872 34,241 Acquisition Related Commitments 4,318 5,000 9,318 Supplier Software Purchase Commitments 6,117 1,592 7,709 Other 1,233 1,800 1,700 4,733 Total 44,150 30,871 34,130 23,089 16,954 52,539 201,733 The effects of inflation on the Companys business during 2003, 2002 and 2001 were not significant. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the Companys historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving managements judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development, other than temporary declines in the market value of investments, concentrations, allowance for doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill. These policies and the Companys procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within the Discussion and Analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Note 1 to the accompanying financial statements expands upon discussion of the Companys accounting policies. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes its multiple element arrangements, including software and software related services, using the residual method under SOP 98 9. Key factors in our revenue recognition model are managements assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of our software whereas implementation services are not. If our business model were to change such that implementation services became essential to the functionality of our software, the period of time over which our licensed software revenue were to be recognized would lengthen. We generally recognize revenue from the sale of our licensed software over two key milestones, delivery and installation, based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation. Additionally, if the time to achieve our delivery and installation milestones for our licensed software were to be accelerated or decelerated, our milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for our licensed software could materially change. Software Development Costs Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators, Internet based start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions, 30 Table of Contents product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment. Investments The Company accounts for its investments in equity securities, which have readily determinable fair values as available for sale. Available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. For realized gains and losses on available for sale investments, the Company utilizes the specific identification method as the basis to determine cost. Investments in the common stock of certain affiliates over which the Company exerts significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. The Company has certain other minority equity investments in non publicly traded securities. These investments are generally carried at cost as the Company owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. The balance of these investments at January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 was $680,000 and $876,000, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the market for technologies and content by these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be significant. The Company could lose its entire investment in certain or all of these companies. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary. The Company reviews all equity securities for declines in fair value. If such declines are considered to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis, and the amount of the write down is included in earnings. Concentrations Substantially all of the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, are held at three major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of the Companys cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. Substantially all of the Companys clients are integrated delivery networks, hospitals and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Companys access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future results. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts If the creditworthiness of our clients were to weaken or our collections results relative to historical experience were to decline, it could have a material adverse impact on operations and cash flows. Goodwill Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company completed its transitional review of the Companys goodwill values in the second quarter of 2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company again assessed its goodwill for impairment in the second quarter of 31 Table of Contents 2003 and concluded that no goodwill was impaired. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods. The Company completed three acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001, which resulted in approximately, $36.7 million of goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with SFAS 142. For the year ended 2001, earnings included $1,758,000 of amortization of goodwill, net of tax. Goodwill amounted to $51,573,000 and $45,938,000 at January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2003, respectively. If future, anticipated cash flows from the Companys reporting units, that recognized goodwill, did not materialize as expected the Companys goodwill could be impaired, which would result in significant write offs. Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations, Financial Condition or Business Statements made in this report, the Annual Report to Shareholders in which this report is made a part, other reports and proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, communications to shareholders, press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the Company that are not historical in nature, or that state the Companys or managements intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology, such as could, should, will, intended, continue, believe, may, expect, hope, anticipate, goal, forecast, plan, or estimate or the negative of these words, variations thereof or similar expressions. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. It is important to note that any such performance and actual results, financial condition or business, could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere herein or in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unforeseen factors not identified herein could also have such an effect. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results, financial condition or business over time. Quarterly Operating Results May Vary The Companys quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods. Quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes mandated by regulating entities, demand for the Companys software solutions and services, the Companys long sales cycle, potentially long installation and implementation cycles for these larger, more complex and costlier systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report. As a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for the Companys Cerner Millennium solutions, a large percentage of the Companys revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger, more complex and costlier systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client. The sale may be subject to delays due to clients internal budgets and procedures for approving large capital expenditures and by competing needs for other capital expenditures and deploying new technologies or personnel resources. Delays in the expected sale or installation of these large contracts may have a significant impact on the Companys anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently its earnings, since a significant percentage of the Companys expenses are relatively fixed. These larger, more complex and costlier systems are installed and implemented over time periods ranging from approximately one month to three years and may involve significant efforts both by the Company and the client. The Company recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon the Companys and the clients ability to meet these project milestones. Delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract relating to one or more of these systems could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter. In addition, support payments by clients for the Companys solutions generally do not commence until the solution is in use. 32 Table of Contents The Companys revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year, primarily as a result of the clients year end efforts to make all final capital expenditures for the then current year. Stock Price May Be Volatile The trading price of the Companys common stock may be volatile. The market for the Companys common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results, rumors about the Companys performance or software solutions, changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, healthcare reform measures, client relationship developments, changes occurring in the securities markets in general and other factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. As a matter of policy, the Company does not generally comment on rumors. Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software, healthcare and information technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Companys common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. Market Risk of Investments The Company accounts for its investments in equity securities, which have readily determinable fair values as available for sale. Available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in the common stock of certain affiliates over which the Company exerts significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in other equity securities are reported at cost. The Company reviews all equity securities for declines in fair value. If such declines are considered to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value at a new cost basis, and the amount of the write down is included in earnings. The Company also has certain other minority equity investments in non publicly traded securities. These investments are generally carried at cost as the Company owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies. The carrying value of these investments at January 3, 2004 and December 28, 2002 was $680,000 and $876,000, respectively. These investments are inherently high risk as the market for technologies and content by these companies are usually early stage at the time of the investment by the Company and such markets may never be significant. The Company could lose its entire investment in certain or all of these companies. The Company monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary. At January 3, 2004, marketable securities (which consist of money market and commercial paper) of the Company were recorded at cost, which approximates fair value of approximately $122 million, with an overall average return of approximately 1.56% and an overall weighted maturity of less than 90 days. The marketable securities held by the Company are not subject to significant price risk as a result of the short term nature of the investments. The Company has limited exposure to material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on long term debt since substantially all of its long term debt is at a fixed rate. The Company also had no borrowings outstanding under its working capital line of credit, which has a variable interest rate based on prime (4% at January 3, 2004) or LIBOR (1.12% at January 3, 2004) plus 2%. To date, the Company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The Company conducts business in several foreign jurisdictions. However, the business transacted is in the local functional currency and the Company does not currently have any material exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses. All other business transactions are in U.S. dollars. To date, the Company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk. Changes in the Healthcare Industry The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. For example, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105 32) contains significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid and began to have its initial 33 Table of Contents impact in 1998 due to limitations on reimbursement, resulting cost containment initiatives, and effects on pricing and demand for capital intensive systems. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is having a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions/code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the protection of patient health information. These factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations. Federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems. These programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate. Healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in the Companys software solutions and services. Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for the Companys software solutions and services. As the healthcare industry consolidates, the Companys client base could be eroded, competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of acquiring each client becomes greater. Significant Competition The market for healthcare information systems is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings, the stability of the information systems provider, the features and capabilities of the information systems, the ongoing support for the system and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions. Certain of the Companys competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than the Company and some of its competitors offer software solutions that it does not offer. The Companys principal existing competitors include GE Medical Systems, Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corporation, IDX Systems Corporation, McKesson Corporation, Eclipsys Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc. (Meditech) and Epic Systems Corporation, each of which offers a suite of software solutions that compete with many of the Companys software solutions and services. There are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing software solutions. In addition, the Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators, Internet based start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software/solutions or services. The pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new software solution introductions, software solution enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the Companys success will depend upon its ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce, on a timely and cost effective basis, new and enhanced software solutions and services that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance. Proprietary Technology May Be Subjected to Infringement Claims or May Be Infringed Upon The Company relies upon a combination of license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of its proprietary information. The Company also relies on trademark and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property. The Company has initiated a patent program but currently has a very limited patent portfolio. As a result, the Company may not be able to protect against misappropriation of its intellectual property. In addition, the Company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of its software solutions and services expands. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend. If the Company becomes liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, it could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the software solutions that contain the infringing intellectual property. 34 Table of Contents Government Regulation The United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) has declared that software products intended for the maintenance of data used in making decisions regarding the suitability of blood donors and the release of blood or blood components for transfusion are medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Act) and amendments to the Act. As a consequence, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA with regard to its blood bank software. If other of the Companys software solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the FDA, the Company could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing requirements including pre market notification clearance prior to marketing. Complying with these FDA regulations would be time consuming and expensive. It is possible that the FDA may become more active in regulating computer software that is used in healthcare. There have been four FDA inspections since 1998 at various Cerner sites. Three of the FDA inspections resulted in no FDA Form 483 being issued while one of the four inspections resulted in the issuance of a one item FDA Form 483 that the Company responded to promptly. There can be no assurance, however, that the Companys actions taken in response to the Form 483 will be deemed adequate by the FDA or that additional actions on behalf of the Company will not be required. In addition, the Company remains subject to periodic FDA inspections and there can be no assurances that the Company will not be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure by the Company to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Companys ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its software solutions. The FDA has many enforcement tools including recalls, seizures, injunctions, civil fines and or criminal prosecutions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition. Product Related Liabilities Many of the Companys software solutions provide data for use by healthcare providers in providing care to patients. Although no such claims have been brought against the Company to date regarding injuries related to the use of its software solutions, such claims may be made in the future. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it believes is sufficient for its business, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought in the future, prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful claim brought against the Company, which is uninsured, or under insured could materially harm its business, results of operations or financial condition. System Errors and Warranties The Companys systems, particularly the Cerner Millennium versions, are very complex. As with complex systems offered by others, the Companys systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced. Although the Company conducts extensive testing, it has discovered software errors in its software solutions after their introduction. The Companys systems are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Therefore, users of the Company software solutions have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally. The Companys agreements with its clients typically provide warranties against material errors and other matters. Failure of a clients system to meet these criteria could constitute a material breach under such contracts allowing the client to cancel the contract and obtain a refund and or damages, or could require the Company to incur additional expense in order to make the system meet these criteria. The Companys contracts with its clients generally limit the Companys liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions or circumstances. Risks Associated with the Companys Global Operations The Company markets, sells and services its software solutions globally. The Company has established offices around the world, including in North America, Europe and in the Asia Pacific region. The Company will continue to expand its global operations and enter new global markets. This expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect global sales and support channels. In some countries, the Companys success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. There is a risk that the Company may sometimes choose the wrong partner. For these reasons, the Company may not be able to maintain or increase global market demand for its software solutions. 35 Table of Contents Global operations are subject to inherent risks, and the Companys future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include: Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods; Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; The impact of economic conditions outside the United States; Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; Certification or regulatory requirements; Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; Potentially adverse tax consequences; Different of additional functionality requirements; Trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements; Service provider and government spending patterns; Natural disasters, war or terrorist acts; Poor selection of a partner in a country; and Political conditions which may impact sales or threaten the safety of associates or the continued presence of the Company in these countries. Recruitment and Retention of Key Personnel To remain competitive in the healthcare information technology industry, the Company must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing, consulting and technical personnel, including executives, consultants, programmers and systems architects skilled in the healthcare information technology industry and the technical environments in which the Companys solutions operate. Competition for such personnel in this industry is intense. The Companys failure to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Companys prospects for long term growth. The success of the Company is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key management, sales, marketing, consulting and technical personnel. The Company has succession plans in place; however, the unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact to the Companys business and results of operations, and could potentially inhibit solution development and market share advances.
