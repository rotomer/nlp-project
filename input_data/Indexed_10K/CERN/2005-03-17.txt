Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Cerner Corporation (Cerner or the Company) is headquartered in North Kansas City, Missouri. Cerner derives revenue by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions and hardware that gives healthcare providers secure access to clinical, administrative and financial data in real time, allowing them to improve the quality, safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. Cerner implements these solutions as stand alone, combined or enterprise wide systems. Cerner solutions can be managed by the Companys clients or in Cerners data center via a managed services model. Results Overview The Company delivered strong results in 2004. Total new business bookings, which reflect the value of contracts for software, hardware, services and managed services (hosting of software in the Companys data center), were $917,367,000 in 2004, an increase of 13% compared to $811,258,000 in 2003. Total revenues for 2004 were $926,356,000, an increase of 10% compared to 2003. The revenue composition was $351,861,000 in system sales, $241,439,000 in support and maintenance, $300,975,000 in services and $32,081,000 in reimbursed travel. Systems sales revenue, which includes licensed software, sub licensed software, hardware, and subscriptions, grew 6% in 2004. Services revenue, which includes managed services, grew 13% for the year. Support and maintenance revenue grew 15% for the year. The Companys solid bookings drove a 27% year over year increase in contract backlog, which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue, and ended the year at $1,191,170,000. Backlog grew faster than revenue again in 2004 as the Company continued to experience strong growth in managed services and subscription bookings, which are recognized as revenue over a longer period of time than other types of bookings, such as software and hardware. Collectively, managed services and subscription bookings accounted for about 24% of total bookings margin in 2004 compared to approximately 20% in 2003 and 15% in 2002. This continued shift in mix provides greater visibility of revenue going into 2005 and beyond. The strong growth in managed services bookings contributed to a decline in hardware bookings and hardware revenue in 2004 as clients electing managed services do not need to make the upfront hardware purchase that they would make in a transaction that does not include managed services. As a result, hardware revenue declined 18% in 2004 compared to 2003. Licensed software revenue grew at a strong rate of 14% in 2004, but this growth was partially offset by the decline in hardware revenue, resulting in lower system sales growth of 6% for 2004. Despite the near term impact on system sales, the Company views this mix shift favorably because the higher level of managed services bookings improves the visibility of future revenue streams. Net earnings increased from $42,791,000 in 2003 to $64,648,000 in 2004. Included in 2004 results are an adjustment in the third quarter of 2004 related to a prior period vacation pay accrual (see Note 14 to consolidated financial statements) that reduced net earnings by $2,076,000, net of $1,270,000 of tax, and a gain on the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated in the first quarter of 2004 that increased net earnings by $1,826,000, net of $1,197,000 of tax. Excluding these two items, 2004 net earnings would have been $250,000 higher, or $64,898,000. The increase in net earnings was driven by revenue growth and margin expansion. Operating margins were 12.0% (12.4% prior to the vacation accrual adjustment) for 2004 compared to 9.3% in 2003. Going forward, management believes the Company can continue to increase operating margins by expanding margins on services, leveraging investments in research and development, and controlling sales, general and administrative spending. 22 Table of Contents The Companys operational performance was also very strong in 2004. The Company brought a record 1,079 Cerner Millennium solutions live in 2004, bringing the cumulative number of solutions implemented to more than 3,700 at nearly 750 client facilities. These results included significant progress at implementing computerized physician order entry (CPOE), which is the application generating the highest level of industry attention. The Companys strong operational performance is also reflected in its cash flow results. In 2004, the Company generated $168,304,000 of cash flow from operations, compared to $134,150,000 in 2003. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capitalized software, was $52,902,000 in 2004 compared to ($8,169,000) in 2003. Healthcare Information Technology Market The Company believes the market for healthcare information technology remains strong. The healthcare information technology industry, and Cerner specifically, continues to benefit from the focus healthcare providers have placed on using technology to drive major patient safety and quality initiatives into their organizations with the ultimate goal of becoming completely digital or paperless. In addition, the Company continues to benefit from its clients increased desire to have a common architecture spanning clinical, management and financial solutions. In many ways, the Company believes 2004 was a defining year for the healthcare information technology industry. President Bush began the year by proclaiming in his State of the Union Address that we can avoid dangerous medical mistakes, reduce costs and improve care by computerizing health records. The President also established a goal for every American to have a personal health record within the next 10 years, and he reaffirmed that goal in his 2005 State of the Union Address. In the spring of 2004, the President created a sub cabinet position at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to spearhead this effort. In the summer of 2004, Senator Hillary Clinton and Majority Leader Bill Frist took to the pages of the Washington Post to opine in bipartisan fashion that information technology is central to solving the healthcare crisis. And as the Democratic and Republican parties laid out their agendas in January of 2005 for the 109th Congress, both signaled a strong commitment to healthcare information technology. Finally, 2004 saw more widespread adoption of pay for performance compensation systems for both hospitals and physician offices. Employers such as General Motors, Delta Airlines, UPS, Verizon, General Electric, and Boeing led the way both at the company level and through The Leapfrog Groups standards. And in February of 2005, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the first ever Medicare pay for performance initiative for doctors. In summary, 2004 was an exciting year of increased focus on healthcare information technology. Although no assurances can be provided, management believes, and recent events suggest, that this momentum could continue. Results of Operations Year Ended January 1, 2005, Compared to Year Ended January 3, 2004 The Companys revenues increased 10% to $926,356,000 in 2004 from $839,587,000 in 2003. The Company had net earnings of $64,648,000 in 2004 compared to $42,791,000 in 2003. Included in 2004 net earnings are an adjustment in the third quarter of 2004 related to a prior period vacation pay accrual that reduced net earnings by $2,076,000, net of $1,270,000 of tax, and a gain on the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated, in the first quarter of 2004 that increased net earnings by $1,826,000, net of $1,197,000 of tax. Excluding these two items, 2004 net earnings would have been $250,000 higher, or $64,898,000. Revenues In 2004, revenues increased due to an increase in system sales, support of installed systems and an increase in services. Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 14% to $542,414,000 in 2004 from $476,795,000 in 2003. Support and maintenance revenues were $241,439,000 and $209,876,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Services revenues were $300,975,000 23 Table of Contents and $266,918,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware, managed services and professional services, excluding installation. The increase in support and maintenance revenue was due primarily to the increase in the Companys installed and converted client base, that was driven by bringing a record number of Cerner Millennium solutions live in 2003 and 2004. The increase in services revenue was driven by increased professional services billable hours and a strong increase in managed services. System sales increased 6% to $351,861,000 in 2004 from $332,349,000 in 2003. Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software. This increase is due primarily to an increase in license software sales that was partially offset by declines in hardware sales. At January 1, 2005, the Company had $1,191,170,000 in contract backlog and $347,662,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $938,221,000 in contract backlog and $312,887,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2003. Cost of Revenues The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 21% of total revenues in 2004, and 23% of total revenues in 2003. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from a decrease in the percent of revenue from computer hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of revenue percentage. The Company believes this trend could continue because of strong demand for its managed service offering, which results in lower hardware sales because the client does not purchase hardware when it chooses this offering. Sales and Client Service Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 41% and 42% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in total sales and client service expenses to $383,628,000 in 2004 from $352,728,000 in 2003 is primarily due to an increase in personnel and personnel related expenses. The decrease in this spending as a percent of total revenue reflects the Companys ability to get better utilization of its resources and leverage this spending over a larger revenue stream. Software Development Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2004 and 2003 were $188,264,000 and $179,999,000, respectively. These amounts exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $58,912,000 and $58,736,000 for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in aggregate expenditures in software development in 2004 is due to continued development of Cerner Millennium solutions. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses and professional fees. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% in both 2004 and 2003. Total general and administrative expenses were $63,327,000 and $58,236,000 for 2004 and 2003, respectively. General and administrative expenses for 2004 include a prior period adjustment to increase vacation pay accrual of $3,346,000. Excluding the adjustment to increase vacation pay accrual, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 6% in 2004. Interest Expense, Net Interest income was $3,022,000 in 2004 compared to $1,219,000 in 2003. This increase is due primarily to higher interest rates, and a higher cash balance fed by cash collections. Interest expense was $9,174,000 in 2004 compared to $8,236,000 in 2003. 24 Table of Contents Other Income, Net Other income increased from $142,000 in 2003 to $2,608,000 in 2004. This increase is due primarily to a gain on the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated. Also included in other income are revenues from office space leased to third parties. Operations by Segment In 2003, the Company organized geographically. The Companys six geographic business segments are: Great Lakes, Mid America, North Atlantic, Southeast, West and Global. Revenues are derived primarily from the sale of clinical, financial and administrative information systems and solutions. The cost of revenues includes the cost of third party consulting services, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. Operating expenses incurred by the geographic business segments consist of sales and client service expenses including salaries of sales and client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Performance of the segments is assessed at the operating earnings level and, therefore, the segment operations have been presented as such. Other includes revenues not generated by the operating segments and expenses such as software development, marketing, general and administrative and depreciation that have not been allocated to the operating segments. The Company does not track assets by geographical business segment. The following table presents a summary of the operating information for 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): Operating Segments Great Mid North South 2004 Lakes America Atlantic east West Global Other Total Revenues $ 157,627 $ 201,570 $ 179,520 $ 148,186 $ 150,694 $ 64,333 $ 24,426 $ 926,356 Cost of revenues 29,805 32,588 41,050 35,487 28,577 8,938 19,903 196,348 Operating expenses 27,689 31,618 30,487 33,267 33,827 38,411 423,245 618,544 Total costs and expenses 57,494 64,206 71,537 68,754 62,404 47,349 443,148 814,892 Operating earnings $ 100,133 $ 137,364 $ 107,983 $ 79,432 $ 88,290 $ 16,984 $ (418,722 ) $ 111,464 Operating Segments Great Mid North South 2003 Lakes America Atlantic east West Global Other Total Revenues $ 153,949 $ 160,633 $ 149,585 $ 145,312 $ 161,840 $ 54,191 $ 14,077 $ 839,587 Cost of revenues 36,910 35,447 37,520 40,784 28,321 13,450 1,858 194,290 Operating expenses 24,897 24,815 26,788 29,454 28,223 35,814 397,209 567,200 Total costs and expenses 61,807 60,262 64,308 70,238 56,544 49,264 399,067 761,490 Operating earnings $ 92,142 $ 100,371 $ 85,277 $ 75,074 $ 105,296 $ 4,927 $ (384,990 ) $ 78,097 Operating earnings in the Great Lakes segment increased 9% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 2% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in total revenues is due primarily to strong increases in licensed software and support revenues that were largely offset by a decrease in hardware and professional services revenues in 2004 compared to 2003. Costs of revenues were 19% and 24% of total revenues of the Great Lakes segment for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the cost of revenues as a percent of revenue is due primarily to lower hardware sales in 2004 as compared to 2003. Costs of revenues, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, maintenance, support, services and reimbursed travel) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. 25 Table of Contents Operating earnings in the Mid America segment increased 37% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 25% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in total revenues is due primarily to a strong increase in licensed software and professional services revenues in 2004 compared to 2003. Costs of revenues were 16% and 22% of total Mid America segment revenues for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease in the cost of revenues as a percent of revenue is due primarily to lower hardware sales in 2004 as compared to 2003. Operating earnings in the North Atlantic segment increased 27% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 20% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in revenues is due primarily to an increase in licensed software and professional services revenues in 2004 compared to 2003. Costs of revenues were 23% and 25% of total North Atlantic segment revenues for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating earnings in the Southeast segment increased 6% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 2% in 2004 compared to 2003. Costs of revenues were 24% and 28% of total Southeast segment revenues for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in total revenues is due primarily to strong increases in licensed software and support revenues that were largely offset by a decrease in hardware and professional services in 2004 compared to 2003. Operating earnings in the West decreased 16% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues decreased 7% in 2004 compared to 2003. The decrease in total revenues is due primarily to a decrease in licensed software in 2004 compared to 2003. Costs of revenues were 19% and 17% of total West segment revenues for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating expenses increased 20% in 2004 compared to 2003, due primarily to an increase in personnel related expenses. Operating earnings in the Global segment increased 245% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. Total revenues increased 19% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in total revenues is due primarily to an increase in professional services in 2004 compared to 2003. Operating expenses increased 7% in 2004 compared to 2003. These increases are due primarily to an increased presence in the global market. Operating losses in Other increased 9% for the year ended January 1, 2005 compared to the year ended January 3, 2004. This increase is due to an increase in total costs and expenses of 11% in 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in operating expenses is due to an increase in expenses such as software development, marketing, general and administrative and depreciation in 2004 compared to 2003. Year Ended January 3, 2004, Compared to Year Ended December 28, 2002 The Companys revenues increased 8% to $839,587,000 in 2003 from $780,262,000 in 2002. The Company had net earnings of $42,791,000 in 2003 compared to $48,022,000 in 2002. Operating results for 2002, as described below, included a gain on the sale of available for sale securities and a charge for the impairment of investments, and a change in accounting principle for goodwill. The decrease in net earnings is due primarily to a higher increase in expenses than revenue compared to the prior year. As discussed above, revenue increased less than the Company expected because of the decrease in new contract bookings in the first quarter of 2003 and the shift in bookings mix to more managed services and subscription bookings which are recognized as revenue over longer periods of time. The increase in expenses was driven primarily by continued investments in the Companys development of software and by sales and client services expenses. Expenses also increased because the Companys 2003 fiscal year consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2002. Revenues In 2003, revenues increased due to an increase in support of installed systems and an increase in services. Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 14% to $476,795,000 in 2003 from $419,578,000 in 2002. Support and maintenance revenues were $209,877,000 and $171,238,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Services revenues were $266,918,000 and $248,340,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and 26 Table of Contents maintenance of software and hardware and professional services, excluding installation. This increase in support and maintenance revenue was due primarily to the increase in the Companys installed and converted client base, that was driven by bringing a record number of Cerner Millennium solutions live in 2002 and 2003. The increase in services revenue was driven primarily by an increase in revenue from managed services, which increased $20,000,000 to $34,000,000 as the Company continued to experience high levels of demand for hosting solutions in its data center. System sales were $332,349,000 in 2003 compared to $332,274,000 in 2002. Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software. System sales were flat because of the aforementioned first quarter bookings shortfall and because of a shift in the mix of bookings during the year. At January 3, 2004, the Company had $938,221,000 in contract backlog and $312,887,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $732,719,000 in contract backlog and $269,153,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2002. Cost of Revenues The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from computer and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 23% of total revenues in 2003, and 24% of total revenues in 2002. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from a decrease in the percent of revenue from computer hardware and sublicensed software, which carry a higher cost of revenue percentage. Sales and Client Service Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 42% and 41% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in total sales and client service expenses is attributable to the cost of marketing of solutions. Expenses also increased due to the extra week in the 2003 fiscal year as described above. Software Development Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2003 and 2002 were $179,999,000 and $149,985,000, respectively. These amounts exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $58,736,000 and $49,984,000 for 2003 and 2002, respectively. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses and professional fees. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% and 6% in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest Expense, Net Interest income was $1,219,000 in 2003 compared to $1,080,000 in 2002. This increase is due primarily to an increase in invested cash in 2003 compared to 2002. Interest expense was $8,236,000 in 2003 compared to $6,635,000 in 2002. This increase is due primarily to the increase in debt. On December 20, 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement dated December 15, 2002. Other Income, Net Other income increased to $142,000 in 2003 from $87,000 in 2002. Included in other revenues are revenues from office space leased to third parties. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Investment In December 2002, the Company exercised 1,048,783 warrants of WebMD with an exercise price of $3.08 and a cost basis and carrying value of $4,146,000. The warrants were scheduled to expire on January 26, 2003. In December 2002, the Company sold 1,048,783 shares of WebMD for $8,242,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of $527,000, net of $342,000 in tax, as a result of the exercise of the warrants and the sale of the shares. In the second 27 Table of Contents quarter of 2002, the Company sold 14,820,527 shares of WebMD for $90,119,000. Accordingly, the Company recorded an investment gain of $2,736,000, net of $1,572,000 in tax, as a result of the sale. Impairment of Investment The Companys policy is to review declines in fair value of its marketable equity securities for declines that may be other than temporary. Based on events occurring in the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $6,281,000, net of tax of $3,623,000, for the impairment of various investments in non publicly traded securities. The charge is primarily related to a $3,464,000, net of tax, write down of the Companys investment in Protocare, Inc. a non publicly traded company. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate was 39.9% in 2003 and 39.4% in 2002. As a result of a decrease in net income from 2002 to 2003, the impact of permanent differences increased the Companys effective tax rate. Accounting Change Effective December 30, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company completed its transitional review of the Companys goodwill values in the second quarter of 2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of the Companys revenues, its cash collections from its clients and the amounts the Company invests in software development, acquisitions and capital expenditures. The Companys principal source of liquidity is its cash and cash equivalents. The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements. At January 1, 2005 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $189,784,000 and working capital of $310,229,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $121,839,000 and working capital of $246,412,000 at January 3, 2004. The Company generated cash of $168,304,000, $134,150,000 and $36,906,000 from operations in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flow from operations increased in 2004 due primarily to increased collections of receivables, improved payment terms and record level conversions. The Company has periodically provided long term financing options to creditworthy clients through third party financing institutions and typically has directly provided extended payment terms from contract date. Some of these payment streams have been assigned on a non recourse basis to third party financing institutions. The Company has provided its usual and customary performance guarantees to the third party financing institutions in connection with its on going obligations under the client contract. During 2004 and 2003, the Company generated cash flow from third party client financing arrangements and non recourse payment assignments aggregating $53,319,000 and $58,654,000, respectively. Days sales outstanding increased from 103 days at the end of 2003 to 104 days at the end of 2004. Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements represent recurring cash flows. Support and maintenance revenues increased 15% in 2004 and 23% in 2003, and the Company expects these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed systems grows. Cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capitalized software development costs of $58,912,000 and $58,736,000 and purchases of capital equipment, land and buildings of $56,490,000 and $83,583,000 in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company completed acquisitions of businesses for 28 Table of Contents $1,957,000 and $6,380,000, net of cash received, in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company completed the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated in 2004 for $12,000,000. The Companys financing activities for 2004 primarily consisted of repayment of debt of $24,879,000 and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $25,717,000. Financing activities for 2003 primarily consisted of the repayment of long term debt of $13,238,000, the purchase of treasury stock of $5,930,000 and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $6,703,000. Prior to May 2002, the Company had a loan agreement with a bank that provided for a current revolving line of credit for working capital purposes. In May 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a group of banks led by U.S. Bank. The new credit facility increased the amount the Company may borrow from $45,000,000 to $90,000,000. The fee rate on the new facility is approximately the same as the prior facility. The revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of interest only. Interest is payable at the Companys option at a rate based on prime (5.25% at January 1, 2005) or LIBOR (2.4% at January 1, 2005) plus 2%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1.15% if certain net worth ratios are maintained. The agreement contains certain net worth, debt levels and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. A commitment fee of 3/10% to 1/2% is payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit matures on May 31, 2007. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 1, 2005. At January 1, 2005, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. On January 10, 2005, the Company drew down $35,000,000 from its revolving line of credit in connection with the acquisition of the medical business division of VitalWorks, Inc. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in three equal annual installments beginning in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a $39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual installments beginning December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the bank loan agreement and for general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 1, 2005. In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, are payable in five equal annual installments beginning in April 2002. The Series B Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual installments beginning April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire the Companys existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for capital improvements and to strengthen the Companys cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth, current, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at January 1, 2005. The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash generated from operations and the line of credit, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during 2005. The following table represents a summary of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 1, 2005, except short term purchase order commitments arising in the ordinary course of business. 29 Table of Contents Payments due by period 2010 and Contractual Obligations (in thousands) 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 thereafter Total Long Tem Debt Obligations 21,908 28,558 20,207 14,373 16,417 29,249 130,712 Lease Obligations 16,614 12,234 6,428 4,964 3,577 6,634 50,451 Acquisition/Divestiture Related Commitments 250 100 100 25 475 Supplier Software Purchase Commitments 2,872 100 2,972 Other 1,800 1,700 3,500 Total 43,444 42,692 26,735 19,362 19,994 35,883 188,110 The effects of inflation on the Companys business during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were not significant. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payments (SFAS No. 123(R)) which replaces SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123(R) addresses the accounting for share based payments transactions with employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using APB 25 and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of income. The new standard is effective in the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the Statement may have on its consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the Companys historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving managements judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development, concentrations, allowance for doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill. These policies and the Companys procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this Management Discussion and Analysis or Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of the Companys accounting policies. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes its multiple element arrangements, including software and software related services, using the residual method under SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 4, SOP 98 9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletins (SAB) 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements and SAB No. 104 Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force 00 21 Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00 21). Key factors in the Companys revenue recognition model are managements assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the Companys software whereas implementation services are not. If the Companys business model were to change such that implementation services became essential to the functionality of the Companys software, the period of time over which the Companys licensed software revenue were to be recognized would lengthen. The Company generally recognizes revenue from the sale of its licensed software over two key milestones, delivery and installation, based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation. Additionally, if the time to achieve the Companys delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software were to be accelerated or decelerated, its milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change. 30 Table of Contents Software Development Costs Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment. Concentrations Substantially all of the Companys cash and cash equivalents and short term investments, are held at three major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of the Companys cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. Substantially all of the Companys clients are integrated delivery networks, hospitals and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Companys access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future results. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts If the creditworthiness of the Companys clients were to weaken or the Companys collections results relative to historical experience were to decline, it could have a material adverse impact on operations and cash flows. Goodwill The Company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company completed its transitional review of the Companys goodwill values in the second quarter of 2002. As a result of this review, the Company determined that goodwill arising from the acquisition of Mitch Cooper and Associates was impaired due to declining demand and margins in this business. Mitch Cooper and Associates was a supply chain re engineering consulting practice. The impairment charge to reflect this goodwill at fair value was $786,000, net of tax, and is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The Company again assessed its goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of 2004 and 2003 and concluded that no goodwill was impaired. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods. The Company completed five acquisitions and one divestiture subsequent to June 30, 2001, which resulted in approximately $35 million of goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with SFAS 142. Goodwill amounted to $54,600,000 and $51,573,000 at January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004, respectively. If future, anticipated cash flows from the Companys reporting units, that recognized goodwill, do not materialize as expected the Companys goodwill could be impaired, which would result in significant write offs. 31 Table of Contents Factors that may Affect Future Results of Operations, Financial Condition or Business Statements made in this report, the Annual Report to Shareholders in which this report is made a part, other reports and proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, communications to shareholders, press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the Company that are not historical in nature, or that state the Companys or managements intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology, such as could, should, will, intended, continue, believe, may, expect, hope, anticipate, goal, forecast, plan, guidance or estimate or the negative of these words, variations thereof or similar expressions. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. It is important to note that any such performance and actual results, financial condition or business, could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere herein or in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unforeseen factors not identified herein could also have such an effect. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results, financial condition or business over time. Quarterly Operating Results May Vary The Companys quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods, including, variations from guidance, expectations or historical results or trends. Quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes mandated by regulating entities, demand for the Companys software solutions and services, the Companys long sales cycle, potentially long installation and implementation cycles for these larger, more complex and costlier systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report. As a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for the Companys Cerner Millennium solutions, a large percentage of the Companys revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger, more complex and costlier systems. The sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client. Sales may be subject to delays due to changes in clients internal budgets, procedures for approving large capital expenditures, competing needs for other capital expenditures, availability of personnel resources and by actions undertaken by competitors. Delays in the expected sale or installation of these large contracts may have a significant impact on the Companys anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently its earnings, since a significant percentage of the Companys expenses are relatively fixed. The Company recognizes revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon the Companys and the clients ability to meet these project milestones. Delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract relating to one or more of these systems could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter. The Companys revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year, primarily as a result of the clients year end efforts to make all final capital expenditures for the then current year. Stock Price May Be Volatile The trading price of the Companys common stock may be volatile. The market for the Companys common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results, rumors about the Companys performance or software solutions, changes in expectations of future financial performance or changes in estimates of securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, healthcare reform measures, client relationship developments, changes occurring in the securities markets in general and other factors, many of which are beyond the Companys control. As a matter of policy, the Company does not generally comment on rumors. 32 Table of Contents Furthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for software and healthcare and information technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Companys common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. Changes in the Healthcare Industry The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. For example, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public Law 105 32) contained significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid and had an impact for several years on healthcare providers ability to invest in capital intensive systems. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is having a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions/code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the protection of patient health information. These factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations. Federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the U.S. healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems. These programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare, lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate. Healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions, including investments in the Companys software solutions and services. Many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. These providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for the Companys software solutions and services. As the healthcare industry consolidates, the Companys client base could be eroded, competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of acquiring each client becomes greater. Significant Competition The market for healthcare information systems is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in this market include the breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings, the stability of the information systems provider, the features and capabilities of the information systems, the ongoing support for the system and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions. Certain of the Companys competitors have greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and other resources than the Company and some of its competitors offer software solutions that it does not offer. The Companys principal existing competitors include; Eclipsys Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, GE Medical Systems, IDX Systems Corporation, iSoft Corporation, McKesson Corporation, Medical Information Technology, Inc. (Meditech), Misys Healthcare Systems and Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corporation, each of which offers a suite of software solutions that compete with many of the Companys software solutions and services. There are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing software solutions. In addition, the Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators, Internet based start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software/solutions or services. The pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new software solution introductions, software solution enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the Companys success will depend upon its ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce, on a timely and cost effective basis, new and enhanced software solutions and services that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance. Proprietary Technology May Be Subjected to Infringement Claims or May Be Infringed Upon The Company relies upon a combination of license agreements, confidentiality procedures, employee nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to maintain the confidentiality and trade secrecy of its proprietary information. The Company also relies on trademark and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property. The Company has initiated a patent program but currently has a limited patent 33 Table of Contents portfolio. As a result, the Company may not be able to protect against misappropriation of its intellectual property. In addition, the Company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of its software solutions and services expands. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend. If the Company becomes liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, it could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the software solutions that contain the infringing intellectual property. Government Regulation The healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local, state and federal level. Consequently, the Company may be subject to such regulations, which include regulation in the areas of healthcare fraud, medical devices and the security and privacy of patient data, and the risk of changes in the various local, state and federal laws. Healthcare Fraud. The federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting healthcare providers whose services are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Healthcare providers who are clients of the Company are subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals, or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state healthcare programs. Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantial funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse. The effect of this government regulation of the Companys clients is difficult to predict. While the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with any applicable laws, many of the regulations applicable to the Companys clients and that may be applicable to the Company, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the Companys clients to make changes in their operations or the way that they deal with the Company. If the such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable to the Company and if the Company fails to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, it could be subject to sanctions or liability, including exclusion from government health programs and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition. Regulation of Medical Devices. The United States Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) has declared that certain of the Companys software solutions are medical devices that are actively regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (Act) and amendments to the Act. As a consequence, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA with regard to those software solutions that are actively regulated. If other of the Companys software solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the FDA, the Company could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing requirements including pre market notification clearance prior to marketing. Complying with these FDA regulations would be time consuming and expensive. It is possible that the FDA may become more active in regulating computer software that is used in healthcare. There have been six FDA inspections since 1998 at various Cerner sites. Inspections conducted at the Companys World Headquarters in 1999 and its Houston facility in 2002 each resulted in the issuance of an FDA Form 483 that the Company responded to promptly. The FDA has taken no further action with respect to either of the Form 483s that were issued in 1998 and 2002. The remaining four FDA inspections, including an inspection at the Companys World Headquarters in 2004, resulted in no issuance of a Form 483. The Company, however, remains subject to periodic FDA inspections and there can be no assurances that the Company will not be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure by the Company to comply with the Act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Companys ability to continue to manufacture and distribute its software solutions. The FDA has many enforcement tools including recalls, seizures, injunctions, civil fines and or criminal prosecutions. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition. 34 Table of Contents Security and Privacy of Patient Information . State and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released. These regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures. Regulations currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions, security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. Covered entities under HIPAA, which include healthcare organizations such as the Companys clients, were required to comply with the privacy standards by April 2003 and additional transaction regulations by October 2003. Such organizations must also be in compliance with security regulations by April 2005. As a business associate of the covered entities, the Company, in most instances, must also ensure compliance with the HIPAA regulations. The effect of HIPAA on the Companys business is difficult to predict, and there can be no assurances that the Company will adequately address the business risks created by HIPAA and its implementation, or that the Company will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities. Furthermore, the Company is unable to predict what changes to HIPAA, or the regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA, might be made in the future or how those changes could affect the Companys business or the costs of compliance with HIPAA. Evolving HIPAA related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of the Companys clients to obtain, use or disseminate patient information. This could adversely affect demand for the Companys solutions if they are not re designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new regulations that seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable the Companys clients to execute new or modified healthcare transactions. The Company may need to expend additional capital, research and development and other resources to modify its solutions to address these evolving data security and privacy issues. Product Related Liabilities Many of the Companys software solutions provide data for use by healthcare providers in providing care to patients. Although no such claims have been brought against the Company to date regarding injuries related to the use of its software solutions, such claims may be made in the future. Although the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage in an amount that it believes is sufficient for its business, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover a particular claim that may be brought in the future, prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. A successful claim brought against the Company, which is uninsured, or under insured could materially harm its business, results of operations or financial condition. System Errors and Warranties The Companys systems, particularly the Cerner Millennium versions, are very complex. As with complex systems offered by others, the Companys systems may contain errors, especially when first introduced. Although the Company conducts extensive testing, it has discovered software errors in its software solutions after their introduction. The Companys systems are intended for use in collecting and displaying clinical information used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Therefore, users of the Company software solutions have a greater sensitivity to system errors than the market for software products generally. The Companys agreements with its clients typically provide warranties against material errors and other matters. Failure of a clients system to meet these criteria could constitute a material breach under such contracts allowing the client to cancel the contract and obtain a refund and or damages, or could require the Company to incur additional expense in order to make the system meet these criteria. The Companys contracts with its clients generally limit the Companys liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions or circumstances. A successful claim brought against the Company, which is uninsured, or under insured could materially harm its business, results of operations or financial condition. Risks Associated with the Companys Global Operations The Company markets, sells and services its software solutions globally. The Company has established offices around the world, including in the Americas, Europe, in the Middle East and in the Asia Pacific region. The Company will continue to 35 Table of Contents expand its global operations and enter new global markets. This expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop successful direct and indirect global sales and support channels. The business transacted is in the local functional currency and the Company does not currently have any material exposure to foreign currency transaction gains or losses. All other business transactions are in U.S. dollars. To date, the Company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk. In some countries, the Companys success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. There is a risk that the Company may sometimes choose the wrong partner. For these reasons, the Company may not be able to maintain or increase global market demand for its software solutions. Global operations are subject to inherent risks, and the Companys future results could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors. These include: Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods; Difficulties and costs of staffing and managing global operations; The impact of economic conditions outside the United States; Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; Certification or regulatory requirements; Reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries; Potentially adverse tax consequences; Different or additional functionality requirements; Trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements; Service provider and government spending patterns; Natural disasters, war or terrorist acts; Poor selection of a partner in a country; and Political conditions which may impact sales or threaten the safety of associates or the continued presence of the Company in these countries. Recruitment and Retention of Key Personnel To remain competitive in the healthcare information technology industry, the Company must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing, consulting and technical personnel, including executives, consultants, programmers and systems architects skilled in the healthcare information technology industry and the technical environments in which the Companys solutions operate. Competition for such personnel in this industry is intense. The Companys failure to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Companys prospects for long term growth. The success of the Company is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key management, sales, marketing, consulting and technical personnel. The Company has succession plans in place; however, the unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact to the Companys business and results of operations, and could potentially inhibit solution development and market share advances. Third Party Suppliers The Company licenses or purchases intellectual property and technology (such as software, hardware and content) from third parties, including some competitors, and incorporates it into or sells it in conjunction with the Companys software solutions and services, some of which intellectual property or technology is critical to the operation of the Companys solutions. If any of the third party suppliers were to change product offerings, increase prices or terminate the Companys licenses or supply contracts, the Company might need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of the Companys solutions. Such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms, or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the intellectual property or technology provided by the Companys existing suppliers. If the cost of licensing, purchasing or maintaining these third party intellectual property or technology solutions significantly increases, the Companys gross margin levels could significantly decrease. In addition, interruption in functionality of the Companys solutions could adversely affect future sales of licenses and services. Sales Forecasts The Companys sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular quarter. The Company uses a pipeline system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in its business. The Companys sales associates monitor the status of all sales opportunities, such as the date 36 Table of Contents when they estimate that a client will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. The Company compares this pipeline at various points in time to evaluate trends in its business. This analysis provides guidance in business planning and forecasting, but these pipeline estimates are by their nature speculative. The Companys pipeline estimates are not necessarily reliable predictors of revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time, partially because of changes in the pipeline and in conversion rates of the pipeline into contracts that can be very difficult to estimate. A variation in the expected conversion rate or timing of the pipeline into contracts, or in the pipeline itself, could cause the Companys plan or forecast to be inaccurate and thereby adversely affect business results. For example, a slowdown in information technology spending, or economic conditions or a variety of other reasons can cause purchasing decisions to be delayed, reduced in amount or cancelled, which would reduce the overall pipeline conversion rate in a particular period of time. Because a substantial portion of the Companys contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter, the Company may not be able to adjust its cost structure promptly in response to a revenue shortfall resulting from a decrease in its pipeline conversion rate in any given fiscal quarter(s). Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company does not have any significant market risk.
