Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Cerner Corporation (Cerner or the Company) is headquartered in North Kansas City, Missouri. The Company derives revenue by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions and hardware that give healthcare providers secure access to clinical, administrative and financial data in real time, allowing them to improve the quality, safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. Cerner implements these solutions as stand alone, combined or enterprise wide systems. Cerner Millennium software solutions can be managed by the Companys clients or in the Companys data center via a managed services model. Results Overview The Company delivered very strong results in 2005. Total revenues for 2005 were $1,160,785,000, an increase of 25%, over 2004 revenues of $926,356,000. Net Earnings for 2005 were $86,251,000, an increase of 33% over 2004 revenues of $64,648,000. Total new business bookings, which reflect the value of executed contracts for software, hardware, services and managed services (hosting of software in the Companys data center), were at record levels at $1,354,977,000 in 2005, an increase of 48% compared to $917,367,000 in 2004. The Companys operational performance was also strong in 2005. The Company brought more than 1,000 Cerner Millennium solutions live in 2005, bringing the cumulative number of solutions implemented to over 4,800 at over 925 client facilities. These results included significant progress in implementing computerized physician order entry (CPOE), which is the solution generating the highest level of industry attention. The Companys strong operational performance is also reflected in its cash flow results. In 2005, the Company generated $228,865,000 of cash flow from operations, with record cash collections of approximately $1,200,595,000 and days sales outstanding (DSO) decreasing from 104 days at the end of 2004 to 89 days at the end of 2005. Healthcare Information Technology Market 2005 continued a trend of positive developments in the healthcare information technology (HIT) marketplace and for the Company. Overall, the acute care hospital marketplace is in good financial condition. As Moodys reported in January 2006, hospital bond rating upgrades beat downgrades for the first time since 1997. And while some providers are dealing with issues such as an unfavorable payor mix and the responsibility to serve a growing uninsured population, USA Today indicated in January 2006 that hospital profit margins reached a six year high of 5.2 percent in 2004. National policymakers continue looking to HIT. 2005 saw meaningful progress towards a bipartisan consensus on Capital Hill around the view that HIT can deliver significant returns. The RAND Corporation study published in Health Affairs helped shape that perspective by detailing potential savings of $162 billion per year through error reduction, elevated efficiency and improved condition management. For the third consecutive year, President Bush used the State of the Union address in January 2006 to express his support for electronic health records. The President also highlighted the fact that the first of 78 million Baby Boomers turn 60 in 2006, putting strains on the healthcare system and the federal government as the need for care of the Baby Boomers increases. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2005, Compared to Year Ended January 1, 2005 The Companys net earnings increased 33% to $86,251,000 in 2005 compared to $64,648,000 in 2004. Net earnings for 2005 included an adjustment in the third quarter of 2005 related to a prior period for a tax benefit from the carry back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated (Zynx) of $4,749,000 and the write off of acquired in process research and development in the first quarter of 2005 of $3,941,000, net of a $2,441,000 tax benefit. Included in 2004 net earnings are an adjustment in the third quarter of 2004 related to a prior period vacation pay accrual that reduced net earnings by $2,076,000, net of $1,270,000 of tax, and a gain on the sale of Zynx, in the first quarter of 2004 that increased net earnings by $3,023,000. Excluding these four items, 2005 net earnings would have increased 34% to $85,443,000 compared to 2004 net earnings of $63,701,000. Revenues The Companys revenues increased 25% to $1,160,785,000 in 2005 from $926,356,000 in 2004. Revenues for 2005 included revenues from the acquired medical business division of VitalWorks, Inc. (VitalWorks), which closed on January 3, 2005. Excluding the revenue from the medical business division of VitalWorks, 2005 revenues increased 18% over 2004.

Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software, installation fees, transaction processing and subscriptions, with each component growing at least 12% in 2005. This increase is due primarily to an increase in new business bookings and the inclusion of revenue from the medical business division of VitalWorks in 2005. Excluding revenue from the medical business division of VitalWorks, system sales would have increased 17%. Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 25% to $677,664,000 in 2005 from $542,414,000 in 2004. Support and maintenance revenues were $296,716,000 and $241,439,000 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Services revenues were $380,948,000 and $300,975,000 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware, professional services excluding installation, and managed services. These increases were driven by strong performance in delivering Cerner Millennium solutions to clients and the inclusion of revenue from the acquired medical business division of VitalWorks. Excluding revenue from the medical business division of VitalWorks, support, maintenance and service sales would have increased 19%. Contract backlog, which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue, increased 45% in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase is due to an increase in new business bookings in 2005 compared to 2004. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $1,724,583,000 in contract backlog and $415,681,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $1,191,170,000 in contract backlog and $347,662,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2004.

The cost of revenues was 22% of total revenues in 2005, and 21% of total revenues in 2004. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The increase in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from higher levels of hardware sales at lower than historical levels of margin for hardware. Sales and Client Service Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 40% and 41% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in total sales and client service expenses to $466,206,000 in 2005 from $383,628,000 in 2004 is primarily due to an increase in 21 Table of Contents personnel, personnel related expenses and increased presence in the global market.

Software Development Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2005 and 2004 were $226,238,000 and $188,264,000, respectively.

General and administrative expenses for 2004 include an adjustment to increase the vacation pay accrual of $3,346,000, related to prior periods. Excluding the adjustment to increase the vacation pay accrual, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 6% in 2004. The Company had net transaction gains on foreign currency of $2,700,000 for 2005 compared to net transaction losses on foreign currency of $479,000 for 2004. The write off of in process research and development in 2005 is an expense resulting from the acquired medical business division of VitalWorks. Interest Expense, Net Interest income was $3,871,000 in 2005 compared to $3,022,000 in 2004. This increase is due primarily to higher interest rates, and a higher cash balance fed by cash collections. Interest expense was $9,729,000 in 2005 compared to $9,174,000 in 2004. Other Income, Net Other income was $666,000 in 2005 compared to $2,608,000 in 2004. Other income in 2004 included a gain on the sale of Zynx.

Operations by Segment In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company changed its reportable segments to reflect how the chief operating decision maker currently reviews the Companys results in terms of allocating resources and assessing performance.

(See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) This amount was paid in full as of December 31, 2005. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2005. In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, are payable in five equal annual installments that began in April 2002. The Series B Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual installments which commenced in April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire the Companys existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for capital improvements and to strengthen the Companys cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets, and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2005. The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash generated from operations and, if necessary, its line of credit, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during 2006. The following table represents a summary of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments, excluding interest, as of December 31, 2005, except short term purchase order commitments arising in the ordinary course of business. Payments due by period Contractual Obligations (in thousands) 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 and thereafter Total Long term debt obligations 25,667 19,507 13,960 32,417 25,750 100,341 217,642 Capital lease obligations 3,076 1,565 720 5 5,366 Operating lease obligations 17,605 12,418 11,348 7,288 5,661 29,026 83,346 Purchase obligations 13,339 2,493 15,832 Other 1,800 100 25 1,925 Total 61,487 36,083 26,053 39,710 31,411 129,367 324,111 The Company is currently planning to construct a new data center on its campus in North Kansas City at an approximate cost of $60,000,000, which amount is not included above. The construction is expected to start in May 2006 and to be completed in 2007. The effects of inflation on the Companys business during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were not significant. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payments (SFAS No. 123(R)) which replaces SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123(R) addresses the accounting for share based payments transactions with employees and other third parties, eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using APB 25 and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amended the effective date of SFAS 123(R). The effective date of the new standard under these new rules for the Companys consolidated financial statements was January 1, 2006. The Company has elected to adopt the standard using the modified prospective application under the bi nomial method and is currently assessing the impact that the Statement will have on its consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the Companys historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving managements judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development, concentrations, allowance for 27 Table of Contents doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill. These policies and the Companys procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of the Companys accounting policies. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes its multiple element arrangements, including software and software related services, using the residual method under SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 4, SOP 98 9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletins (SAB) 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements and SAB No. 104 Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force 00 21 Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00 21). Key factors in the Companys revenue recognition model are managements assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the Companys software whereas implementation services are not. If the Companys business model were to change such that implementation services became essential to the functionality of the Companys software, the period of time over which the Companys licensed software revenue were to be recognized would lengthen. The Company generally recognizes revenue from the sale of its licensed software over two key milestones, delivery and installation, based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation. Additionally, if the time to achieve the Companys delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software were to be accelerated or decelerated, its milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change. Software Development Costs Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions are expensed until technological feasibility has been established upon completion of a detailed program design. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the healthcare information technology market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment. Concentrations Substantially all of the Companys clients are integrated delivery networks, hospitals and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Companys access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future results. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts If the creditworthiness of the Companys clients were to weaken or the Companys collections results relative to historical experience were to decline, it could have a material adverse impact on operations and cash flows. Goodwill The Company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or 28 Table of Contents whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company again assessed its goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of 2005 and 2004 and concluded that no goodwill was impaired. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods. The Company completed eight acquisitions and one divestiture subsequent to June 30, 2001, which resulted in approximately $97 million of goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with SFAS 142. Goodwill amounted to $116,142,000 and $54,600,000 at December 31, 2005 and January 1, 2005, respectively. If future, anticipated cash flows from the Companys reporting units that recognized goodwill do not materialize as expected the Companys goodwill could be impaired, which would result in significant write offs. Factors that may Affect Future Results of Operations, Financial Condition or Business Statements made in this report, the Annual Report to Shareholders in which this report is made a part, other reports and proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, communications to shareholders, press releases and oral statements made by representatives of the Company that are not historical in nature, or that state the Companys or managements intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Forward looking statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology, such as could, should, will, intended, continue, believe, may, expect, hope, anticipate, goal, forecast, plan, guidance or estimate or the negative of these words, variations thereof or similar expressions. Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. It is important to note that any such performance and actual results, financial condition or business, could differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere herein or in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other unforeseen factors not identified herein could also have such an effect. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes in future operating results, financial condition or business over time. Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. On December 15, 2005, the Company issued 2,251 shares (pre stock split) of its outstanding stock to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center upon exercise of a warrant granted in 2000. The aggregate exercise price was $101,717.06, or $45.1875 (pre stock split) per share. The shares were issued by the Company without registration in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Additionally, and as previously disclosed in the Companys quarterly report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended July 2, 2005, on April 6, 2005, the Company issued 72,536 shares (pre stock split) of its outstanding stock to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center upon exercise of a warrant granted in 2000. The aggregate exercise price was $3,277,720.50, or $45.1875 (pre stock split) per share. The shares were issued by the Company without registration in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk At December 31, 2005, the Company had a 65,000,000 note payable outstanding through a private placement with an interest rate of 5.54%. The note is payable in seven equal installments beginning in November 2009. Because the borrowing is denominated in pounds, the Company is exposed to movements in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Great Britain pound. A 1% change in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Great Britain pound at December 31, 2005 would have had an approximate $1,118,000 change in the balance of the reported amount of the note payable in U.S. dollars. 29 Table of Contents
