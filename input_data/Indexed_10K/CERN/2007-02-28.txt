Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction Cerner Corporation (Cerner or the Company) is headquartered in North Kansas City, Missouri. The Company primarily derives revenue by selling, implementing and supporting software solutions, hardware, healthcare devices and services that give healthcare providers secure access to clinical, administrative and financial data in real time, allowing them to improve the quality, safety and efficiency in the delivery of healthcare. We implement the healthcare solutions as stand alone, combined or enterprise wide systems. Cerner Millennium software solutions can be managed by the Companys clients or in the Companys data center via a managed services model. Results Overview The Company delivered strong results in 2006. Total revenues for 2006 were $1,378,038,000, an increase of 19% over 2005 revenues of $1,160,785,000. Net Earnings for 2006 were $109,891,000, an increase of 27% over 2005 net earnings of $86,251,000. Total new business bookings, which reflect the value of executed contracts for software, hardware, content subscriptions, services and managed services (hosting of clients software in the Companys data center), was a Company record at $1,469,300,000 in 2006, an increase of 8% compared to $1,355,000,000 in 2005. In 2006, the Company generated $232,718,000 of cash flow from operations, with record cash collections of approximately $1,457,600,000 and days sales outstanding (DSO) decreasing from 89 days at the end of 2005 to 87 days at the end of 2006. Healthcare Information Technology Market 2006 continued a trend of positive developments in the healthcare information technology (HIT) marketplace and for the Company. Around the world, healthcare costs continue to rise as healthcare professionals work to uphold quality standards. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has reported that, in the United States, healthcare represents 16 percent of the gross national product, which they project will reach 20 percent by 2015. In this climate, HIT is broadly seen as a way to curb these growing costs while improving the quality of care. Results of Operations Year Ended December 30, 2006, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 The Companys net earnings increased 27% to $109,891,000 in 2006 compared to $86,251,000 in 2005. Net earnings for 2006 include adjustments for approximately $1,994,000 of tax benefit for items relating to prior periods. 2006 net earnings also reflect the impact of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment, which requires the expensing of stock options. Adoption of SFAS 123R reduced 2006 net earnings by $11,746,000 (net of taxes). Net earnings for 2005 included an adjustment in the third quarter of 2005 related to a prior period for a tax benefit from the carry back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx Health Incorporated (Zynx) of $4,794,000 and the write off of acquired in process research and development in the first quarter of 2005 of $3,941,000, net of a $2,441,000 tax benefit. Adjusting for these items, 2006 net earnings increased 40% to $119,643,000 compared to 2005 net earnings of $85,398,000. Revenues The Companys revenues increased 19% to $1,378,038,000 in 2006 from $1,160,785,000 in 2005. The revenue composition for 2006 was $505,743,000 in system sales, $340,416,000 in support and maintenance, $492,828,000 in services and $39,051,000 in reimbursed travel. System sales increased 12% to $505,743,000 in 2006 from $449,734,000 in 2005. Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software, installation fees, transaction processing and subscriptions. System sales growth in 2006 was driven by strong growth of software, hardware and subscriptions. 17 Table of Contents Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 23% to $833,244,000 in 2006 from $677,664,000 in 2005. Support and maintenance revenues were $340,416,000 and $296,716,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Services revenues were $492,828,000 and $380,948,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware, professional services, excluding installation and remote hosting services. These increases were driven by strong performance in delivering Cerner Millennium solutions to clients and the continued success of the CernerWorks remote hosting services. Contract backlog, which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue, increased 27% in 2006 compared to 2005. This increase is due to a strong increase in new business bookings in 2006 compared to 2005. At December 30, 2006, the Company had $2,194,460,000 in contract backlog and $469,473,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $1,724,583,000 in contract backlog and $415,681,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2005. Cost of Revenues The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from hardware and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 21% of total revenues in 2006 and 22% of total revenues in 2005. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The decrease in the cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from strong levels of software sales and strong growth in services that do not have a high level of associated third party costs. Sales and Client Service Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 42% and 40% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in total sales and client service expenses to $578,050,000 in 2006 from $466,206,000 in 2005 was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses associated with the strong growth in our professional services and managed services businesses and an increased presence in the global market. In addition, 2006 sales and client service expense includes $11,412,000 of expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Software Development Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2006 and 2005 were $262,163,000 and $225,606,000, respectively. Capitalized software costs were $60,943,000 and $62,039,000 for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Amortization of capitalized software costs was $45,750,000 and $47,888,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively, leading to total recognized software development expense of $246,970,000 and $211,455,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in aggregate expenditures in software development in 2006 was due to continued development of Cerner Millennium solutions. In addition, 2006 software development expense includes $4,269,000 of expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses, professional fees and the transaction gains or losses on foreign currency. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% in both 2006 and 2005. Total general and administrative expenses were $95,881,000 and $81,620,000 for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company had net transaction gains on foreign currency of $3,764,000 for 2006 compared to $2,700,000 for 2005. 2006 general and administrative expense includes $3,340,000 of expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123R. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense was $697,000 in 2006 compared to $5,858,000 in 2005. Interest income increased to $11,877,000 in 2006 from $3,871,000 in 2005, due primarily to higher interest rates and a higher cash balance. Interest expense increased to $12,574,000 in 2006 from $9,729,000 in 2005, due primarily to a higher level of debt during 2006. Other Income, Net Other income was $2,074,000 in 2006 compared to $666,000 in 2005. Included in other income is income from office space leased to third parties. 2006 other income also includes a gain recorded in the first quarter of 2006 related to the renegotiation of a supplier contract that eliminated a 18 Table of Contents liability related to unfavorable future commitments due to that supplier. The Company was able to renegotiate the contract to eliminate certain minimum volume requirements and reduce pricing to market rates leading to the elimination of the previously recorded liability. The increase in other income in 2006 was driven by this gain and by higher lease income. Income Taxes The Companys effective tax rate was 34% and 36% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Tax expense for 2006 includes benefits of approximately $1,994,000 for adjustments relating to prior periods. Tax expense for 2005 includes an adjustment that reduced tax expense related to a prior period for a tax benefit from the carry back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx of $4,749,000. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rates were 36% and 40% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operations by Segment The Company has two operating segments, Domestic and Global. Beginning in 2006 we began allocating certain expenses related to our managed services that were previously classified as Other to the geographic segment to which they relate. As a result, the prior periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. The following table presents a summary of the operating information for 2006 and 2005 (in thousands): Operating Segments 2006 Domestic Global Other Total Revenues $ 1,166,662 207,367 4,009 1,378,038 Cost of revenues 251,574 39,224 172 290,970 Operating expenses 308,085 107,571 505,245 920,901 Total costs and expenses 559,659 146,795 505,417 1,211,871 Operating earnings $ 607,003 60,572 (501,408 ) 166,167 Operating Segments 2005 Domestic Global Other Total Revenues $ 1,043,804 113,317 3,664 1,160,785 Cost of revenues 238,096 17,189 (599 ) 254,686 Operating expenses 288,098 48,098 429,467 765,663 Total costs and expenses 526,194 65,287 428,868 1,020,349 Operating earnings $ 517,610 $ 48,030 $ (425,204 ) $ 140,436 Operating earnings in the Domestic segment increased $89,393,000 for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Total Domestic segment revenues increased $122,858,000 in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period driven by strong bookings growth. Costs of revenues were basically unchanged at 22% and 23% of total Domestic segment revenues for the year ended 2006 and 2005, respectively. Domestic segment operating expenses in 2006 increased $19,987,000 compared to 2005, primarily driven by spending to support growth in professional services and managed services. Operating earnings in the Global segment increased $12,542,000 for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Total revenues increased $94,050,000 in the 2006 period compared to the 2005 period. 2006 revenues included approximately $69 million from the Companys major contracts in London and Southern England. The revenues from these contracts did not change operating earnings as the Company is accounting for them using a zero margin approach of applying percentage of completion accounting until the software customization and development services are completed. Once software customization and development services are completed, which is expected in 2008, the remaining unrecognized portion of the fee will be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the arrangement, which expires in 2014. Costs of revenues were 19% and 15% of total Global segment revenues for the year ended 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in costs of revenues as a 19 Table of Contents percent of total revenues was driven by a much higher level of global hardware sales in 2006 compared to 2005. Operating expenses in the 2006 period increased $59,473,000 compared to the 2005 period primarily due to hiring personnel for the projects in England and supporting growth in other global regions. Operating losses in Other increased $76,204,000 for the year ended December 30, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005. Included in Other are revenues and expenses not tracked by geographic segment. Operating expenses increased $75,778,000 in 2006 compared to 2005. This increase in operating expenses is due to an increase in expenses such as software development, marketing, general and administrative, share based compensation expense and depreciation. Operating expenses in the 2005 period includes the write off of acquired in process research and development of $6,382,000. Year Ended December 31, 2005, Compared to Year Ended January 1, 2005 The Companys net earnings increased 33% to $86,251,000 in 2005 compared to $64,648,000 in 2004. Net earnings for 2005 included an adjustment in the third quarter of 2005 related to a prior period for a tax benefit from the carry back of a capital loss generated by the sale of Zynx of $4,749,000 and the write off of acquired in process research and development in the first quarter of 2005 of $3,941,000, net of a $2,441,000 tax benefit. Included in 2004 net earnings are an adjustment in the third quarter of 2004 related to a prior period vacation pay accrual that reduced net earnings by $2,076,000, net of $1,270,000 of tax, and a gain on the sale of Zynx, in the first quarter of 2004 that increased net earnings by $3,023,000. Excluding these four items, 2005 net earnings would have increased 34% to $85,443,000 compared to 2004 net earnings of $63,701,000. Revenues The Companys revenues increased 25% to $1,160,785,000 in 2005 from $926,356,000 in 2004. Revenues for 2005 included revenues from the acquired medical business division of VitalWorks, Inc. (VitalWorks), which closed on January 3, 2005 . Excluding the revenue from the medical business division of VitalWorks, 2005 revenues increased 18% over 2004. The revenue composition for 2005 was $449,734,000 in system sales, $296,716,000 in support and maintenance, $380,948,000 in services and $33,387,000 in reimbursed travel. System sales increased 28% to $449,734,000 in 2005 from $351,861,000 in 2004. Included in system sales are revenues from the sale of software, hardware and sublicensed software, installation fees, transaction processing and subscriptions, with each component growing at least 12% in 2005. This increase is due primarily to an increase in new business bookings and the inclusion of revenue from the medical business division of VitalWorks in 2005. Excluding revenue from the medical business division of VitalWorks, system sales would have increased 17%. Support, maintenance and service revenues increased 25% to $677,664,000 in 2005 from $542,414,000 in 2004. Support and maintenance revenues were $296,716,000 and $241,439,000 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Services revenues were $380,948,000 and $300,975,000 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in support, maintenance and service revenues are support and maintenance of software and hardware, professional services excluding installation, and managed services. These increases were driven by strong performance in delivering Cerner Millennium solutions to clients and the inclusion of revenue from the acquired medical business division of VitalWorks. Excluding revenue from the medical business division of VitalWorks, support, maintenance and service sales would have increased 19%. Contract backlog, which reflects new business bookings that have not yet been recognized as revenue, increased 45% in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase is due to an increase in new business bookings in 2005 compared to 2004. At December 31, 2005, the Company had $1,724,583,000 in contract backlog and $415,681,000 in support and maintenance backlog, compared to $1,191,170,000 in contract backlog and $347,662,000 in support and maintenance backlog at the end of 2004. Cost of Revenues The cost of revenues includes the cost of reimbursed travel expense, third party consulting services and subscription content, computer hardware and sublicensed software purchased from hardware and software manufacturers for delivery to clients. It also includes the cost of hardware maintenance and sublicensed software support subcontracted to the manufacturers. The cost of revenues was 22% of total revenues in 2005 and 21% of total revenues in 2004. Such costs, as a percent of revenues, typically have varied as the mix of revenue (software, hardware, services and support) components carrying different margin rates changes from period to period. The increase in the 20 Table of Contents cost of revenue as a percent of total revenues resulted principally from higher levels of hardware sales at lower than historical levels of margin for hardware. Sales and Client Service Sales and client service expenses include salaries of client service personnel, communications expenses and unreimbursed travel expenses. Also included are sales and marketing salaries, travel expenses, tradeshow costs and advertising costs. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 40% and 41% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in total sales and client service expenses to $466,206,000 in 2005 from $383,628,000 in 2004 was primarily due to an increase in personnel, personnel related expenses and increased presence in the global market. The decrease in this spending as a percent of total revenue reflects the Companys ability to get better utilization of its resources and leverage this spending over a larger revenue stream. Software Development Software development expenses include salaries, documentation and other direct expenses incurred in software development and amortization of software development costs. Total expenditures for software development, including both capitalized and noncapitalized portions, for 2005 and 2004 were $225,606,000 and $188,264,000, respectively. These amounts exclude amortization. Capitalized software costs were $62,039,000 and $58,912,000 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in aggregate expenditures in software development in 2005 was due to continued development of Cerner Millennium solutions. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include salaries for corporate, financial and administrative staffs, utilities, communications expenses, professional fees and the transaction gains or losses on foreign currency. These expenses as a percent of total revenues were 7% in both 2005 and 2004. Total general and administrative expenses were $81,620,000 and $63,327,000 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. General and administrative expenses for 2004 include an adjustment to increase the vacation pay accrual of $3,346,000, related to prior periods. Excluding the adjustment to increase the vacation pay accrual, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 6% in 2004.

The write off of in process research and development in 2005 is an expense resulting from the acquired medical business division of VitalWorks. Interest Expense, Net Interest income was $3,871,000 in 2005 compared to $3,022,000 in 2004. This increase is due primarily to higher interest rates, and a higher cash balance fed by cash collections. Interest expense was $9,729,000 in 2005 compared to $9,174,000 in 2004. Other Income, Net Other income was $666,000 in 2005 compared to $2,608,000 in 2004. Other income in 2004 included a gain on the sale of Zynx.

Beginning in 2006, we began allocating certain expenses related to our managed services that were previously classified as Other to the geographic segment to which they relate. As a result, the prior periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. Operating Segments 2005 Domestic Global Other Total Revenues $ 1,043,804 113,317 3,664 1,160,785 Cost of revenues 238,096 17,189 (599 ) 254,686 Operating expenses 288,098 48,098 429,467 765,663 Total costs and expenses 526,194 65,287 428,868 1,020,349 Operating earnings $ 517,610 $ 48,030 $ (425,204 ) $ 140,436 Operating Segments 2004 Domestic Global Other Total Revenues $ 862,276 62,426 1,654 926,356 Cost of revenues 187,114 7,582 1,652 196,348 Operating expenses 201,721 33,989 382,834 618,544 Total costs and expenses 388,835 41,571 384,486 814,892 Operating earnings $ 473,441 $ 20,855 $ (382,832 ) $ 111,464 Operating earnings in the Domestic segment increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended January 1, 2005. Total Domestic segment revenues increased 21% in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period driven by strong bookings growth. Cost of revenues were basically unchanged at 23% and 22% of total Domestic segment revenues for the year ended 2005 and 2004, respectively. Domestic segment revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses for 2005 included revenues from the acquired medical business division of VitalWorks, which closed on January 3, 2005. Domestic segment operating expenses in 2005 increased 43% compared to the 2004 period as a result of hiring additional personnel and the inclusion of expenses from the medical business division of VitalWorks. Operating earnings in the Global segment increased 130% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended January 1, 2005. Total revenues increased 82% in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. The Companys replacement of a competitor in the Southern region of England was a large contributor to the global success in 2005, with this contract contributing more than $14 million of revenue. The revenues from this contract did not change operating earnings as the Company is accounting for it using a zero margin approach of applying percentage of completion accounting until the Software Customization and development services are completed. Once software customization and development services are completed, which is expected in 2008, the remaining unrecognized portion of the fee will be recognized ratably over the remaining term of the arrangement, which expires in 2014. Other regions in our global business also had an outstanding year. On strength in the Middle East, Asia Pacific, France and Canada, Global segment revenue grew more than 50% excluding revenue from the Companys United Kingdom contract. Cost of revenues were 15% and 12% of total Global segment revenues for the years ended 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating expenses in the 2005 period increased 42% compared to the 2004 period due to hiring personnel for the higher level of activity outside the United States. Operating losses in Other increased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended January 1, 2005. Included in Other are revenues and expenses not tracked by geographic segment. Operating expenses increased 12% in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. This increase in operating expenses was due to an increase in expenses such as software development, marketing, general and administrative and depreciation in the 2005 period compared to the 2004 period. Operating expenses in the 2005 period included the write off of acquired in process research and development of $6,382,000. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys liquidity is influenced by many factors, including the amount and timing of the Companys revenues, its cash collections from its clients and the amounts the Company invests in software development, acquisitions and capital expenditures. The Companys principal source of liquidity is its cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents consist of U.S. Government Federal Agency Securities, short term marketable securities and overnight repurchase agreements. At December 30, 2006 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $162,545,000, short term investments of $146,239,000 and working capital of $444,656,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $113,057,000, short term investments of $161,230,000 and working capital of $391,541,000 at December 31, 2005. The Company generated cash of $232,718,000, $228,865,000 and $168,304,000 from operations in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash flow from operations increased in 2006 due primarily to a stronger performance in net earnings and increased collections of receivables. The Company has periodically provided long term financing options to creditworthy clients through third party financing institutions and has directly provided extended payment terms to clients from contract date. These extended payment term arrangements typically provide for date based payments over periods ranging from 12 months to five years. Pursuant to SOP 97 2, because a significant portion of the fee is due beyond one year, we have analyzed our history with these types of arrangements and have concluded that we do have a standard business practice of using extended payment term arrangements and have a long history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms for arrangements with similar clients, product offerings, and economics without granting concessions. Accordingly, we consider the fee to be fixed and determinable in these extended payment term arrangements and, thus, the timing of revenue is not impacted by the existence of extended payments. Some of these payment streams have been assigned on a non recourse basis to third party financing institutions. The Company has provided its usual and customary performance guarantees to the third party financing institutions in connection with its on going obligations under the client contract. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company received total client cash collections of $1,457,600,000, $1,200,595,000 and $937,600,000, respectively, of which approximately 8%, 7% and 6% were received from third party client financing arrangements and non recourse payment assignments. Days sales outstanding decreased from 89 days at the end of 2005 to 87 days at the end of 2006. Revenues provided under support and maintenance agreements represent recurring cash flows. Support and maintenance revenues increased 15% in 2006 and 23% in 2005, and the Company expects these revenues to continue to grow as the base of installed systems grows. Cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of short term investments of $161,230,000 in 2005, the acquisition of businesses of $13,731,000 in 2006 and $119,683,000 in 2005, capitalized software development costs of $61,223,000 and $62,523,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively and purchases of capital equipment, land and buildings of $131,478,000 and $100,583,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006, a source of cash in investing activities consisted of net proceeds from the sale of investment of $29,112,000. The Companys financing activities for 2006 primarily consisted of proceeds from the exercise of options of $21,704,000 and repayment of long term debt of $30,783,000. In 2005 the Companys financing activities consisted primarily of the repayment of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of $111,827,000 and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $51,744,000, and repayment of a revolving line of credit and long term debt of $91,848,000 and proceeds from a revolving line of credit of $70,000,000. In November 2005, the Company completed a 65,000,000 ($127,322,000 at December 30, 2006) private placement of debt at 5.54% pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Note Agreement is payable in seven equal annual installments beginning in November 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the Companys credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 30, 2006. In December 2002, the Company completed a $60,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $21,000,000 principal amount at 5.57%, are payable in three equal installments that commenced in December 2006. The Series B Senior notes, with a 23 Table of Contents $39,000,000 principal amount at 6.42%, are payable in four equal annual installments beginning December 2009. The proceeds were used to repay the outstanding amount under the Companys credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 30, 2006. In May 2002, the Company expanded its credit facility by entering into an unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks led by US Bank. This agreement was amended and restated on November 30, 2006 and provides for a current revolving line of credit for working capital purposes. The current revolving line of credit is unsecured and requires monthly payments of interest only. Interest is payable at the Companys option at a rate based on prime (8.25% at December 30, 2006) or LIBOR (5.32% at December 30, 2006) plus 1.55%. The interest rate may be reduced by up to 1.15% if certain net worth ratios are maintained. The agreement contains certain net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. A commitment fee of 2/10% is payable quarterly based on the usage of the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of credit matures on May 31, 2010. On January 10, 2005, the Company drew down $35,000,000 from its revolving line of credit in connection with the acquisition of the medical business division of VitalWorks. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) This amount was paid in full as of December 31, 2005. At December 30, 2006, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and had $90,000,000 available for working capital purposes. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 30, 2006. In April 1999, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement of debt pursuant to a Note Agreement. The Series A Senior Notes, with a $60,000,000 principal amount at 7.14%, were paid in full in 2006. The Series B Senior Notes, with a $40,000,000 principal amount at 7.66%, are payable in six equal annual installments which commenced in April 2004. The proceeds were used to retire the Companys existing $30,000,000 of debt, and the remaining funds were used for capital improvements and to strengthen the Companys cash position. The Note Agreement contains certain net worth, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage covenants and provides certain restrictions on the Companys ability to borrow, incur liens, sell assets and pay dividends. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 30, 2006. The Company believes that its present cash position, together with cash generated from operations and, if necessary, its lines of credit, will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during 2007. The following table represents a summary of the Companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments, excluding interest, as of December 30, 2006, except short term purchase order commitments arising in the ordinary course of business.

This commitment is not included in the above table. The construction is expected to be completed in 2007. The effects of inflation on the Companys business during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were not significant. 24 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 allows registrants to record a one time cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption to correct errors existing in prior years deemed to be material in the current year that previously had been considered immaterial. SAB 108 is effective for the fiscal year ending December 30, 2006. The Company assessed the impact of adoption of SAB 108 on its consolidated financial statements and determined there were no uncorrected misstatements deemed to be material under the new interpretive guidance provided in SAB108. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority. FIN 48 also prescribes a method for computing the tax benefit of such tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adoption of FIN 48 on its results of operations and its financial position and was required to adopt FIN 48 as of the first day of the 2007 fiscal year. Critical Accounting Policies The Company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the Companys historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving managements judgments and estimates. These significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, software development, concentrations, allowance for doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill. These policies and the Companys procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of the Companys accounting policies. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes its multiple element arrangements, including software and software related services, using the residual method under SOP 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98 4, SOP 98 9 and clarified by Staff Accounting Bulletins (SAB) 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements and SAB No. 104 Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force 00 21 Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00 21). Key factors in the Companys revenue recognition model are managements assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the Companys software whereas implementation services are not; and the length of time it takes for the Company to achieve its delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software. If the Companys business model were to change such that implementation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the Companys software, the period of time over which the Companys licensed software revenue would be recognized would lengthen. The Company generally recognizes combined revenue from the sale of its licensed software and related installation services over two key milestones, delivery and installation, based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation. Additionally, if the time to achieve the Companys delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software were to be accelerated or decelerated, its milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change. Software Development Costs Costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design, which is when the Company determines that technological feasibility has been established. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are available for general release, and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product. Because the development of projected net future revenues related to our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates, a significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the realizability of our capitalized software development costs. We historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in computing the net realizable value of our software solutions and the difference 25 Table of Contents between the net realizable value and the unamortized cost has grown over the past three years. We expect that trend to continue in the future. If we missed our estimates of net future revenues by up to 10%, the amount of our capitalized software development costs would not be impaired. Capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution. The Company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years. The five year period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized is an estimate based upon the Companys forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs. Historically, use of the Companys software programs by its clients has exceeded five years and is capable of being used a decade or more. The Company expects that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services. The pace of change in the healthcare information technology market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions, product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. As a result, the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment. Concentrations Substantially all of the Companys clients are integrated delivery networks, physicians, hospitals and other healthcare related organizations. If significant adverse macro economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the Company. The Companys access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could affect future results. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts If the creditworthiness of the Companys clients were to weaken or the Companys collections results relative to historical experience were to decline, it could have a material adverse impact on operations and cash flows. Goodwill The Company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value. The Company again assessed its goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of 2006 and 2005 and concluded that no goodwill was impaired. The Company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods. The Company completed nine acquisitions and one divestiture subsequent to June 30, 2001, which resulted in approximately $106 million of goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with SFAS 142. Goodwill amounted to $128,819,000 and $116,142,000 at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. If future, anticipated cash flows from the Companys reporting units that recognized goodwill do not materialize as expected the Companys goodwill could be impaired, which would result in significant write offs. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk At December 30, 2006, the Company had a 65,000,000 note payable outstanding through a private placement with an interest rate of 5.54%. The note is payable in seven equal installments beginning in November 2009. Because the borrowing is denominated in pounds, the Company is exposed to movements in the foreign currency exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Great Britain pound. Changes in the portion of the foreign denominated debt that was not designated as a hedging instrument were included in foreign currency transaction gains and losses and were immaterial in 2006.
