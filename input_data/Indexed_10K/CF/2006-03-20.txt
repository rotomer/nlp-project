Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. All references to "CF Holdings," "we," "us" and "our" refer to CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, Inc. except where the context makes clear that the reference is only to CF Holdings itself and not its subsidiaries. Overview Our Company We are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in North America. Our operations are organized into two business segments: the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business. Our principal products in the nitrogen fertilizer business are ammonia, urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution, or UAN. Our principal products in the phosphate fertilizer business are diammonium phosphate, or DAP, and monoammonium phosphate, or MAP. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2004, the most recent period for which such information is available, we supplied approximately 22% of the nitrogen and approximately 14% of the phosphate used in agricultural fertilizer applications in the United States. Our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern U.S. grain producing states. Our principal assets include: the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America (Donaldsonville, Louisiana); a 66% economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada (which we operate in Medicine Hat, Alberta, through Canadian Fertilizers Limited, or CFL); one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the United States (Plant City, Florida); the most recently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation plant in the United States (Hardee County, Florida); and an extensive system of terminals, warehouses and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States. Company History We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power. During the 1960s, we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1 billion in each of these decades. Through the end of 2002, we operated as a traditional supply cooperative. Our focus was on providing our pre IPO owners with an assured supply of fertilizer. Typically, over 80% of our annual sales volume was to our pre IPO owners. Though important, financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective. In 2002, we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance, rather than assured supply to our pre IPO owners, as our principal objective. A critical aspect of our new business model is a more economically driven approach to the marketplace. We now pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on enhancing our financial performance. One result of this new approach has been a shift in our customer mix. In 2005, our sales to customers other than our pre IPO owners and Western Co operative Fertilizers Limited (Westco), our joint venture partner in CFL, reached approximately 40% of our total sales volume for the year, which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002. 29 Concurrent with our new approach to the marketplace, we have been implementing other measures to improve the performance of our business. For example, we are focused on improving asset utilization, lowering our cost profile, and reducing our exposure to volatility in raw material and fertilizer prices. These measures, combined with our new approach to the marketplace and a leadership change in mid 2003, positioned us to capitalize on the improving industry conditions that began in the latter half of 2003. CF Holdings was formed as a Delaware corporation in April 2005 to hold the existing businesses of CF Industries, Inc. In August of 2005, we completed our initial public offering of common stock. Executive Summary We reported a net loss of $39.0 million in 2005 compared to net earnings of $67.7 million in 2004. Our results included several notable items, including a $99.9 million non cash charge to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to our initial public offering, a $6.1 million refund of Canadian income taxes, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to our accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations that reduced net earnings by $2.8 million, a $28.3 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and an increase of $11.1 million in Bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement costs related to revised engineering estimates. Our gross margin decreased $6.9 million to $209.2 million in 2005 compared to $216.1 million in the prior year. Increases in net sales in 2005, primarily due to higher average selling prices, were more than offset by increased raw material costs (primarily natural gas) and higher purchased product costs. Our net sales increased 16% to $1.9 billion in 2005 compared to $1.7 billion in 2004. The increase reflected higher average selling prices for both nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers, offset partially by lower sales volume. An increase of 109,000 tons of phosphate fertilizers sold in 2005 was more than offset by a decrease in nitrogen fertilizer sales volume of 174,000 tons, leaving total annual sales volume at 8.4 million tons in 2005 as compared to 8.5 million tons in 2004. We paid cash dividends of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter. A number of significant items affected our reported results for 2005 and our financial position as of December 31, 2005: In August 2005, we completed our initial public offering of common stock and listing on the New York Stock Exchange. We sold 47,437,500 shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately $715.4 million. In connection with our initial public offering, we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative. In the reorganization transaction, our pre IPO owners equity interests in CF Industries, Inc., now our wholly owned subsidiary, were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and 7,562,499 shares of our common stock. We did not retain any of the proceeds from our initial public offering. On August 16, 2005, we replaced our $140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a new $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility. On August 17, 2005, we repaid in full $235.6 million of our term notes, plus associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of $29.3 million, with cash on hand and by liquidating short term investments. In connection with our initial public offering, we also recorded a non cash charge to "Income tax provision" of $99.9 million to reduce to zero what remained of the gross deferred tax asset related to CF Industries net operating loss carryforwards as of August 16, 2005 (CF Industries last day as a cooperative). Those net operating loss carryforwards were generated from business conducted with our pre IPO owners while CF Industries was a cooperative. We also entered into a net operating loss agreement, or NOL Agreement, on August 16, 2005 with our pre IPO owners relating to the future treatment of the net operating loss carryforwards. Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally 30 determined that CF Industries net operating loss carryforwards can be used to offset taxable income generated in periods after CF Industries ceased to be a cooperative, we will pay our pre IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved. See " Factors Affecting Our Results" for additional discussion of this non cash charge and our NOL Agreement. Also, in connection with our initial public offering, we granted nonqualified options to purchase 2,720,100 shares of our common stock to our officers and certain key employees, and we issued 27,724 shares of restricted common stock to certain non management members of our Board of Directors. In the third quarter of 2005, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R) which requires us to recognize in our statement of operations the grant date fair value of all share based awards. As a result, the total share based compensation cost recognized for 2005 was $3.7 million, of which $3.2 million was recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses and $0.5 million was recorded as cost of sales. We expect the annual total compensation cost for share based awards existing as of December 31, 2005 to be approximately $7.0 million in 2006 and $6.0 million in 2007. We did not have share based awards prior to our initial public offering. See the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section later in this discussion and analysis for additional information on share based awards. During the third quarter of 2005, operating levels at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex were affected by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. The complex suffered only superficial damage from these storms and production was returned to planned levels approximately one week after facility shutdowns were implemented in connection with each storm. Total lost production resulting from both hurricanes was approximately 11,000 tons of shippable ammonia, 66,000 tons of urea and 52,000 tons of UAN solution. We compensated for lost production from both hurricanes through the usage of inventory and subsequent purchases of product. These hurricanes caused substantial damage to the natural gas production and distribution facilities in the region, affecting the supply and price of the primary raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. The ensuing volatility and high prices experienced in the gas markets significantly affected our operating rates during the fourth quarter. Recently, natural gas prices have moderated, returning to pre hurricane levels. Hurricane Katrina also affected the availability of barges that we use to transport urea and DAP/MAP on the Mississippi River. By the end of 2005, normal barge service was largely restored. Operating levels at our Plant City phosphate complex were also adversely affected by reduced sulfur supplies due to refinery closures following Hurricane Rita and by transportation disruptions due to hurricane activity in the Gulf. In light of these disruptions, we accelerated the timing of planned turnarounds at the Plant City complex to coincide with this period of reduced sulfur availability and transportation constraints. Production was restored to planned levels early in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Plant City complex suffered no weather related damage. We use our Forward Pricing Program (FPP) to reduce margin risk created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs. Through our FPP, we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. As our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us, we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost. Through the third quarter of 2005, we used natural gas derivative instruments, primarily futures and swaps, (derivatives) to fix the cost of natural gas under FPP orders. These derivatives were classified as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, and accounted for accordingly. The unrealized gains or losses on these hedges were deferred in other comprehensive income (OCI) and were recognized in our cost of sales at the same time as the cost of the underlying natural gas (hedged item). If any such hedges became ineffective, the gains or losses were recognized immediately in cost of sales. In the third quarter of 2005, unprecedented increases in natural gas prices led us to curtail operating rates at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and we began to satisfy FPP commitments with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases in addition to manufactured product. Recent instability in the natural gas market and our decision to supply FPP orders from sources other than production have reduced our ability to predict future natural gas requirements. Consequently, we ceased classifying derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, 31 beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result, future realized and unrealized gains or losses related to our derivatives will be recognized in operations as they occur. Cash flow hedges existing at the time we discontinued hedge accounting were de designated as cash flow hedges. Any subsequent unrealized or realized gains or losses associated with these existing hedges also will be recognized in cost of sales as they occur. The unrealized gain of $7.9 million in OCI as of December 31, 2005 relating to gains occurring prior to de designation of these hedges is expected to be recognized in cost of sales as the related forecasted transaction is recognized in the statement of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized in operations $9.3 million of unrealized losses on our derivatives as a result of reflecting changes in their market value (marking to market) during periods in which hedge accounting was not being applied. There is a probability of increased volatility in our operating earnings in future periods as a result of our discontinuance of hedge accounting, because future mark to market adjustments on our derivatives will directly impact operations as incurred. Despite our change in accounting treatment, the execution and attendant economic consequences of our hedging activities will not change in that derivatives will still be used to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on FPP sales and to take advantage of special situations in the natural gas market. However, because of our change in accounting treatment, gains or losses on natural gas hedges may not be realized in the same period as the FPP sale to which they relate. See Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of derivative financial instruments. We implemented FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN No. 47) in the fourth quarter of 2005. This interpretation of SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations requires us to recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. We have identified conditional AROs for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities. Consequently, we recognized an increase in ARO liabilities of $4.6 million, and an increase in deferred tax assets of $1.8 million resulting in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $2.8 million that decreased net earnings. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of asset retirement obligations. Key Industry Factors We operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our products are globally traded commodities and, as a result, we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality. Moreover, our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below. Global Supply & Demand Historically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short term fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption and farm sector income. Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying patterns of key consuming countries such as China, India or Brazil often play a major role in shaping near term market fundamentals. The economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs, government policies and global trade. Natural Gas Prices Natural gas is the most significant raw material required in the production of nitrogen fertilizers. For example, in 2005, our natural gas purchases accounted for approximately 56% of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers. North American natural gas prices have increased substantially and, since 1999, have become significantly more 32 volatile. In 2005, North American natural gas prices reached unprecedented levels due to the impact Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita had on an already tight natural gas market. Recently, natural gas prices have moderated, returning to pre hurricane levels. Our competitive position, on a worldwide basis, has been negatively impacted by the higher price of North American natural gas relative to the gas prices available to fertilizer producers in other regions of the world. Farmers Economics The demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. Global Trade in Fertilizer In addition to the relationship between global supply and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters. Changes in currency values alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world. Imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela are major exporters to North America. The domestic phosphate fertilizer industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of DAP/MAP. Historically, China has been a major source of demand for the U.S. phosphate fertilizer industry. Chinas reliance on imported phosphate fertilizers has decreased over the last three years as a matter of Chinese government policy to achieve self sufficiency in these products. However, growth in demand in other international markets, including Latin America, India and Pakistan, has partially offset declining imports by China. Political and Social Government Policies The political and social policies of governments around the world can result in the restriction of imports, the subsidization of domestic producers and or the subsidization of exports. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives. Factors Affecting Our Results Net Sales. Our net sales are derived from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize. The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, product purchases and distribution costs. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, maintenance, direct labor and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to buy ammonia for use in our phosphate fertilizer business and the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs prior to final shipment to customers. 33 In mid 2003, we instituted a margin risk management approach utilizing our forward pricing program (FPP), which allows us to manage some of the risks created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs. Through our FPP, we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. Through the third quarter of 2005, as our customers entered into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us, we locked in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative instruments. In the third quarter of 2005, due to the increased volatility of natural gas prices, we also began to satisfy FPP orders with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases in addition to manufactured product. See " Forward Pricing Program." As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our FPP, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and other payroll related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes, insurance and professional service fees. We expect to incur higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of the consummation of our initial public offering. These expenses include additional legal and corporate governance expenses, share based awards, salary and payroll related costs for additional accounting staff, director compensation, exchange listing fees, transfer agent and stockholder related fees and increased premiums for director and officer liability insurance coverage. Other Operating Net. Other operating net includes the costs associated with our Bartow phosphate facility (which has been largely idle since 1989) and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations. Bartow facility costs include provisions for phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond closure costs and costs associated with the cessation of operations. The term "other costs" refers to amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business, litigation expenses and impairment charges for goodwill. Interest Expense. Our interest expense includes the interest on our long term debt and notes payable, annual fees on our senior secured revolving credit facility and amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements. Interest Income. Our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Minority Interest. Amounts reported as minority interest represent the 34% minority interest in the net operating results of CFL, our consolidated Canadian joint venture. We own 49% of the voting common stock of CFL and 66% of CFLs non voting preferred stock. Two of our pre IPO owners own 17% of CFLs voting common stock, including GROWMARK which owns 9%. The remaining 34% of the voting common stock and non voting preferred stock of CFL is held by Westco. We designate four members of CFLs nine member board of directors, which also has one member designated by each of our two pre IPO owners that own an interest in CFL and three members designated by Westco. We operate the Medicine Hat facility and purchase approximately 66% of the facilitys ammonia and urea production, pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement. The management agreement and the product purchase agreement are each terminable by either us or CFL upon twelve month notice. Westco has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the remaining 34% of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement. To the extent that Westco does not purchase its 34% of the facilitys production, we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts. Under the product purchase agreements, both we and Westco pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases. However, the product purchase agreements also provide that CFL will distribute its net earnings to us and Westco annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from CFL. Our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to CFL in the event that CFL is unable to meet its debts as they become due. The amount of each advance would be at least 66% of the deficiency and would be more in any year that we purchased more than 66% of Medicine Hats production. We and Westco 34 currently manage CFL such that each party is responsible for its share of CFLs fixed costs and that CFLs production volume meets the parties combined requirements. The management agreement, the product purchase agreements and any other agreements related to CFL are subject to change with the consent of both parties. Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. Impairment of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents the write down of the carrying value of our investments in our joint ventures. Income Taxes. Upon completion of our IPO on August 16, 2005, we ceased to be a cooperative for federal income tax purposes. Our income taxes through that date reflected our consolidated tax provision or tax benefit as determined under our prior status as a nonexempt cooperative. As a cooperative, we could declare distributions in the form of patronage. Patronage is defined as the distribution of the excess of revenues over costs arising from business done with owners of a cooperative. Patronage is deductible for income tax purposes, provided that at least 20% of the total distribution is paid in cash. While we are no longer eligible for taxation as a cooperative, CFL will continue to operate as a cooperative for Canadian tax purposes. As such, CFLs earnings are, and will continue to be, available for distribution as patronage. Excluding any deductions related to patronage, as a cooperative we were subject to corporate rates as provided in the Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2004, CF Industries, Inc. had total net operating loss carryforwards of $311.3 million. A gross deferred tax asset of $124.3 million related to these net operating loss carryforwards is included on our December 31, 2004 balance sheet. Upon the completion of our initial public offering and the related reorganization transaction on August 16, 2005, we ceased to be a cooperative. During the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a non cash charge of $99.9 million to "Income tax provision" to establish a 100% valuation allowance against the gross deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards remaining as of August 16, 2005. The gross deferred tax asset related to CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards was generated from business conducted with our pre IPO owners when we were a cooperative for tax purposes. The valuation allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset would be realizable after we ceased to be a cooperative for tax purposes. We also entered into a net operating loss agreement, or NOL Agreement, on August 16, 2005 with our pre IPO owners that will determine the future treatment of the net operating loss carryforwards. Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that our net operating loss carryforwards can be used after we are no longer a cooperative, we will pay our pre IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved after the completion of our initial public offering from utilizing the net operating loss carryforwards related to our former cooperative status. These payments, if any, will be made only after it has been finally determined that utilization of the net operating losses has provided us with actual tax savings. The NOL Agreement does not require that we operate in a way that maximizes the use of our cooperative related net operating loss carryforwards. Costs incurred after completion of our initial public offering in pursuing a determination regarding the usability of these net operating loss carryforwards are borne by our pre IPO owners. 35   CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. In 2003, CFL, which operates as a cooperative, received a notice of proposed adjustment from the Canada Revenue Agency, or CRA, as a result of its audit of the tax years 1997 through 2000. The CRAs position was that we did not deal on an arms length basis with CFL and, therefore, the tax deduction for management fees paid by CFL to us for the years under audit should not be allowed. The CRA completed the audit in December 2004 with no resulting assessment for the years 1997 through 2004. The CRA has reserved the right to reopen the arms length issue for years after 2004. On May 13, 2005, the Canadian Income Tax Act was amended to disallow the deduction of certain patronage distributions paid after March 22, 2004 to non arms length parties. In the settlement of CFLs tax audit for the years 1997 through 2000, the CRA agreed that CFL has operated at arms length with CF Industries with respect to deductibility of patronage payments to CF Industries for the 2004 tax year. It is unknown what impact, if any, this legislation will have on CFLs deductibility of patronage distributions in future years. In 2004, the CRA initiated and we settled a Canadian income tax audit of our subsidiary corporation CF Chemicals, Ltd., or CFCL, through which we operate CFL, for the tax years 1997 through 2004. Completion of the audit resolved a transfer pricing issue involving the allocation of certain income from CFL to us and CFCL. The settlement reached with the CRA increased the allocation of the income to CFCL but did not have a material impact on our financial statements. CFL distributes all of its earnings from the sale of fertilizer as patronage dividends to its customers for fertilizer, including us. For Canadian income tax purposes CFL is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it paid to its customers, provided that certain Canadian income tax requirements are met. While CFL is not currently under audit by the Canadian tax authorities, CFL received a preliminary inquiry from the CRA in 2005 which questions whether CFLs past patronage distributions have met the requirements for full deductibility under Canadian income tax law. The past years that would be affected by this inquiry are 2002 through 2004. While CFL believes its allocation method complied with applicable law, CFL could be subject to Canadian income tax liabilities (exclusive of interest and penalties) for 2004, 2003 and 2002 of $26.1 million, $8.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively, and additional material Canadian income tax liabilities for future periods, including $18.0 million for 2005, if its allocation method were determined to fail to meet the requirements for deductibility under Canadian tax law. We have a 66% economic interest in CFL. Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Net of Taxes. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings (loss) of the joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest. 36 Results of Operations The following tables present our consolidated results of operations: August 17, 2005 through December 31, 2005 (in millions, except per share amounts) Post Initial Public Offering (IPO) Information Loss before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle $ (109.5 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of taxes (2.8 ) Net loss $ (112.3 ) Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding 55.0 Basic and diluted loss per share before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle $ (1.99 ) Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of taxes (0.05 ) Basic and diluted net loss per share $ (2.04 ) 37 Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2005 v. 2004 2004 v. 2003 (in millions, except per share amounts) Net sales $ 1,908.4 $ 1,650.7 $ 1,369.9 $ 257.7 $ 280.8 Cost of sales 1,699.2 1,434.6 1,335.5 264.6 99.1 Gross margin 209.2 216.1 34.4 (6.9 ) 181.7 Selling, general and administrative 57.0 41.8 38.4 15.2 3.4 Other operating net 14.1 25.1 1.6 (11.0 ) 23.5 Operating earnings (loss) 138.1 149.2 (5.6 ) (11.1 ) 154.8 Interest expense 14.0 22.7 23.9 (8.7 ) (1.2 ) Interest income (14.6 ) (5.9 ) (2.3 ) (8.7 ) (3.6 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 28.3 28.3 Minority interest 17.8 23.1 6.0 (5.3 ) 17.1 Impairment of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries 1.1 (1.1 ) 1.1 Other non operating net 0.1 (0.8 ) (0.6 ) 0.9 (0.2 ) Earnings (loss) before income taxes, equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 92.5 109.0 (32.6 ) (16.5 ) 141.6 Income tax provision (benefit) 128.7 41.4 (12.6 ) 87.3 54.0 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries net of taxes 0.1 1.6 (0.1 ) (1.5 ) Earnings (loss) before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (36.2 ) 67.7 (18.4 ) (103.9 ) 86.1 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of taxes (2.8 ) (2.8 ) Net earnings (loss) $ (39.0 ) $ 67.7 $ (18.4 ) $ (106.7 ) $ 86.1 Pro forma Earnings (Loss) Per Share(1) Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle $ (0.66 ) $ 1.23 $ (0.33 ) $ (1.89 ) $ 1.56 Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of taxes (0.05 ) (0.05 ) Basic and diluted net earnings (loss) per share $ (0.71 ) $ 1.23 $ (0.33 ) $ (1.94 ) $ 1.56 Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding 55.0 55.0 55.0 (1)Represents the pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share calculations as if the weighted average number of shares issued in the initial public offering were outstanding as of December 31, 2002.

Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 In 2005, the domestic nitrogen fertilizer industry, which benefited from tight global supply conditions through most of the year, was adversely impacted by rising natural gas prices in the third and fourth quarters of the year. The domestic phosphate fertilizer industry continued to show improvement due primarily to strong export demand earlier in 2005 and a tighter domestic supply/demand balance in the second half of the year due to hurricane related production curtailments. Our total gross margin decreased by approximately $6.9 million, or 3%, to $209.2 million in 2005 from $216.1 million in 2004 due largely to deteriorating nitrogen fertilizer market conditions in the latter part of the year, 38 partially offset by increased selling prices for phosphate fertilizers. The net loss of $39.0 million in 2005 included a $99.9 million non cash charge to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforwards generated during our pre IPO operations as a cooperative, a $6.1 million refund of Canadian income taxes, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to our accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations that reduced net earnings by $2.8 million, a $28.3 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt, a gain of approximately $14.0 million on our derivatives due to the early termination of hedge positions recognized in the third quarter, an increase of $11.1 million in Bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement costs related to revised engineering estimates, and $9.3 million of unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives. Net Sales Our net sales increased 16% to $1.9 billion in 2005 compared to $1.7 billion in 2004, due to higher average selling prices and an increase in phosphate fertilizer sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes. Nitrogen fertilizer prices in 2005 averaged 19% higher than the prices for similar products in the comparable period of 2004 reflecting strong demand and tight supply. Phosphate fertilizer prices in 2005 were 10% higher than corresponding prices in 2004, resulting primarily from strong international demand during the first half of the year and tight domestic supply during the second half of 2005. Our total annual sales volume was 8.4 million tons in 2005 as compared to 8.5 million tons in 2004, as a 109,000 ton increase in tons of phosphate fertilizers sold in 2005 was more than offset by a 174,000 ton decrease in the number of tons of nitrogen fertilizers sold. Cost of Sales Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $202 per ton in 2005 compared to $164 per ton in 2004, an increase of 23%, primarily due to higher natural gas prices as well as higher purchased product costs. Phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged $200 per ton in 2005 compared to $187 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 7%, mainly due to higher phosphate rock and ammonia costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 36% to $57.0 million in 2005 compared to $41.8 million in 2004. The $15.2 million increase in 2005 was largely due to increased administrative expenses related to completion of our initial public offering ($6.5 million), our long term incentive plan ($3.3 million), including expenses associated with the termination of the plan upon completion of our initial public offering, and compensation expense associated with our stock based awards ($3.2 million). Other Operating Net Other operating net decreased to $14.1 million in 2005 from $25.1 million in 2004. The $11.0 million decrease was due primarily to a $4.6 million decrease in costs related to the Bartow facility in 2005 compared to 2004, $2.2 million of gains realized in 2005 on the sales of a previously idled distribution terminal and excess land at our Bartow complex, and a $3.4 million provision recorded in 2004 for environmental remediation requirements at our Ahoskie, North Carolina nitrogen facility, which has been closed for 23 years. An $11.8 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 for future expenditures to treat water at Bartow and other Bartow environmental remediation requirements. Prior to that time, Bartow water treatment costs were expensed as incurred. A decrease in recurring Bartow water treatment expense in 2005 was partially offset by $11.1 million of adjustments to Bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement costs as a result of revised engineering estimates. The decrease in recurring Bartow water treatment expense in 2005 was due to the accounting treatment prior to the fourth quarter of 2004. For a detailed explanation of the accounting for water treatment costs at Bartow, please refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 39 Interest Net Interest net swung to $0.6 million of net interest income in 2005 from $16.8 million of net expense in 2004. Interest expense decreased 38% to $14.0 million in 2005 from $22.7 million in 2004, primarily due to lower average debt outstanding in 2005. The decrease in debt outstanding in 2005 was due to scheduled principal payments as well as the full repayment of our term notes. Interest income more than doubled to $14.6 million in 2005 from $5.9 million in 2004 as a result of higher average rates of return and, to a lesser extent, higher average balances of invested cash. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt The $28.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2005 consists of a $26.4 million penalty associated with the prepayment of our term notes and the write off of $1.9 million of unamortized financing fees related to our long term debt and our previous senior secured revolving credit facility. Minority Interest Amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFLs common and preferred shares. The decrease in 2005 was due to reduced CFL operating results. The deterioration in CFL operating results reflects weaker market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers, particularly in the latter half of 2005. Income Taxes Our income tax provision in 2005 included a non cash charge of $99.9 million recorded in the third quarter, as previously discussed, a $6.1 million refund of Canadian income taxes received in the third quarter as well as the normal provision for income taxes on earnings. Our effective tax rate (exclusive of the $99.9 million non cash charge and the $6.1 million refund of Canadian income taxes) was 38% in both 2005 and 2004. An increase in our 2005 effective tax rate due to the tax effect of expenses associated with our initial public offering, which are not deductible for income tax purposes, was offset by a tax benefit for adjustments for prior years tax returns. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle Net of Taxes In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded additional asset retirement obligations due to implementation of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations and recorded a related charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle reduced net earnings in 2005 by $2.8 million. For a discussion of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, please see the "Overview" section of this discussion and analysis. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 In 2004, the nitrogen fertilizer industry benefited from tight global supply conditions, while the domestic phosphate fertilizer industry strengthened due to strong export demand. Our total gross margin increased by approximately $181.7 million, or 528%, from $34.4 million in 2003 to $216.1 million in 2004 due largely to improved market conditions for both nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers. Net earnings improved to $67.7 million in 2004 compared to a net loss of $18.4 million in 2003, primarily reflecting stronger market conditions for all fertilizers. To a lesser degree, our increased profitability in 2004 was also due to our new approach to the marketplace and measures implemented to improve asset utilization and reduce costs. Net Sales Our net sales increased 20% to $1.7 billion in 2004 compared to $1.4 billion in 2003, largely due to higher average selling prices and a slight increase in sales volume. Our total sales volume increased 4% to 8.5 million tons in 2004 versus 8.2 million tons in 2003, due to stronger industry conditions and increased market penetration with customers other than our pre IPO owners and Westco. Nitrogen fertilizer prices in 2004 averaged 15% higher than the 40 prices for similar products in 2003, reflecting strong demand and tight supply. Phosphate fertilizer prices in 2004 were 21% higher than corresponding prices in 2003, resulting primarily from strong international demand. Cost of Sales Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $164 per ton in 2004 compared to $158 per ton in 2003, an increase of 4%, primarily due to higher natural gas prices. Phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged $187 per ton in 2004 compared to $177 per ton in 2003, an increase of 6%, mainly due to higher ammonia costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 9% to $41.8 million in 2004 compared to $38.4 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was largely due to increased expenses related to performance based management incentive compensation, which were offset partially by lower payroll costs resulting from staff reductions and lower outside consulting fees. Other Operating Net Other operating net increased from $1.6 million in 2003 to $25.1 million in 2004. The $23.5 million increase was due primarily to the following: a $10.5 million credit to Bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement costs (related to revised engineering estimates) in 2003 that did not recur in 2004; a $7.1 million charge recorded in 2004 for future expenditures to treat water stored in the Bartow phosphogypsum stack system; and a $4.7 million provision recorded in 2004 for other Bartow environmental remediation requirements. Other operating net in 2004 also includes a $3.4 million provision for environmental remediation requirements at our Ahoskie, North Carolina nitrogen facility, which has been closed for 23 years. Interest Net Net interest expense decreased 22% from $21.6 million in 2003 to $16.8 million in 2004. Interest expense decreased 5% from $23.9 million in 2003 to $22.7 million in 2004 primarily due to scheduled debt reduction, while interest income increased 157% from $2.3 million in 2003 to $5.9 million in 2004 as a result of higher average balances of invested cash. Minority Interest Amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFLs common and preferred shares. The increase in 2004 was due to improved 2004 CFL operating results. The improvement in CFL operating results reflects stronger market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers. Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Impairment of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2004 consisted of a $1.1 million write off of our investment in Big Bend Transfer Co., L.L.C., or BBTC, our joint venture to construct and operate a dry sulfur remelting facility in Tampa, Florida. We wrote off our investment in BBTC due to a fundamental shift in the economics of converting dry sulfur to liquid. In the intervening five years since the joint venture discussions were initiated, domestic supplies of attractively priced molten sulfur have increased substantially pursuant to increased production of cleaner grades of gasoline, which is expected to continue in the future. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2004 was 38% compared to 39% in 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 was due largely to lower effective state income tax rates. Our income tax provision for 2004 was $41.4 million compared to a net tax benefit of $12.6 million in 2003, primarily due to improved operating results. 41   CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Net of Taxes Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries net of taxes decreased from $1.6 million in 2003 to $110,000 in 2004, due to lower operating results of our CF Martin Sulphur joint venture. Segment Review Our business is organized and managed internally based on two segments, the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business, which are differentiated primarily by their products, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate. The following segment tables exclude information regarding our potash sales that were discontinued in 2003. Nitrogen Fertilizer Business The following table presents summary operating data for our nitrogen fertilizer business: Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2005 v. 2004 2004 v. 2003 (in millions, except as noted) Net sales $ 1,469.7 $ 1,273.9 $ 1,058.2 $ 195.8 $ 215.7 Cost of sales 1,296.8 1,080.1 999.6 216.7 80.5 Gross margin $ 172.9 $ 193.8 $ 58.6 $ (20.9 ) $ 135.2 Gross margin percentage 11.8 % 15.2 % 5.5 % Tons of product sold (000s) 6,429 6,603 6,309 (174 ) 294 Sales volume by product (000s) Ammonia 1,382 1,438 1,475 (56 ) (37 ) Urea 2,518 2,513 2,572 5 (59 ) UAN 2,483 2,593 2,228 (110 ) 365 Other nitrogen products 46 59 34 (13 ) 25 Average selling price per ton by product Ammonia $ 316 $ 278 $ 236 $ 38 $ 42 Urea 249 205 172 44 33 UAN 162 137 119 25 18 Cost of natural gas (per mmBTU) Donaldsonville facility $ 7.12 $ 5.60 $ 5.20 $ 1.52 $ 0.40 Medicine Hat facility 6.83 5.10 4.74 1.73 0.36 Average daily market price of natural gas (per mmBTU) Henry Hub (Louisiana) $ 8.86 $ 5.85 $ 5.44 $ 3.01 $ 0.41 AECO (Alberta) 7.26 5.04 4.72 2.22 0.32 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 63.0 $ 71.4 $ 69.9 $ (8.4 ) $ 1.5 Capital expenditures $ 44.4 $ 13.8 $ 14.2 $ 30.6 $ (0.4 ) Production volume by product (000s)(1) Ammonia(2) 2,778 3,356 3,082 (578 ) 274 Granular urea 2,065 2,322 2,378 (257 ) (56 ) UAN (28%) 2,256 2,640 2,276 (384 ) 364 (1)Total production of the Donaldsonville and Medicine Hat facilities, including the 34% interest of Westco, our joint venture partner in CFL. (2)Gross ammonia production, including amounts subsequently upgraded on site into urea and or UAN. 42 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Sales. Nitrogen fertilizer net sales increased 15% to $1.5 billion in 2005 compared to $1.3 billion in 2004, as higher average selling prices more than offset a decrease in sales volume. Ammonia, urea and UAN sales prices increased by 14%, 21% and 18%, respectively, in 2005 compared to the prior year. The increase in ammonia prices in the first half of 2005 was due to strong U.S. demand and tight supply conditions in midwestern U.S. markets. During the last half of 2005, the sharp increase in natural gas prices and the resulting drop in domestic production caused ammonia prices to increase. Urea prices increased in 2005 due to a tight world market caused by plant outages abroad, reduced domestic production resulting from higher natural gas prices and the impact of increased buying related to demand that had been deferred from previous periods. An improved overall nitrogen fertilizer market earlier in 2005, combined with tight supplies resulting from reduced domestic production later in the year because of higher natural gas prices, supported higher UAN selling prices in 2005. Our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 3% in 2005 to 6.4 million tons as compared to 6.6 million tons sold in 2004. Although both ammonia and UAN sales volumes decreased by 4% from 2004, urea sales volume was comparable to the prior year. The decrease in ammonia sales volume was primarily due to the loss of sales out of our Tampa, Florida terminal due to the loss of a key customer. UAN sales volume declined in 2005 due to reduced supply availability resulting from scheduled plant turnarounds and production and shipping disruptions caused by two hurricanes. Cost of Sales. Total cost of sales of nitrogen fertilizers averaged $202 per ton in 2005 compared to $164 per ton in 2004, an increase of 23%, largely due to higher natural gas prices, higher purchased product costs and unrealized mark to market losses, partially offset by the favorable impact of the early termination of certain natural gas hedge positions associated with our forward pricing program. The overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our Donaldsonville and CFLs Medicine Hat facilities increased by 29% in 2005 versus the cost in 2004, mainly due to continued tight market conditions for natural gas and the impact of the two gulf hurricanes. Purchased product costs were approximately $57.3 million higher in 2005 than in 2004, due to additional quantities purchased to meet sales commitments as well as the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices previously discussed. As previously mentioned, we recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in the third quarter of 2005, a gain of approximately $14.0 million which arose from the early termination of FPP related natural gas positions. We also recognized $9.3 million of unrealized mark to market losses on derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2005 as an increase in cost of sales due to our discontinuation of hedge accounting. See the "Overview" section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about the impact of accounting for our natural gas derivatives. During 2005, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer under our forward pricing program, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume. In 2004, we sold approximately 3.6 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 54% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the year. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Sales. Nitrogen fertilizer net sales increased 20% to $1.3 billion in 2004 compared to $1.1 billion in 2003, due to both higher average selling prices and an increase in sales volume. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume increased 5% to 6.6 million tons in 2004 compared to 6.3 million tons in 2003 due to stronger industry conditions and increased market penetration with customers other than our pre IPO owners and Westco. Declines in ammonia and urea sales volume of 3% and 2%, respectively, in 2004 compared to 2003 were more than offset by a 16% increase in UAN sales volumes. These strong overall UAN sales in 2004 resulted primarily from our continuing efforts to expand our customer base. Overall nitrogen fertilizer sales volume to customers other than our pre IPO owners and Westco increased from 28% of total nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2003 to 40% of total nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2004. Overall nitrogen fertilizer prices in 2004 averaged 15% higher than the prices for similar products in 2003 on a per ton of product basis, reflecting strong demand and tight supply caused largely by production outages at foreign producers in the face of continuing strong worldwide demand for nitrogen fertilizers. 43   CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Cost of Sales. Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $164 per ton in 2004 compared to $158 per ton in 2003, an increase of 4%, due to higher natural gas prices and higher purchased product costs. The overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our Donaldsonville facility and CFLs Medicine Hat facility increased by 8% in 2004 versus the cost in 2003 due to continued tight supply of natural gas and high prices for crude oil and other energy substitutes. Purchased product costs were approximately $16 million higher in 2004 than in 2003, due to the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices previously discussed. We instituted our forward pricing program in mid 2003. During 2004, we sold approximately 3.6 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 54% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the year. Phosphate Fertilizer Business The following table presents summary operating data for our phosphate fertilizer business: Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2005 v. 2004 2004 v. 2003 (in millions, except as noted) Net sales $ 438.7 $ 376.8 $ 309.8 $ 61.9 $ 67.0 Cost of sales 402.4 354.5 334.1 47.9 20.4 Gross margin (loss) $ 36.3 $ 22.3 $ (24.3 ) $ 14.0 $ 46.6 Gross margin percentage 8.3 % 5.9 % (7.8 )% Tons of product sold (000s) 2,009 1,900 1,892 109 8 Sales volume by product (000s) DAP 1,583 1,549 1,627 34 (78 ) MAP 426 351 252 75 99 Other phosphate fertilizers 13 (13 ) Domestic vs export sales of DAP/MAP (000s) Domestic 1,392 1,218 1,718 174 (500 ) Export 617 682 161 (65 ) 521 Average selling price per ton by product DAP $ 217 $ 197 $ 163 $ 20 $ 34 MAP 223 204 172 19 32 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 32.0 $ 35.1 $ 33.9 $ (3.1 ) $ 1.2 Capital expenditures $ 25.6 $ 16.2 $ 13.7 $ 9.4 $ 2.5 Production volume by product (000s) Phosphate rock 3,647 3,280 3,011 367 269 Sulfuric acid 2,507 2,455 2,279 52 176 Phosphoric acid as P2O5 978 967 892 11 75 DAP/MAP 1,945 1,933 1,797 12 136 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Sales. Phosphate fertilizer net sales increased 16% to $438.7 million in 2005 compared to $376.8 million in 2004, due to a combination of higher average selling prices and increased sales volume. Our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 2.0 million tons in 2005 represented an increase of 6% compared to 2004. Within our total phosphate fertilizer sales, sales of DAP/MAP to domestic customers increased by 14%, totaling 1.4 million tons in 2005, compared to 1.2 million tons in 2004. The increase in sales to domestic customers in 2005 as compared to 2004 is due to increased market penetration. Average phosphate fertilizer prices in 2005 increased by 10% compared to prices in 2004, due largely to strong international phosphate fertilizer demand in the first half of the year, as well as the impact of domestic industry production cuts occurring mainly over the second half of 2005. 44 Cost of Sales. Phosphate cost of sales averaged $200 per ton in 2005 compared to $187 per ton in 2004. The 7% increase was mainly due to higher phosphate rock costs and higher ammonia costs. Phosphate rock costs increased by 17% in 2005 compared to 2004 due primarily to increased costs resulting from less favorable mining conditions over the first six months of 2005. Ammonia prices increased by 10% in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting stronger global market conditions mainly in the last three quarters of 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net Sales. Phosphate fertilizer net sales increased 22% to $376.8 million in 2004 compared to $309.8 million in 2003, largely due to higher average selling prices. Although our overall level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 1.9 million tons in 2004 approximated 2003 sales, the composition of our 2004 sales shifted significantly, with substantial increases in export sales and sales to domestic customers other than our pre IPO owners. Overall export sales of DAP/MAP increased 324%, totaling 682,000 tons in 2004 compared to 161,000 tons in 2003. Phosphate fertilizer sales volume to customers other than our pre IPO owners increased from 18% of total phosphate fertilizer sales volume in 2003 to 47% of total phosphate fertilizer sales volume in 2004. Average phosphate fertilizer prices in 2004 increased 21% compared to 2003, due to strong aggregate demand. Cost of Sales. Phosphate cost of sales averaged $187 per ton in 2004 compared to $177 per ton in 2003, an increase of 6%, mainly due to higher ammonia costs in 2004, partially offset by lower maintenance costs. Compared to 2003, ammonia prices in 2004 increased approximately 24%, primarily reflecting tighter global market conditions. Maintenance costs at our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex were $6.4 million lower in 2004 than in 2003 due to a higher level of discretionary maintenance projects being completed in 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary sources of cash for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions are operating cash flow and our senior secured revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are operating costs, working capital needs, capital expenditures and dividends. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices for our products, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonality factors inherent in the business. Cash Balances As of December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents of $37.4 million, short term investments of $179.3 million and a $131.6 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our forward pricing program. As of December 31, 2004, the comparable amounts were $50.0 million, $369.3 million and $211.5 million, respectively. Our short term investments consist of available for sale auction rate securities that are reported at fair value. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, our operating cash flows, and credit available under our senior secured revolving credit facility are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2005 we had $192.6 million available under our revolving credit facility. Debt As of December 31, 2005, we had no long term debt, compared to $254.7 million of long term debt, including current maturities, as of December 31, 2004. Notes payable, representing amounts owed to the CFL minority interest holder stemming from shareholder advances, were $4.2 million as of December 31, 2005 compared to $4.1 million as of December 31, 2004. On August 16, 2005, we replaced our $140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a new $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate and is available through August 16, 2010. This facility is secured by working capital, certain equipment and the Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex. The credit facility provides up to $250 million, subject to a borrowing base, for working capital and general corporate purposes, including up to $50 million for the issuance of letters of credit. 45 There was $192.6 million of available credit under the senior secured revolving credit facility and no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit as of December 31, 2005. On August 17, 2005, we repaid in full $235.6 million of our outstanding term notes, plus associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of $29.3 million, with cash on hand and by liquidating short term investments. Capital Spending Capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base, to increase our capacity and to improve plant efficiency. In response to the difficult industry environment over the last several years, we had deferred non essential capital expenditures whenever it was possible to do so without compromising the operational integrity of our facilities or the safety of our employees. The $35.7 million increase in capital expenditures in 2005 as compared to 2004 related primarily to greater plant turnaround activity during the year. We expect to spend approximately $80 million on capital expenditures in 2006 and $70 million in 2007. These amounts include approximately $15 million in each year for capital expenditures at CFL, of which we are obligated to fund 66%. These amounts do not include expenditures related to opportunities for new investment, such as the project to construct a world scale ammonia and UAN manufacturing facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, which we are currently evaluating along with Terra Industries and ANSA McAL. Financial Assurance Requirements In addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate fertilizer business, we are subject to financial assurance requirements. The purpose of these requirements is to assure the government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate closure, post closure care and or reclamation required at our facilities. To date, these financial assurance requirements were satisfied without the need for any expenditure of corporate funds if our financial statements met certain criteria, referred to as the financial tests. However, pursuant to a 2005 amendment to Floridas regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure of phosphogypsum stacks, we intend to establish a cash deposit arrangement (fund) to meet such obligations to take advantage of a Safe Harbor provision of the new regulations. In 2006, we expect to contribute approximately $11.1 million to the fund earmarked to cover the closure, long term maintenance, and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks, as well as any costs incurred to manage our wastewater upon closure of the stacks. Over the next ten years, we expect to contribute between $2 million and $8 million annually to the fund. These funding estimates are based upon an assumed rate of return of 4% on invested funds. The amount of money that will accumulate in the fund by the end of the initial ten year funding period, including interest earned on contributed funds, is currently expected to be approximately $85 million. After the initial ten years of funding, contributions to the fund are expected to average approximately $0.4 million annually for the following 17 years. The fund is expected to reach approximately $170 million by 2032 assuming a 4% return on the invested funds. The amounts recognized as expense in our operations pertaining to phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. These expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the fund, which are based on the guidelines set forth in the Florida regulations. Ultimately, the cash in this fund will be used to settle the asset retirement obligations. Additionally, Florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities. We will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities, if and when we are able to expand our Hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted. The demonstration of financial responsibility in Florida may be provided by passage of a financial test. In the event we can not meet the financial test, we will have the option, based on current regulations, to demonstrate financial responsibility with a cash deposit arrangement. 46 Other Liquidity Requirements We offer a forward pricing program (FPP) to our customers under which product may be ordered for future delivery, with a substantial portion of the sales proceeds generally being collected before the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. See " Forward Pricing Program." While customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in 2005 and 2004, the level of sales under the FPP is affected by many factors, including current market conditions and our customers expectations of future market fundamentals. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we had approximately $131.6 million and $211.5 million, respectively, of customer advances on our balance sheet. The lower level in 2005 reflects the uncertainty that existed in the fertilizer market in the latter part of the year due to high natural gas prices, and the corresponding hesitancy of our customers to make commitments. There can be no assurance that we will transact the same percentage of our business under the FPP in the future. If the level of sales under the FPP were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease, and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Also, borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary. Due to our lack of history with this program and the volatility inherent in our business, we cannot estimate the amount of FPP sales activity. We paid cash dividends of $1.1 million on outstanding common stock during the fourth quarter and full year of 2005. This amount represents an annual rate equal to approximately $0.08 per share. We expect to pay quarterly dividends at such a rate for the foreseeable future. Under certain conditions, our new $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends. We also funded contributions to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans totaling $8.6 million, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2005. We expect to contribute $8.4 million to our pension plans in 2006. Cash Flows Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2005 was $137.2 million compared to $344.2 million in 2004. The $207.0 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily due to a $204.2 million increase in cash used to fund working capital. Net changes in working capital consumed $103.7 million of cash in 2005 compared to $100.5 million of cash generated by working capital reductions in 2004. During 2005, accounts receivable increased by $9.2 million, inventories increased by $8.9 million, net product exchange assets increased by $14.8 million and customer advances decreased by $79.9 million, resulting in a net use of cash of $112.8 million, which was partially offset by a $10.2 million decrease in margin deposits. The increase in accounts receivable was due to higher selling prices in December of 2005 versus December of 2004 and reduced sales volume shipped under the forward pricing program for which a substantial portion of the sales proceeds is generally received prior to shipment. The increase in inventories was due to higher per unit manufacturing costs and increased prices for purchased products, which were partially offset by reduced quantities held at December 31, 2005. The decrease in customer advances was primarily due to lower levels of forward sales on order as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004. The $100.5 million of cash generated by changes in working capital in 2004 was primarily due to a $45.5 million increase in customer advances, a $41.4 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $44.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in customer advances in 2004 was due primarily to higher levels of forward sales on order as of December 31, 2004 as compared to December 31, 2003. The decrease in accounts receivable was due primarily to an increase in sales volume shipped under the forward pricing program for which a substantial portion of the sales proceeds is generally received prior to shipment. The increased accounts payable and accrued expenses were largely related to higher trade credit obligations to our gas suppliers, reflecting higher natural gas prices. On the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, amounts owed and due from product exchanges have been reclassified from a net amount in inventory to current assets and current liabilities to conform to the 2005 presentation. On the consolidated statements of cash flows, corresponding adjustments have 47 been made to inventory and product exchanges net. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income (loss) or cash flow from operations. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2004 was $344.2 million compared to $136.9 million in 2003. The $207.3 million improvement in cash flows from operating activities in 2004 was due primarily to a $154.8 million improvement in operating earnings and a $24.6 million increase in cash generated by changes in working capital. Net changes in working capital generated $100.5 million of cash flow in 2004 compared to $75.9 million generated in 2003. In 2004, accounts receivable decreased by $41.4 million, accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $44.1 million and customer advances increased $45.5 million. The decrease in accounts receivable was due primarily to an increase in sales volume shipped under the forward pricing program for which a substantial portion of the sales proceeds is generally received prior to shipment. The increased accounts payable and accrued expenses were largely related to higher trade credit obligations to our gas suppliers, reflecting higher natural gas prices. The increase in customer advances in 2004 was due to expanded participation in our forward pricing program. The net positive effects from the above changes in operating cash flows were partially offset by a $30.0 million increase in inventories due to higher raw material prices and a $4.1 million increase in margin deposits due primarily to higher margin requirements. The primary reason for the $75.9 million source of cash in working capital in 2003 was the $126.1 million increase in customer advances due to expanded customer participation in our forward pricing program, which we instituted in 2003. The increase in cash flow from customer advances was partially offset by a $16.6 million increase in accounts receivable, a $21.1 million increase in margin deposits and a $10.7 million decrease in net product exchange liabilities. The increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to increased net sales, and the increase in margin deposits was related to natural gas hedges established as of December 31, 2003. Investing Activities Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 Net cash provided by investing activities was $139.3 million in 2005, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $309.3 million and $78.6 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additions to property, plant and equipment net accounted for $69.4 million, $33.7 million, and $28.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net sales of short term investments were $190.1 million during 2005 as compared to net purchases of $277.6 million and $53.1 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The $448.6 million swing in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to short term investments activity. The level of short term investments, generally auction rate securities that we liquidate as required over periods ranging from three to twelve months, is dictated by our current cash position and estimated future liquidity requirements. The increase in additions to property, plant and equipment net in 2005 was due primarily to a $23.6 million increase in plant turnaround costs incurred in 2005 as compared to 2004. The $18.6 million of proceeds from sale of unconsolidated subsidiary represents the cash realized from the July 15, 2005 sale of our interest in our CF Martin Sulphur joint venture to our joint venture partner, an affiliate of Martin Resource Management. Financing Activities Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 Net cash used in financing activities was $290.7 million, $61.3 million and $40.4 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Payments on long term debt of $254.8 million, $34.9 million and $33.4 million were made in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In conjunction with our initial public offering we repaid $235.6 million of our term debt and incurred the associated prepayment penalty of $26.4 million as previously discussed. At the end of 2005 and 2004, we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. Distributions to minority interest were lower in 2005, as CFLs 2005 net earnings are expected to be distributed in 2006, whereas the majority of CFLs 2004 net earnings were distributed in 2004. The $715.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the corresponding exchange of stock represent the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in the third quarter of 48 2005 and the subsequent payments to our pre IPO owners. See the "Overview" section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about our initial public offering. Obligations Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005: Payments Due by Period 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After 2010 Total (in millions) Debt Long term debt(1) $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Notes payable(2) 4.2 4.2 Interest payments on long term debt and notes payable(1) 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 1.2 Other Obligations Operating leases 18.6 13.2 6.3 4.5 1.3 0.2 44.1 Equipment purchases and plant improvements 6.3 1.1 7.4 Transportation(3) 18.6 16.3 14.7 15.1 15.6 243.6 323.9 Purchase obligations(4)(5)(6) 682.1 176.8 113.0 33.8 33.8 1,039.5 Total $ 725.9 $ 207.7 $ 134.3 $ 57.9 $ 50.7 $ 243.8 $ 1,420.3 (1)Based on debt balances and interest rates as of December 31, 2005. All our long term debt was repaid on August 17, 2005. See the "Overview" section of this discussion and analysis for further information on the transaction. (2)Represents notes payable to the CFL minority interest holder. While the entire principal amount is due December 31, 2009, CFL may prepay all or a portion of the principal at its sole option. (3)Includes anticipated expenditures under certain requirements contracts to transport raw materials and finished product between our facilities. The majority of these arrangements allow for reductions in usage based on our actual operating rates. Amounts set forth above are based on normal operating rates and contracted or spot prices, where applicable, as of December 31, 2005 and actual operating rates and prices may differ. (4)Includes minimum commitments to purchase natural gas based on prevailing NYMEX forward prices at December 31, 2005. Also includes minimum commitments to purchase ammonia, urea and UAN for resale in our markets and commitments to purchase ammonia and sulfur for use in phosphate fertilizer production. The amounts set forth above for these commitments are based on spot prices as of December 31, 2005 and actual prices may differ. (5)Liquid markets exist for the possible resale of the natural gas, ammonia, urea and UAN purchased for resale in our markets and ammonia and sulfur purchased for use in phosphate fertilizer production under the majority of these commitments, but gains or losses could be incurred on resale. (6)Purchase obligations do not include any amounts related to our financial hedges associated with natural gas purchases. 49   CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Other Long Term Obligations As of December 31, 2005, our other liabilities included balances related to asset retirement obligations (AROs) and environmental remediation liabilities and shutdown costs. The estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows: Payments Due by Period 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After 2010 Total (in millions) Asset retirement obligations(1)(2) $ 11.4 $ 3.9 $ 5.1 $ 5.8 $ 5.5 $ 527.2 $ 558.9 Environmental remediation liabilities and shutdown costs 1.1 0.8 0.5 0.4 0.4 4.8 8.0 Total $ 12.5 $ 4.7 $ 5.6 $ 6.2 $ 5.9 $ 532.0 $ 566.9 (1)Represents the undiscounted, inflation adjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the AROs. The corresponding present value of these future expenditures is $74.5 million as of December 31, 2005 and $52.7 million as of December 31, 2004. The increase in the present value of these future expenditures is due to recording changes in estimates on existing AROs as well as recording new conditional AROs, both as previously discussed. We also have unrecorded AROs at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex, at CFLs Medicine Hat facility and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included is reclamation of land and, in the case of Donaldsonville, reclamation of two effluent ponds. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in 2005 dollars is between $10 million and $12 million. We do not currently believe that there is a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities. Therefore, the table above does not contain any cash flows for these AROs. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of our AROs. As described in " Financial Assurance Requirements," we intend to set aside cash on a regular basis to a cash deposit arrangement (fund) established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack system. This fund will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the AROs pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack system. (2)Cash flows occurring after 2010 are detailed in the following table. The following table details the undiscounted, inflation adjusted estimated cash flows after 2010 required to settle the recorded AROs, as discussed above. Payments Due by Period 2011 23 2024 30 2031 34 2035 42 2043 47 After 2047 Total (in millions) Asset retirement obligations after 2010 cash flows $ 44.0 $ 20.1 $ 91.0 $ 85.0 $ 30.0 $ 257.1 $ 527.2 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 50 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when title is transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, or creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change as market conditions change. Inventory Valuation We review our inventory balances at least quarterly, and more frequently if required by market conditions, to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value. This review process incorporates current industry and customer specific trends, current operational plans for the inventory and historical price activity of inventory. If the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value, we would immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly. Upon inventory liquidation, if the actual sales price ultimately realized were less than our initial estimate of net realizable value, additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Remediation Liabilities Costs associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the Bartow and Plant City, Florida phosphate fertilizer complexes and costs associated with land reclamation activities at our Hardee, Florida phosphate rock mine are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. If the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated, asset retirement obligations (AROs) are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service. Costs associated with the cessation of operations at all of our facilities are accounted for in accordance with FIN No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. This interpretation requires us to recognize a liability for AROs for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. The obligations related to closure, reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded. The liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense. Accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time. The asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life. The aggregate carrying value of all of our AROs was $74.5 million as of December 31, 2005 and $52.7 million as of December 31, 2004. The increase in the aggregate carrying value of these AROs is due to recording changes in estimates on existing AROs as well as recording new conditional AROs, both as previously discussed. Environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies. Estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, site specific costs and currently enacted laws 51 and regulations. In reporting environmental liabilities, no offset is made for potential recoveries. All liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur. In accordance with GAAP, environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits. Changes in laws, regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements. The amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled $7.9 million as of December 31, 2005 and $11.7 million as of December 31, 2004. The actual amounts to be spent on AROs and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments and cost inflation, as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations. The estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Recoverability of Long Lived Assets We review the carrying values of our plant, property and equipment on a regular basis in accordance with SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. If impairment of an asset has occurred, an impairment charge is recognized immediately. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, prices, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The recoverability of the values associated with our long lived assets is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Deferred Income Taxes Our deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from tax net operating losses and temporary differences between income tax requirements and financial statement reporting. The most salient factors in this regard are typically depreciation and amortization, depletable mineral properties, retirement benefits and asset retirement obligations. We record a valuation allowance if we believe that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The eventual realization of the deferred tax assets recorded depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods. Sources of future taxable income include reversals of existing temporary differences and operating earnings to be generated in future years. Estimates involving the projection of future earnings are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, are highly susceptible to change. Changes in such projections can result in material adjustments to our consolidated income tax provision. As of December 31, 2004, CF Industries, Inc. had total net operating loss carryforwards of $311.3 million. A gross deferred tax asset of $124.3 million related to these net operating loss carryforwards is included on our December 31, 2004 balance sheet. Upon the completion of our initial public offering and the related reorganization transaction on August 16, 2005, we ceased to be a cooperative. During the third quarter of 2005, we recorded a non cash charge of $99.9 million to "Income Tax Provision" to establish a 100% valuation allowance against the gross deferred tax related to net operating loss carryforwards remaining at the date CF Industries, Inc. ceased to be a cooperative. That gross deferred tax asset related to CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards generated from business conducted with our pre IPO owners when we were a cooperative for tax purposes. The valuation allowance was required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset would be realizable after we ceased to be a cooperative for tax purposes. The valuation allowance was 100% of the gross deferred tax asset related to the net operating loss carryforwards remaining as of August 16, 2005. We also entered into a net operating loss agreement, or NOL Agreement, on August 16, 2005 with our pre IPO owners relating to the future treatment of the net operating loss carryforwards. Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that our net operating loss carryforwards can be used after we are no longer a cooperative, we will 52 pay our pre IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved after the completion of the initial public offering as a result of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards related to our former cooperative status. Pension Assets and Liabilities Pension assets and liabilities are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Our projected benefit obligation (PBO) related to our pension plans was $232.3 million at December 31, 2005, which was $45.6 million higher than pension plan assets. The December 31, 2005 PBO was computed based on a 5.50% discount rate, which was based on yields for high quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. If the discount rate used to compute the PBO was lower by 50 basis points, our PBO would have been approximately $18 million higher than the amount previously discussed. Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute the PBO was higher by 50 basis points, our PBO would have been approximately $16 million lower The discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2005 was 5.75% and was the discount rate used to compute the PBO at December 31, 2004. If the discount rate used to compute 2005 pension expense was lower by 50 basis points, 2005 pension expense would have been approximately $1.7 million higher than the amount calculated. Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute 2005 pension expense was higher by 50 basis points, 2005 pension expense would have been approximately $1.5 million lower than the amount calculated. Our net benefit obligation, after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate. The 8.0% expected long term rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non equity investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding periods. If the expected long term rate of return on assets was higher by 50 basis points, pension expense for 2005 would have been $0.9 million lower. Conversely, if the expected long term rate of return on assets was lower by 50 basis points, pension expense for 2005 would have been $0.9 million higher. Retiree Medical Benefits Retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions, including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense. Share Based Payments Costs associated with share based payments are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment, (SFAS 123R) which requires us to recognize in our statement of operations the grant date fair value of all share based awards. The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. We accrue cost on the straight line method. As a result, total compensation cost recognized for 2005 was $3.7 million. As of December 31, 2005, there was approximately $15.2 million and $0.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over 2.6 and 0.4 years, respectively. See Notes 3 and 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of share based payments. 53 Forward Pricing Program (FPP) In mid 2003, we instituted a program that has reduced the risk inherent in the relationship between volatile fertilizer prices and natural gas costs for product that we manufacture. Our basic concept (principally applied to nitrogen fertilizers) is to fix the price of our principal raw material, natural gas, coincident with the establishment of the fertilizer sales price, which often occurs months in advance of shipment. Customer advances, which typically represent a substantial portion of the contracts sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped. As is the case for all of our sales transactions, revenue is recognized when title transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers. Through the third quarter of 2005, we used derivative instruments, primarily futures and swaps, to fix the natural gas prices for product sold under our forward pricing program. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, these instruments were classified as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, and accounted for accordingly. The gains or losses of these hedges were deferred in other comprehensive income and were recognized in operations when the hedged item affected earnings. If any such hedges become ineffective, the gains or losses were recognized immediately in operations. In the third quarter of 2005, unprecedented increases in natural gas prices led us to curtail operating rates at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities, and we began to satisfy FPP commitments with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases in addition to manufactured product. These factors have reduced our ability to predict future natural gas requirements. Consequently, we no longer classify derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result, future realized and unrealized gains or losses related to the derivatives will be recognized in operations as they occur. There is a probability of increased volatility in our operating earnings in future periods as a result of our discontinuing hedge accounting, because future mark to market adjustments on our derivatives will directly impact operations as incurred. Despite the change in accounting treatment, the execution and attendant economic consequences of our hedging activities will not change in that derivatives will still be used to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on FPP sales. However, because of our change in accounting treatment, gains or losses on natural gas hedges may not be realized in the same period as the FPP sale to which they relate. See Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10 K for further discussion of derivative financial instruments. Some of our customers have been able to apply the forward pricing concept in their dealings with their customers, thereby further integrating their business with ours. For example, our two largest customers, Agriliance and GROWMARK, have electronically integrated their forward pricing offerings with ours. As a result of the success of our FPP, we have been able, under recent market conditions, both to reduce risks and to add more predictability in our business. During 2005, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume, and approximately 718,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, representing approximately 36% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume, under the FPP. In 2004, we sold approximately 3.6 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer, representing approximately 54% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume, and approximately 273,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, representing approximately 14% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume, under the FPP. During 2003, we sold approximately 1.6 million tons of fertilizer, representing approximately 19% of our sales volume, under the FPP. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we had approximately 1.2 million tons of product and 1.9 million tons of product, respectively, committed to be sold under this program. The majority of these amounts were scheduled to ship within 150 days of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our FPP, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. 54 Participation in the FPP is affected by market conditions and our customers expectations. There can be no assurance that we will transact the same percentage of our business under the FPP in the future. Should the level of participation decrease, there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods. Discussion of Seasonality Impacts on Operations Our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and or our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Interest Rate Fluctuations Borrowings under variable rate notes payable bear a current market rate of interest such that we are subject to interest rate risk on these borrowings. The revolving credit facility bears a similar risk, but as of December 31, 2005, there were no borrowings under this facility. As of December 31, 2005, a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our floating rate loans, which totaled $4.2 million, would result in a $42,000 change in pretax earnings (loss) on an annual basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar as a result of our 66% economic interest and our 49% common equity interest in CFL. At the present time, we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to CFL. Commodity Prices Our net sales, cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to the nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer sales not made under the forward pricing program are sensitive to changes in nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials. A $1.00 per mmBTU change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia by approximately $33. We use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen fertilizer products. Because natural gas prices are volatile, our Natural Gas Acquisition Policy includes the objective of providing protection against significant adverse natural gas price movements. We manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years. The derivative instruments currently used are swaps and futures. These contracts reference primarily NYMEX futures contract prices, which represent fair value at any given time. The related contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. As of December 31, 2005, we hedged approximately 14.1 million mmBTUs of natural gas, most of which related to sales contracted to be sold through our forward pricing program as of December 31, 2005. We also establish derivative positions in natural gas that are unrelated to forward pricing program contracts if we consider it appropriate to do so. 55 Through the third quarter of 2005, we designated, documented and assessed accounting for hedge relationships, which resulted primarily in cash flow hedges that required us to record the derivatives as assets and liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss of an effective cash flow hedge was deferred in other comprehensive income (loss) until the month after the hedged natural gas was used to manufacture inventoried products, which approximated the period of inventory turns of upgraded products and the release of the cost of the hedged gas to cost of sales. Ineffective hedge gains and losses were recorded immediately in cost of sales. Recent instability in the natural gas market and our decision to supply FPP orders from sources other than production have reduced our ability to predict future natural gas requirements. Consequently, we no longer classify derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result, while the derivatives are still carried at their fair value on the balance sheet, future unrealized gains or losses related to the derivatives will be recognized in operations as they occur. We purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of DAP and MAP. We attempt to include any price fluctuations related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products, but there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered. We enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices. A $10 per related ton change in the cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change DAP production cost by $2.10 per ton and $3.80 per ton, respectively. We also purchase ammonia, urea and UAN to augment or replace production at our facilities. 56   CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
