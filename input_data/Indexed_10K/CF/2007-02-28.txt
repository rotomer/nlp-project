Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. All references to CF Holdings, we, us and our refer to CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, Inc. except where the context makes clear that the reference is only to CF Holdings itself and not its subsidiaries. All references to our pre IPO owners refer to the eight stockholders of CF Industries, Inc. prior to the completion of our initial public offering and reorganization transaction on August 16, 2005. Overview Our Company We are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in North America. Our operations are organized into two business segments: the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business. Our principal products in the nitrogen fertilizer business are ammonia, urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution, or UAN. Our principal products in the phosphate fertilizer business are diammonium phosphate, or DAP, and monoammonium phosphate, or MAP. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2005, the most recent period for which such information is available, we supplied approximately 24% of the nitrogen and approximately 12% of the phosphate used in agricultural fertilizer applications in the United States. Our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern U.S. grain producing states. Our principal assets include: the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America (Donaldsonville, Louisiana); a 66% economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada (which we operate in Medicine Hat, Alberta, through Canadian Fertilizers Limited, or CFL, a consolidated variable interest entity); one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the United States (Plant City, Florida); the most recently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation plant in the United States (Hardee County, Florida); and an extensive system of terminals, warehouses and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States. Company History We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power. During the 1960s, we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1 billion in each of these decades. Through the end of 2002, we operated as a traditional supply cooperative. Our focus was on providing our pre IPO owners with an assured supply of fertilizer. Typically, over 80% of our annual sales volume was to our pre IPO owners. Though important, financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective. 29 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. In 2002, we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance, rather than assured supply to our pre IPO owners, as our principal objective. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace. Under the new business model, we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance. One result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix. By 2006, our sales to customers other than our pre IPO owners and Western Co operative Fertilizers Limited (Westco), our joint venture partner in CFL, reached approximately 46% of our total sales volume for the year, which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002. CF Holdings was formed as a Delaware corporation in April 2005 to hold the existing businesses of CF Industries, Inc. In August of 2005, we completed our initial public offering of common stock. Executive Summary We reported net earnings of $33.3 million in 2006 compared to a net loss of $39.0 million in 2005. Our results for 2006 included a net $30.7 million pre tax mark to market loss on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $21.6 million for adjustments to our asset retirement obligations (AROs) and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex. The net loss of $39.0 million in 2005 included a $99.9 million charge to the income tax provision to record a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards generated during pre IPO operations, a $28.3 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, a net $9.3 million pre tax mark to market loss on natural gas derivatives and a $12.8 million pre tax charge to AROs primarily related to our Bartow, Florida complex. Our gross margin decreased $62.0 million to $147.2 million in 2006 compared to $209.2 million in 2005. The decline in gross margin resulted primarily from unfavorable variances related to natural gas costs and higher phosphate raw material costs, partially offset by higher average selling prices for ammonia as well as higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices. Our net sales were $1.9 billion for both 2006 and 2005. Higher average selling prices for ammonia and phosphate fertilizers in 2006 were offset by lower nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes. Our total sales volume of 8.4 million tons for 2006 approximated the volume of tons sold in 2005. We paid cash dividends of $4.4 million in 2006. The following significant items affected the comparability of our reported results for 2006 and our financial position as of December 31, 2006: On August 16, 2005, we completed our IPO of common stock. We sold 47,437,500 shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately $715.4 million. We did not retain any of the proceeds from our IPO. In connection with our IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction in which CF Industries, Inc. ceased to be a cooperative and became our wholly owned subsidiary. In the reorganization transaction, all of the equity interests in CF Industries, Inc. were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the IPO and 7,562,499 shares of our common stock. In connection with our IPO, we also recorded a charge to the income tax provision of $99.9 million to reduce to zero what remained of the gross deferred tax asset related to CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards as of August 16, 2005 (CF Industries, Inc.s last day as a cooperative). Those net operating loss carryforwards were generated from business conducted with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners while CF Industries, Inc. was a cooperative. In connection with our IPO, we entered into an NOL agreement with the pre IPO owners of CF Industries, Inc. which provides that in the event that it is finally determined by the applicable taxing jurisdictions that CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO NOLs can be utilized, 30 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. we will pay the pre IPO owners an amount equal to the federal and state income taxes saved by the utilization of the pre IPO NOLs. See Notes 12 and 30 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of the NOL agreement. In August of 2005, we replaced our $140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility. In August of 2005, we repaid in full $235.6 million of our term notes, plus associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of $29.3 million, with cash on hand and by liquidating short term investments. Prior thereto, we made principal payments of $0.7 million and $10.0 million on their scheduled maturity dates. In connection with these transactions, we incurred a net $17.1 million charge (after taxes) related to the prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of our long term debt ($16.0 million) and termination of a long term incentive plan ($1.1 million) upon completion of our IPO. We also incurred a non cash charge of $1.1 million (after taxes) related to the write off of unamortized financing fees related to our previous senior secured revolving credit facility and long term debt. Also, in connection with our IPO, our board of directors adopted a plan under which we grant stock based awards to our officers, employees and non employee directors. In both 2006 and 2005 (in connection with the IPO), stock based awards were granted under this plan. In the third quarter of 2005, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R Share Based Payment which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all stock based awards. As a result, the total stock based compensation cost recognized for 2006 and 2005 was $8.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Most of the stock based compensation cost was recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. We did not have stock based awards prior to our initial public offering. See the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section later in this discussion and analysis for additional information on stock based compensation. Hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico region during the latter portion of 2005 significantly affected the domestic fertilizer industry. These hurricanes caused substantial damage to the natural gas production and distribution facilities in the region, affecting the supply and price of natural gas, the primary raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. By the end of the first quarter of 2006, natural gas prices had moderated, returning to approximately pre hurricane levels. These storms also affected the availability of barges used to transport urea and DAP/MAP on the Mississippi River and adversely affected the supply of sulfur, a raw material used in the production of phosphate fertilizers, by causing refinery closures and transportation disruptions. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we ceased classifying natural gas derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities. As a result, realized and unrealized gains or losses related to our derivatives are now recognized in operations as they occur. Cash flow hedges existing at the time we discontinued hedge accounting were de designated as cash flow hedges. During 2006, we recognized a net $30.7 million pre tax mark to market loss on natural gas derivatives in cost of sales compared to a net $9.3 million pre tax mark to market loss in 2005. Despite our change in accounting treatment, the execution and attendant economic consequences of our hedging activities have not changed, in that derivatives are still being used to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on forward pricing program (FPP) sales. However, because of our change in accounting treatment, gains or losses on natural gas hedges may not be realized in the same period as the FPP sale to which they relate. We also establish natural gas derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our FPP. See Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of derivative financial instruments. 31 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. We implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN No. 47) in the fourth quarter of 2005. This interpretation of SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations requires us to recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. We identified conditional AROs for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities. Consequently, we recognized an increase in ARO liabilities of $4.6 million, and an increase in deferred tax assets of $1.8 million resulting in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $2.8 million that decreased net earnings. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of asset retirement obligations. Key Industry Factors We operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our products are globally traded commodities and, as a result, we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality. Moreover, our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below. Global Supply & Demand Historically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short term fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption and farm sector income. Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying patterns of key consuming countries such as China, India or Brazil often play a major role in shaping near term market fundamentals. The economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs, government policies and global trade. Natural Gas Prices Natural gas is the most significant raw material required in the production of nitrogen fertilizers. For example, in 2006, our natural gas purchases accounted for approximately 54% of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers. North American natural gas prices have increased substantially and, since 1999, have become significantly more volatile. In 2005, North American natural gas prices reached unprecedented levels due to the impact Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita had on an already tight natural gas market. By the end of the first quarter of 2006, natural gas prices moderated, returning to pre hurricane levels. Our competitive position, on a worldwide basis, has been negatively impacted by the higher price of North American natural gas relative to the gas prices available to fertilizer producers in other regions of the world. Farmers Economics The demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. Fertilizer demand is expected to increase in the future in response to increased corn acreage required to support the growing ethanol industry. 32 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Global Trade in Fertilizer In addition to the relationship between global supply and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters. Changes in currency values alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world. Imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela are major exporters to North America. The domestic phosphate fertilizer industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of DAP/MAP. Historically, China has been a major source of demand for the U.S. phosphate fertilizer industry. Chinas reliance on imported phosphate fertilizers has decreased over the last three years as a matter of Chinese government policy to achieve self sufficiency in these products. However, growth in demand in other international markets, including Latin America, India and Pakistan, has partially offset declining imports by China. Political and Social Government Policies The political and social policies of governments around the world can result in the restriction of imports, the subsidization of domestic producers and or the subsidization of exports. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives. Factors Affecting Our Results Net Sales. Our net sales are derived from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize. The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, product purchases and distribution costs. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, maintenance, direct labor and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to buy ammonia for use in our phosphate fertilizer business and the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs prior to final shipment to customers. In mid 2003, we instituted a margin risk management approach utilizing our forward pricing program (FPP), which allows us to manage some of the risks created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs. Through our FPP, we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. As our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us, we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative instruments. In the third quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, due to the increased volatility of natural gas prices, we fulfilled a significant amount of FPP orders with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases rather than with manufactured product. See Forward Pricing Program. As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our FPP, often 33 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and other payroll related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes, insurance and professional service fees. Our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of the consummation of our IPO. These expenses include additional legal and corporate governance expenses, stock based awards, salary and payroll related costs for additional accounting staff, director compensation, exchange listing fees, transfer agent and stockholder related fees and increased premiums for director and officer liability insurance coverage. Other Operating Net. Other operating net includes the costs associated with our closed Bartow phosphate facility and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations. Bartow facility costs include provisions for phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond closure costs, water treatment costs and costs associated with the cessation of operations. The term other costs refers to amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business, litigation expenses, gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets and impairment charges for goodwill. Interest Expense. Our interest expense includes the interest on our long term debt and notes payable, annual fees on our senior secured revolving credit facility and amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements. Interest Income. Our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. Minority Interest. Amounts reported as minority interest represent the 34% minority interest in the net operating results of CFL, our consolidated Canadian joint venture. We own 49% of the voting common stock of CFL and 66% of CFLs non voting preferred stock. Two of our pre IPO owners own 17% of CFLs voting common stock, including GROWMARK which owns 9%. The remaining 34% of the voting common stock and non voting preferred stock of CFL is held by Westco. We designate four members of CFLs nine member board of directors, which also has one member designated by each of our two pre IPO owners that own an interest in CFL and three members designated by Westco. We operate the Medicine Hat facility and purchase approximately 66% of the facilitys ammonia and urea production, pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement. Both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either us or CFL upon a twelve month notice. Westco has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the remaining 34% of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement. To the extent that Westco does not purchase its 34% of the facilitys production, we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts. Since 1995, however, Westco has purchased at least 34% of the facilitys production each year. Under the product purchase agreements, both we and Westco pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases. However, the product purchase agreements also provide that CFL will distribute its net earnings to us and Westco annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from CFL. The distributions to Westco are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, as we consider these payments to be similar to dividends. Our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to CFL in the event that CFL is unable to meet its debts as they become due. The amount of each advance would be at least 66% of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66% of Medicine Hats production. We and Westco currently manage CFL such that each party is responsible for its share of CFLs fixed costs and that CFL s production volume meets the parties combined requirements. The management agreement, the product 34 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. purchase agreements and any other agreements related to CFL are subject to change with the consent of both parties. Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. Impairment of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents the write down of the carrying value of our investments in our joint ventures. Income Taxes. Upon the completion of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes. On the date of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. had a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) generated from business conducted with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners. These net operating loss carryforwards totaled $250 million, with expirations ranging from 2021 through 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a charge of $99.9 million to establish a 100% valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these NOLs. The valuation allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized since CF Industries, Inc. is no longer a cooperative for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a net operating loss agreement with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners (NOL Agreement) relating to the future treatment of the pre IPO NOLs. Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the IPO, we will pay to CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved. CFL operates as a cooperative for Canadian income tax purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its customers, including CF Industries, Inc. For Canadian income tax purposes, CFL is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it distributes to its customers, provided that certain requirements are met. As a result, CFL records no income tax provision. On May 13, 2005, the Canadian Income Tax Act was amended to disallow the deduction of certain patronage distributions paid after March 22, 2004 to non arms length persons. In the settlement of CFLs audit for the tax years 1997 through 2000, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) agreed that CFL has operated at arms length with CF Industries with respect to the deductibility of patronage payments to CF Industries for the 2004 taxation year, and the Company believes it has continued to operate on an arms length basis. Although CFL is not currently under audit by the Canadian tax authorities, CFL received a preliminary inquiry from the CRA in 2005, which questioned whether CFLs past patronage distributions had met the requirements for full deductibility under Canadian income tax law. While CFL believes its distributions complied with applicable law, CFL could be subject to material Canadian income tax liabilities if its distributions were determined to fail to meet the requirements for deductibility under Canadian tax law. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries Net of Taxes. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest. 35 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

The first half of 2006 was unfavorably impacted by high natural gas prices during the first quarter of the year and reduced demand during the spring planting season. Results during 2006 for our phosphate fertilizer business were affected positively by increased domestic demand and relatively balanced international supply/demand conditions. Our total gross margin decreased by approximately $62.0 million, or 30%, to $147.2 million for 2006 compared to a gross margin of $209.2 million for 2005. The net earnings of $33.3 million for 2006 included a pre tax charge of $30.7 million for unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $21.6 million for adjustments to AROs and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex. The net loss of $39.0 million for 2005 included a $99.9 million charge to record a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards generated during pre IPO operations, a $28.3 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, a gain of approximately $14.0 million associated with the early termination of certain natural gas hedge positions, a pre tax charge of $9.3 million for unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives, a pre tax charge of $12.8 million for upward adjustments to AROs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex and a $6.1 million tax benefit from a refund of Canadian income taxes. Net Sales Our net sales were $1.9 billion for both 2006 and 2005. Higher average selling prices for ammonia and phosphate fertilizers in 2006 were offset by lower nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes. Our total sales volume of 8.4 million tons for 2006 approximated the volume sold in 2005. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 119,000 tons, or 2%, to 6.3 million tons for 2006 compared to 6.4 million tons in 2005, due primarily to the cessation of production by U.S. Agri Chemicals to whom we had sold ammonia previously. Our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 2.1 million tons for 2006 approximated the amount sold in 2005. Nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices for 2006 averaged 2% and 6% higher, respectively, than the prices for similar products in 2005. Cost of Sales Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $217 per ton for 2006 compared to $202 per ton in 2005, an increase of 7%, primarily due to higher natural gas costs and higher purchased product costs. 37 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged $207 per ton for 2006 compared to $200 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 4%, mainly due to higher ammonia and sulfur costs. During 2006, we sold approximately 3.0 million tons of fertilizer under our FPP, representing approximately 36% of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2005, we sold approximately 5.2 million tons of fertilizer under this program, representing approximately 62% of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period. The lower level of FPP sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those periods. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% to $54.5 million in 2006 compared to $57.0 million in 2005. The year over year decrease in expense for 2006 resulted largely from the absence of expenses related to our August 2005 IPO, including expenses associated with the termination of a long term incentive plan upon completion of our IPO. This decrease was partially offset by additional stock based compensation expense and additional administrative expenses associated with being a publicly held company, both incurred in 2006. Other Operating Net Other operating net increased to $21.4 million in 2006 from $14.1 million in 2005. On an annual basis, we review all aspects of the closed Bartow complex with respect to asset retirement obligations (AROs) and other plant site closure related activities. As a result of our 2006 review, we have revised our estimates for water treatment and phosphogypsum stack system closure costs, as well as costs to close the Bartow plant site. Additional costs are expected to be incurred to treat water, mainly in 2007 and 2008, to accommodate closure of the cooling pond. Phosphogypsum stack system closure costs associated with the cooling channel are expected to increase due to additional closure work and higher costs for previously identified activities. We also expect to incur additional costs related to site closure activities, including closure of wastewater treatment systems as well as storm water management. Consequently, we recorded a charge of $14.9 million, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006, to reflect these revised estimates. We also recorded a $3.3 million charge, again primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006, for additional planned demolition activities at Bartow. In 2005, $11.1 million of adjustments to Bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement costs were recorded as a result of revised engineering estimates prepared in connection with the preparation of a revised closure plan for the Plant City phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond system. For a detailed explanation of the accounting for AROs at Bartow, please refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Interest Net Net interest income increased to $9.6 million in 2006 from $0.6 million in 2005. Interest expense decreased 79% to $2.9 million in 2006 from $14.0 million in 2005, due to the full repayment of our term notes, out of our cash and short term investments, in the third quarter of 2005. This decrease was partially offset by $1.0 million of interest expense in the second quarter of 2006 related to a Canadian tax matter. Interest income decreased to $12.5 million in 2006 from $14.6 million in 2005 as higher average rates of return were more than offset by lower average balances of invested cash. Minority Interest Amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFLs common and preferred shares. The increase in 2006 was due to improved 2006 CFL operating results. The improvement in CFL operating results reflects stronger market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers produced in Canada. 38 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Income Taxes Our income tax provision for 2006 was $19.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 37.2%. This compared with a tax provision of $128.7 million on pre tax earnings for 2005. For 2005, the income tax provision of $128.7 million included the following items: income tax expense of $35.4 million on earnings before income taxes; a charge of $99.9 million to establish a valuation allowance, as previously discussed; a tax benefit of $0.5 million for adjustments to prior years tax returns; and a tax benefit related to a Canadian income tax refund of $6.1 million. Our effective tax rate (exclusive of the $99.9 million non cash charge and the $6.1 million refund of Canadian income taxes) was 37.7%. The decrease in the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes results principally from lower state income taxes. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 In 2005, the domestic nitrogen fertilizer industry, which benefited from tight global supply conditions through most of the year, was adversely impacted by rising natural gas prices in the third and fourth quarters of the year. The domestic phosphate fertilizer industry continued to show improvement due primarily to strong export demand earlier in 2005 and a tighter domestic supply/demand balance in the second half of the year due to hurricane related production curtailments. Our total gross margin decreased by approximately $6.9 million, or 3%, to $209.2 million in 2005 from $216.1 million in 2004 due largely to deteriorating nitrogen fertilizer market conditions in the latter part of the year, partially offset by increased selling prices for phosphate fertilizers. The net loss of $39.0 million in 2005 included a $99.9 million charge to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforwards generated during our pre IPO operations as a cooperative, a $6.1 million refund of Canadian income taxes, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to our accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations that reduced net earnings by $2.8 million, a $28.3 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt, a gain of approximately $14.0 million on our derivatives due to the early termination of hedge positions recognized in the third quarter, an increase of $11.1 million in Bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement obligations related to revised engineering cost estimates, and $9.3 million of unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives. Net Sales Our net sales increased 16% to $1.9 billion in 2005 compared to $1.7 billion in 2004, due to higher average selling prices and an increase in phosphate fertilizer sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes. Nitrogen fertilizer prices in 2005 averaged 19% higher than the prices for similar products in the comparable period of 2004 reflecting strong demand and tight supply. Phosphate fertilizer prices in 2005 were 10% higher than corresponding prices in 2004, resulting primarily from strong international demand during the first half of the year and tight domestic supply during the second half of 2005. Our total annual sales volume was 8.4 million tons in 2005 compared to 8.5 million tons in 2004, as a 109,000 ton increase in the volume of phosphate fertilizers sold in 2005 was more than offset by a 174,000 ton decrease in nitrogen fertilizer sales volume. Cost of Sales Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $202 per ton in 2005 compared to $164 per ton in 2004, an increase of 23%, primarily due to higher natural gas prices as well as higher purchased product costs. Phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged $200 per ton in 2005 compared to $187 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 7%, mainly due to higher phosphate rock and ammonia costs. 39 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 36% to $57.0 million in 2005 compared to $41.8 million in 2004. The $15.2 million increase in 2005 was largely due to increased administrative expenses related to completion of our initial public offering ($6.5 million), our long term incentive plan ($3.3 million), including expenses associated with the termination of the plan upon completion of our initial public offering, and compensation expense associated with our stock based awards ($3.2 million). Other Operating Net Other operating net decreased to $14.1 million in 2005 from $25.1 million in 2004. The $11.0 million decrease was due primarily to a $4.6 million decrease in costs related to the Bartow facility in 2005 compared to 2004, $2.2 million of gains realized in 2005 on the sales of a previously idled distribution terminal and excess land at our Bartow complex, and a $3.4 million provision recorded in 2004 for environmental remediation requirements at our Ahoskie, North Carolina nitrogen facility, which has been closed for 23 years. An $11.8 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004 for future expenditures to treat water at Bartow and other Bartow environmental remediation requirements. Prior to that time, Bartow water treatment costs were expensed as incurred. A decrease in recurring Bartow water treatment expense in 2005 was partially offset by $11.1 million of adjustments to Bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement obligations as a result of revised engineering cost estimates. The decrease in recurring Bartow water treatment expense in 2005 was due to the accounting treatment prior to the fourth quarter of 2004. For a detailed explanation of the accounting for water treatment costs at Bartow, please refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Interest Net Interest net swung to $0.6 million of net interest income in 2005 from $16.8 million of net expense in 2004. Interest expense decreased 38% to $14.0 million in 2005 from $22.7 million in 2004, primarily due to lower average debt outstanding in 2005. The decrease in debt outstanding in 2005 was due to scheduled principal payments as well as the full repayment of our term notes. Interest income more than doubled to $14.6 million in 2005 from $5.9 million in 2004 as a result of higher average rates of return and, to a lesser extent, higher average balances of invested cash. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt The $28.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2005 consists of a $26.4 million penalty associated with the prepayment of our term notes and the write off of $1.9 million of unamortized financing fees related to our long term debt and our previous senior secured revolving credit facility. Minority Interest Amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFLs common and preferred shares. The decrease in 2005 was due to reduced CFL operating results. The deterioration in CFL operating results reflects weaker market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers, particularly in the latter half of 2005. Income Taxes Our income tax provision in 2005 included a non cash charge of $99.9 million recorded in the third quarter, as previously discussed, a $6.1 million refund of Canadian income taxes received in the third quarter as well as the normal provision for income taxes on earnings. Our effective tax rate (exclusive of 40 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. the $99.9 million non cash charge and the $6.1 million refund of Canadian income taxes) was approximately 38% in both 2005 and 2004. An increase in our 2005 effective tax rate due to the tax effect of expenses associated with our initial public offering, which are not deductible for income tax purposes, was offset by a tax benefit for adjustments for prior years tax returns. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle Net of Taxes In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded additional asset retirement obligations due to implementation of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations and recorded a related charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle reduced net earnings in 2005 by $2.8 million. For a discussion of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, please see the Overview section of this discussion and analysis. 41 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Segment Review Our business is organized and managed internally based on two segments, the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business, which are differentiated primarily by their products, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate. Nitrogen Fertilizer Business The following table presents summary operating data for our nitrogen fertilizer business: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2006 v. 2005 2005 v. 2004 (in millions, except as noted) Net sales $ 1,467.2 $ 1,469.7 $ 1,273.9 $ (2.5 ) $ 195.8 Cost of sales 1,368.7 1,296.8 1,080.1 71.9 216.7 Gross margin $ 98.5 $ 172.9 $ 193.8 $ (74.4 ) $ (20.9 ) Gross margin percentage 6.7 % 11.8 % 15.2 % Tons of product sold (000s) 6,310 6,429 6,603 (119 ) (174 ) Sales volume by product (000s) Ammonia 1,226 1,382 1,438 (156 ) (56 ) Urea 2,619 2,518 2,513 101 5 UAN 2,420 2,483 2,593 (63 ) (110 ) Other nitrogen products 45 46 59 (1 ) (13 ) Average selling price per ton by product Ammonia $ 361 $ 316 $ 278 $ 45 $ 38 Urea 244 249 205 (5 ) 44 UAN 158 162 137 (4 ) 25 Cost of natural gas (per MMBtu) (1) Donaldsonville $ 7.20 $ 7.12 $ 5.60 $ 0.08 $ 1.52 Medicine Hat 6.56 6.83 5.10 (0.27 ) 1.73 Average daily market price of natural gas (per MMBtu) Henry Hub (Louisiana) $ 6.74 $ 8.86 $ 5.85 $ (2.12 ) $ 3.01 AECO (Alberta) 5.76 7.26 5.04 (1.50 ) 2.22 Depreciation and amortization $ 59.2 $ 63.0 $ 71.4 $ (3.8 ) $ (8.4 ) Capital expenditures $ 25.9 $ 44.4 $ 13.8 $ (18.5 ) $ 30.6 Production volume by product (000s) Ammonia (2) (3) 3,158 2,778 3,356 380 (578 ) Granular urea (2) 2,334 2,065 2,322 269 (257 ) UAN (28%) 2,336 2,256 2,640 80 (384 ) (1) Includes the cost of natural gas purchases and realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives.

(3) Gross ammonia production, including amounts subsequently upgraded on site into urea and or UAN. 42 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Sales. Nitrogen fertilizer net sales were $1.5 billion for both 2006 and 2005, as higher average ammonia selling prices were, for the most part, offset by lower sales volume. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 2% to 6.3 million tons in 2006 compared to 6.4 million tons in 2005. Ammonia and UAN sales volumes decreased by 11% and 3%, respectively, for 2006 compared to the prior year while urea sales volume increased by 4%. Ammonia sales volumes decreased due primarily to lower sales from our Tampa terminal due to U.S. Agri Chemicals, a former customer, ceasing phosphate operations in 2005. Increases in industry consumption in the fall in anticipation of strong corn and wheat prices offset a spring during which the industry experienced fewer corn acres planted and reduced application rates. The decrease in UAN sales compared to sales for 2005 was due primarily to less corn acreage planted and reduced demand in the southern portion of the country due to drought conditions, both experienced during the first half of 2006. The impact of these factors was partially offset by strong summer and fall fill demand resulting from the anticipation of a stronger UAN market later in 2006 and into the spring of 2007. Ammonia sales prices increased by 14% for 2006 compared to the prior year, primarily due to tight world market conditions and strong fourth quarter domestic demand. Cost of Sales. Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $217 per ton for 2006, compared to $202 per ton for 2005, an increase of 7%, largely due to unfavorable variances related to natural gas derivatives and higher purchased product costs. While the overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our Donaldsonville facility and CFLs Medicine Hat facility decreased by 1% for 2006 versus the cost in 2005, the favorable effect of this variance was more than offset by the impact of the realized losses on natural gas derivatives immediately recognized in cost of sales. We recognized $30.7 million of unrealized mark to market losses on derivatives in 2006 compared to $9.3 million in 2005 due to our discontinuing hedge accounting in the last quarter of 2005, and the decline in natural gas prices that occurred during the respective periods. We also recorded approximately $14.0 million of hedge gains in 2005, mainly in the third quarter. The costs of finished fertilizer products purchased for resale were approximately $8.9 million higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices as well as an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products, both factors mainly occurring during the first six months of 2006. See the Overview section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about the impact of accounting for our natural gas derivatives. During 2006, we sold approximately 2.7 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our FPP, representing approximately 44% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2005, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period. The lower level of FPP sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those respective periods. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Sales. Nitrogen fertilizer net sales increased 15% to $1.5 billion in 2005 compared to $1.3 billion in 2004, as higher average selling prices more than offset a decrease in sales volume. Ammonia, urea and UAN sales prices increased by 14%, 21% and 18%, respectively, in 2005 compared to the prior year. The increase in ammonia prices in the first half of 2005 was due to strong U.S. demand and tight supply conditions in midwestern U.S. markets. During the last half of 2005, the sharp increase in natural gas prices and the resulting drop in domestic production caused ammonia prices to increase. Urea prices increased in 2005 due to a tight world market caused by plant outages abroad, reduced domestic production resulting from higher natural gas prices and the impact of increased buying related to demand that had been deferred from previous periods. An improved overall nitrogen fertilizer market earlier in 43 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. 2005, combined with tight supplies resulting from reduced domestic production later in the year because of higher natural gas prices, supported higher UAN selling prices in 2005. Our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 3% in 2005 to 6.4 million tons as compared to 6.6 million tons sold in 2004. Although both ammonia and UAN sales volumes decreased by 4% from 2004, urea sales volume was comparable to the prior year. The decrease in ammonia sales volume was primarily due to the loss of sales out of our Tampa, Florida terminal due to the loss of a key customer. UAN sales volume declined in 2005 due to reduced supply availability resulting from scheduled plant turnarounds and production and shipping disruptions caused by two hurricanes. Cost of Sales. Total cost of sales of nitrogen fertilizers averaged $202 per ton in 2005 compared to $164 per ton in 2004, an increase of 23%, largely due to higher natural gas prices, higher purchased product costs and unrealized mark to market losses, partially offset by the favorable impact of the early termination of certain natural gas hedge positions associated with our forward pricing program. The overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our Donaldsonville and CFLs Medicine Hat facilities increased by 29% in 2005 versus the cost in 2004, mainly due to continued tight market conditions for natural gas and the impact of the two gulf hurricanes. Purchased product costs were approximately $57.3 million higher in 2005 than in 2004, due to additional quantities purchased to meet sales commitments as well as the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices previously discussed. As previously mentioned, we recognized as a reduction of cost of sales in the third quarter of 2005, a gain of approximately $14.0 million which arose from the early termination of FPP related natural gas positions. We also recognized $9.3 million of unrealized mark to market losses on derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2005 as an increase in cost of sales due to our discontinuation of hedge accounting. See the Overview section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about the impact of accounting for our natural gas derivatives. During 2005, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer under our forward pricing program, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume. In 2004, we sold approximately 3.6 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 54% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the year. 44 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Phosphate Fertilizer Business The following table presents summary operating data for our phosphate fertilizer business: Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2006 v. 2005 2005 v. 2004 (in millions, except as noted) Net sales $ 482.3 $ 438.7 $ 376.8 $ 43.6 $ 61.9 Cost of sales 433.6 402.4 354.5 31.2 47.9 Gross margin $ 48.7 $ 36.3 $ 22.3 $ 12.4 $ 14.0 Gross margin percentage 10.1 % 8.3 % 5.9 % Tons of product sold (000s) 2,090 2,009 1,900 81 109 Sales volume by product (000s) DAP 1,676 1,583 1,549 93 34 MAP 414 426 351 (12 ) 75 Domestic vs export sales of DAP/MAP (000s) Domestic 1,447 1,392 1,218 55 174 Export 643 617 682 26 (65 ) Average selling price per ton by product DAP $ 230 $ 217 $ 197 $ 13 $ 20 MAP 234 223 204 11 19 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 33.1 $ 32.0 $ 35.1 $ 1.1 $ (3.1 ) Capital expenditures $ 32.2 $ 25.6 $ 16.2 $ 6.6 $ 9.4 Production volume by product (000s) Phosphate rock 3,805 3,647 3,280 158 367 Sulfuric acid 2,598 2,507 2,455 91 52 Phosphoric acid as P2O5(1) 1,009 978 967 31 11 DAP/MAP 2,023 1,945 1,933 78 12 (1) P2O5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Sales. Phosphate fertilizer net sales increased 10% to $482.3 million for 2006 compared to $438.7 million in 2005, due to higher average selling prices and increased sales volumes. Average phosphate fertilizer prices during 2006 increased by 6% compared to prices in 2005 due to the impact of increased domestic demand on what was already a relatively tight supply/demand balance. Our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales volumes of 2.1 million tons in 2006 increased by 4% over the prior years level due primarily to stronger domestic demand for DAP during the second half of the year. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we made our first DAP export sales through Phoschem, an export association representing North American phosphate producers. We joined Phoschem in October of 2006. Phoschem is presently our primary means of exporting phosphate fertilizer products. Approximately 22% of our 2006 fourth quarter phosphate fertilizer net sales were made through Phoschem. Cost of Sales. Phosphate cost of sales averaged $207 per ton for 2006 compared to $200 per ton for 2005. The 4% increase was mainly due to higher ammonia and sulfur costs. Ammonia prices increased by 6% during 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting stronger global market conditions through the first half of 2006. Sulfur costs increased by 3% for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase, mainly occurring in the first 45 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. six months of 2006, reflected the lingering impact of supply disruptions that occurred in 2005 due to hurricane activity. During 2006, we sold approximately 294,000 tons of phosphate fertilizers under our FPP, representing approximately 14% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2005, we sold approximately 718,000 tons of phosphate fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 36% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period. The lower level of FPP sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those respective periods. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net Sales. Phosphate fertilizer net sales increased 16% to $438.7 million in 2005 compared to $376.8 million in 2004, due to a combination of higher average selling prices and increased sales volume. Our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 2.0 million tons in 2005 represented an increase of 6% compared to 2004. Within our total phosphate fertilizer sales, sales of DAP/MAP to domestic customers increased by 14%, totaling 1.4 million tons in 2005, compared to 1.2 million tons in 2004. The increase in sales to domestic customers in 2005 as compared to 2004 is due to increased market penetration. Average phosphate fertilizer prices in 2005 increased by 10% compared to prices in 2004, due largely to strong international phosphate fertilizer demand in the first half of the year, as well as the impact of domestic industry production cuts occurring mainly over the second half of 2005. Cost of Sales. Phosphate cost of sales averaged $200 per ton in 2005 compared to $187 per ton in 2004. The 7% increase was mainly due to higher phosphate rock costs and higher ammonia costs. Phosphate rock costs increased by 17% in 2005 compared to 2004 due primarily to increased costs resulting from less favorable mining conditions over the first six months of 2005. Ammonia prices increased by 10% in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting stronger global market conditions mainly in the last three quarters of 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of cash are operating cash flow, which includes customer advances, and our senior secured revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are operating costs, working capital needs, capital expenditures and dividends. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices for our products, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonality factors inherent in the business. Cash Balances As of December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $25.4 million, short term investments of $300.2 million and a $102.7 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our forward pricing program. As of December 31, 2005, the comparable amounts were $37.4 million, $179.3 million and $131.6 million, respectively. Our short term investments consist of available for sale auction rate securities that are reported at fair value. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, our operating cash flows, and credit available under our senior secured revolving credit facility are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had $176.4 million and $192.6 million available, respectively, under our senior secured revolving credit facility. 46 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Debt Notes payable, representing amounts owed by CFL to its minority interest holder with respect to advances, were $4.2 million as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. There were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under out $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2005. On August 16, 2005, we replaced our $140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a new $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate and is available through August 16, 2010. This facility is secured by working capital, certain equipment and the Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex. The credit facility provides up to $250 million, subject to a borrowing base, for working capital and general corporate purposes, including up to $50 million for the issuance of letters of credit. There was $176.4 million of available credit under the senior secured revolving credit facility and no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit as of December 31, 2006. On August 17, 2005, we repaid in full $235.6 million of our outstanding term notes, plus associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of $29.3 million, with cash on hand and by liquidating short term investments. Capital Spending Capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base, to increase our capacity and to improve plant efficiency. In response to the difficult industry environment prior to 2004, we had deferred non essential capital expenditures whenever it was possible to do so without compromising the operational integrity of our facilities or the safety of our employees. The $10.1 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2006 as compared to 2005 related primarily to greater plant turnaround activity during 2005. We expect to spend approximately $110 million to $120 million on capital expenditures in both 2007 and 2008. The projection for 2007 includes spending carried over from projects initiated in 2006. These amounts also include approximately $24 million in 2007 and $14 million in 2008 for capital expenditures at CFL, of which we are obligated to fund 66%. Financial Assurance Requirements In addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate fertilizer business, we are subject to financial assurance requirements. Previously, these financial assurance requirements were satisfied without the need for any advance expenditure of corporate funds provided our financial statements met certain criteria, referred to as the financial tests. However, pursuant to a 2005 amendment to the Florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure of phosphogypsum stacks, we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations in order to take advantage of a safe harbor provision in the regulations that would obviate the need for us to meet the financial test criteria in the future. In March of 2006, we contributed $11.1 million to this escrow account, which by rule is earmarked to cover the closure, long term maintenance, and monitoring costs for our phosphosgypsum stacks, as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure. In the first quarter of 2007, we expect to contribute another $9.4 million. Over the next nine years, we expect to contribute between $4.0 million and $7.0 million annually based upon the required funding formula as defined in the regulations and an assumed rate of return of 4% on invested funds. The amount of money that will accumulate in the account by the year 2016, including interest earned on invested funds, is currently estimated to be approximately $85 million. After 2016, contributions to the account are estimated to average less than $1.0 million annually for the following 17 years. The balance in the account is estimated to be approximately $170 million by 2033. The amounts recognized as expense in 47 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. These expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the account, which are based on the guidelines set forth in the Florida regulations. Ultimately, the cash in this account will be used to settle the asset retirement obligations. Additionally, Florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities. We will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities, if and when we are able to expand our Hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted. The demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in Florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a cash deposit arrangement. Based on these current regulations, we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in Florida utilizing either of these methods. Forward Pricing Program (FPP) We offer a FPP to our customers under which product may be ordered for future delivery, with a significant portion of the sales proceeds generally being collected before the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had approximately $102.7 million and $131.6 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had approximately 1.7 million tons of product and 1.2 million tons of product, respectively, committed to be sold under the FPP. Most of this product was scheduled to ship within 150 days of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. While customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2006 and 2005, the level of sales under the FPP is affected by many factors, including current market conditions and our customers perceptions of future market fundamentals. The lower level as of December 31, 2005 reflected the hesitancy of our customers to make commitments in the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during that reporting period. The level of our customers participation in our FPP may vary over time. Should the level of participation decrease, there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods. If the level of sales under the FPP were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease, and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Also, borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary. Due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future FPP sales activity. Other Liquidity Requirements We paid cash dividends of $4.4 million on outstanding common stock during 2006. This amount represents an annual rate equal to $0.08 per share. We expect to pay quarterly dividends at such a rate for the foreseeable future. Under certain conditions, our $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends. We also funded contributions to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans totaling $8.6 million in 2006. We expect to contribute $5.6 million to our pension plans in 2007. 48 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Cash Flows Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2006 was $203.6 million compared to $137.2 million in 2005. The $66.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was primarily due to $95.6 million less cash used to fund working capital in 2006. Other major factors affecting operating cash flow during 2006 were a $66.8 million decrease in operating earnings, partially offset by the adjustment for the $21.4 million non cash effect of unrealized losses on derivatives. The $95.6 million reduction in cash used to fund working capital is the difference between $9.5 million used in 2006 and $105.1 million consumed in 2005. During 2006, accounts receivable increased by $61.3 million and customer advances decreased by $28.9 million, resulting in a net use of cash of $90.2 million, which was partially offset by a $51.6 million decrease in inventories and a $17.1 million decrease in margin deposits. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to more volume shipped under normal commercial terms. A significant portion of the sales proceeds for volumes shipped under the FPP is generally received prior to shipment. The decrease in customer advances was due primarily to changes in the product mix of outstanding orders and lower per unit contract prices. The decrease in inventories reflects lower per unit nitrogen fertilizers manufacturing cost and lower quantities of phosphate fertilizers held at December 31, 2006. The decrease in margin deposits was primarily due to lower margin requirements. The use of $105.1 million in cash in 2005 for working capital changes was primarily due to a $79.9 million decrease in customer advances and a $14.8 million change in net product exchanges assets. The decrease in customer advances was primarily due to lower levels of forward sales on order as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004. On the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, a portion of the spare parts inventory has been reclassified from inventory to other noncurrent assets, based on our expectations of when these parts will be utilized. On the consolidated statements of cash flows, corresponding reclassifications have been made to inventory and other net in operating activities. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2005 was $137.2 million compared to $344.2 million in 2004. The $207.0 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was primarily due to a $206.4 million increase in cash used to fund working capital. Net changes in working capital consumed $105.1 million of cash in 2005 compared to $101.3 million of cash generated by working capital reductions in 2004. During 2005, accounts receivable increased by $9.2 million, inventories increased by $10.3 million, net product exchange assets increased by $14.8 million and customer advances decreased by $79.9 million, resulting in a net use of cash of $114.2 million, which was partially offset by a $10.2 million decrease in margin deposits. The increase in accounts receivable was due to higher selling prices in December of 2005 versus December of 2004 and reduced sales volume shipped under the forward pricing program for which a substantial portion of the sales proceeds is generally received prior to shipment. The increase in inventories was due to higher per unit manufacturing costs and increased prices for purchased products, which were partially offset by reduced quantities held at December 31, 2005. The decrease in customer advances was primarily due to lower levels of forward sales on order as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004. The $101.3 million of cash generated by changes in working capital in 2004 was primarily due to a $45.5 million increase in customer advances, a $41.4 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $44.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The increase in customer advances in 2004 was due primarily to higher levels of forward sales on order as of December 31, 2004 as compared to December 31, 2003. The decrease in accounts receivable was due primarily to an 49 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. increase in sales volume shipped under the forward pricing program for which a substantial portion of the sales proceeds is generally received prior to shipment. The increased accounts payable and accrued expenses were largely related to higher trade credit obligations to our gas suppliers, reflecting higher natural gas prices. On the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, amounts owed and due from product exchanges have been reclassified from a net amount in inventory to current assets and current liabilities to conform to the 2005 presentation. On the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2005 and 2004, corresponding adjustments have been made to inventory and product exchanges net. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income (loss) or cash flow from operations. Investing Activities Years Ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 Net cash used in investing activities was $191.3 million in 2006, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $139.3 million in 2005 and net cash used in investing activities of $309.3 million in 2004. The $330.6 million swing in cash used in investing activities in 2006, as well as the change from 2004 to 2005, were primarily due to the liquidation of short term investments for the $235.6 million prepayment of our term notes in 2005, as previously discussed. The level of short term investments, generally auction rate securities that we liquidate as required over periods ranging from three to twelve months, is dictated by our current cash position and estimated future liquidity requirements. Additions to property, plant and equipment net accounted for $59.3 million, $69.4 million, and $33.7 million of cash used in investing activities in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment net in 2006 was due primarily to a $15.5 million decrease in deferred plant turnaround costs incurred during 2006 as compared to 2005. In 2005, additions to property, plant and equipment net were greater than 2004 due primarily to a $23.6 million increase in deferred plant turnaround costs incurred. We contributed $11.1 million in March of 2006 to our asset retirement obligation escrow account. The $18.6 million of proceeds from sale of unconsolidated subsidiary represents the cash realized from the July 15, 2005 sale of our interest in our CF Martin Sulphur joint venture to our joint venture partner, an affiliate of Martin Resource Management. Financing Activities Years Ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 Net cash used in financing activities was $23.3 million, $290.7 million and $61.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $267.4 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2006 versus 2005, as well as the change from 2004 to 2005, was primarily due to the 2005 repayment of $235.6 million of our term debt and the associated prepayment penalty of $26.4 million as previously discussed. Distributions to minority interest were higher in 2006, as all of CFLs 2005 net earnings were distributed in 2006, whereas the majority of CFLs 2004 net earnings were distributed in 2004. The $715.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the corresponding exchange of stock represent the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in the third quarter of 2005 and the subsequent payments to our pre IPO owners. See the Overview section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about our IPO. 50 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Obligations Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006: Payments Due by Period 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Total (in millions) Contractual Obligations Debt Long term debt (1) $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Notes payable (2) 4.2 4.2 Interest payments on long term debt and notes payable (1) 0.4 0.4 0.4 1.2 Other Obligations Operating leases 20.0 11.9 9.6 4.6 3.2 9.1 58.4 Equipment purchases and plant improvements 20.1 20.1 Transportation (3) 24.1 14.7 15.1 15.6 16.0 243.2 328.7 Purchase obligations (4)(5)(6) 334.1 38.8 29.3 28.3 0.3 430.8 Total $ 398.7 $ 65.8 $ 58.6 $ 48.5 $ 19.5 $ 252.3 $ 843.4 (1) Based on debt balances and interest rates as of December 31, 2006. All our long term debt was repaid on August 17, 2005. See the Overview section of this discussion and analysis for further information on the transaction. (2) Represents notes payable to the CFL minority interest holder. While the entire principal amount is due December 31, 2009, CFL may prepay all or a portion of the principal at its sole option. (3) Includes anticipated expenditures under certain requirements contracts to transport raw materials and finished product between our facilities. The majority of these arrangements allow for reductions in usage based on our actual operating rates. Amounts set forth above are based on normal operating rates and contracted or spot prices, where applicable, as of December 31, 2006 and actual operating rates and prices may differ. (4) Includes minimum commitments to purchase natural gas based on prevailing NYMEX forward prices at December 31, 2006. Also includes minimum commitments to purchase ammonia and urea for resale and commitments to purchase ammonia and sulfur for use in phosphate fertilizer production. The amounts set forth above for these commitments are based on spot prices as of December 31, 2006 and actual prices may differ. (5) Liquid markets exist for the possible resale of the natural gas, ammonia and urea purchased for resale and ammonia and sulfur purchased for use in phosphate fertilizer production under the majority of these commitments, but gains or losses could be incurred on resale. (6) Purchase obligations do not include any amounts related to our financial hedges associated with natural gas purchases. 51 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Other Long Term Obligations As of December 31, 2006, our other liabilities included balances related to asset retirement obligations (AROs) and environmental remediation liabilities and shutdown costs. The estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows: Payments Due by Period 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 Total (in millions) Other Long Term Obligations Asset retirement obligations (1) (2) $ 15.9 $ 9.2 $ 5.5 $ 5.7 $ 3.7 $ 526.2 $ 566.2 Environmental remediation liabilities and shutdown costs 3.1 0.8 0.4 0.4 0.4 4.5 9.6 Total $ 19.0 $ 10.0 $ 5.9 $ 6.1 $ 4.1 $ 530.7 $ 575.8 (1) Represents the undiscounted, inflation adjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the AROs. The corresponding present value of these future expenditures is $87.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and $74.5 million as of December 31, 2005. The increase in the present value of these future expenditures is due to recording changes in estimates on existing AROs as previously discussed. We also have unrecorded AROs at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex, at CFLs Medicine Hat facility and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included is reclamation of land and, in the case of Donaldsonville, reclamation of two effluent ponds. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in 2006 dollars is between $12 million and $15 million. We do not currently believe that there is a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities. Therefore, the table above does not contain any cash flows for these AROs. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of our AROs. As described in Financial Assurance Requirements, we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in an escrow account established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack system. This account will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the AROs pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack system. (2) Cash flows occurring after 2011 are detailed in the following table. 52 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. The following table details the undiscounted, inflation adjusted estimated cash flows after 2011 required to settle the recorded AROs, as discussed above. Payments Due by Period 201223 202430 203134 203542 204347 After 2047 Total (in millions) Asset retirement obligations after 2011 cash flows $ 45.5 $ 21.1 $ 91.6 $ 84.3 $ 29.4 $ 254.3 $ 526.2 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when title is transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, or creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change as market conditions change. Useful Lives of Depreciable Assets In the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed a comprehensive review of the depreciable lives of our production facilities and related assets, as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our units of production (UOP) depreciation expense. As a result of this review, we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities from ten years to fifteen years. Separately, we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain UOP assets at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex and all UOP assets at our Plant City, Florida phosphate complex. As a result of these changes, we expect that depreciation expense will be reduced by approximately $11 million during 2007. Of the $11 million anticipated reduction in depreciation expense, approximately $10 million relates to our nitrogen production assets and $1 million relates to our phosphate production assets. Included in the $10 million expected decrease in depreciation for nitrogen assets is approximately $1 million relating to CFL, a joint venture of which we own 66%. 53 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. We review the depreciable lives assigned to our production facilities and related assets on a periodic basis, and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews. Inventory Valuation We review our inventory balances at least quarterly, and more frequently if required by market conditions, to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value. This review process incorporates current industry and customer specific trends, current operational plans for the inventory and historical price activity of inventory. If the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value, we would immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly. Upon inventory liquidation, if the actual sales price ultimately realized were less than our initial estimate of net realizable value, additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Remediation Liabilities Costs associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the Bartow and Plant City, Florida phosphate fertilizer complexes and costs associated with land reclamation activities at our Hardee, Florida phosphate rock mine are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. If the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated, asset retirement obligations (AROs) are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service. Costs associated with the cessation of operations at all of our facilities are accounted for in accordance with FIN No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. This interpretation requires us to recognize a liability for AROs for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. The obligations related to closure, reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded. The liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense. Accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time. The asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life. The aggregate carrying value of all of our AROs was $87.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and $74.5 million as of December 31, 2005. The increase in the aggregate carrying value of these AROs is due to recording changes in estimates on existing AROs as previously discussed. Environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies. Estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, site specific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations. In reporting environmental liabilities, no offset is made for potential recoveries. All liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur. In accordance with GAAP, environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits. Changes in laws, regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements. The amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled $9.4 million as of December 31, 2006 and $7.9 million as of December 31, 2005. The actual amounts to be spent on AROs and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments and cost inflation, as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations. The estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. 54 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Recoverability of Long Lived Assets We review the carrying values of our plant, property and equipment on a regular basis in accordance with SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. If impairment of an asset has occurred, an impairment charge is recognized immediately. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, prices, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The recoverability of the values associated with our long lived assets is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the ability of the Company to generate sufficient taxable income, of an appropriate character, in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Upon the completion of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes. On the date of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. had a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) generated from business conducted with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners. These net operating loss carryforwards totaled $250 million, with expirations ranging from 2021 through 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a charge of $99.9 million to establish a 100% valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these NOLs. The valuation allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized since CF Industries, Inc. is no longer a cooperative for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a net operating loss agreement with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners (NOL Agreement) relating to the future treatment of the pre IPO NOLs. Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the IPO, we will pay to CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved. Pension Assets and Liabilities Pension assets and liabilities are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Our projected benefit obligation (PBO) related to our qualified pension plans was $238.5 million at December 31, 2006, which was $29.7 million higher than pension plan assets. The December 31, 2006 PBO was computed based on a 5.70% discount rate, which was based on yields for high quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. If the discount rate used to compute the PBO was lower by 50 basis points, our PBO would have been $17.4 million higher than the amount previously discussed. Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute the PBO was higher by 50 basis points, our PBO would have been $15.6 million lower. The discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2006 was 5.50% and was the discount rate used to 55 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. compute the PBO at December 31, 2005. If the discount rate used to compute 2006 pension expense was lower by 50 basis points, 2006 pension expense would have been approximately $1.8 million higher than the amount calculated. Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute 2006 pension expense was higher by 50 basis points, 2006 pension expense would have been approximately $1.7 million lower than the amount calculated. Our net benefit obligation, after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate. The 7.5% expected long term rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non equity investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding periods. If the expected long term rate of return on assets was higher by 50 basis points, pension expense for 2006 would have been $0.9 million lower. Conversely, if the expected long term rate of return on assets was lower by 50 basis points, pension expense for 2006 would have been $0.9 million higher. Retiree Medical Benefits Retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions, including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense. Stock Based Compensation Costs associated with stock based compensation are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all share based awards over the service period. The fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. Key assumptions used in the Black Scholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected life. The basis for determining these assumptions may change as more experience is obtained with our own historical stock prices and employees option exercise behavior. We accrue the cost of stock based awards on the straight line method over the applicable vesting period. As a result, total compensation cost recognized for 2006 on a pre tax basis was $8.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, on a pre tax basis there was approximately $11.6 million and $1.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over 1.4 and 1.6 years, respectively. See Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of stock based compensation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) as of December 31, 2006. This Statement requires an entity to recognize the funded status of benefit plans as assets and or liabilities on the balance sheet, recognize gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations in other comprehensive income, measure the defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end balance sheet and provide disclosure in the notes of the effects of the amortization of amounts included in other comprehensive income on the next fiscal years periodic benefit cost. The measurement provisions of the Statement had no impact on our consolidated financial statements, as our plan assets and benefit obligations were already measured as of year end. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 was an increase in liabilities for defined benefit plans of $47.9 million, a decrease in other noncurrent assets of $0.3 million, a net increase in deferred income tax assets of $18.1 million and an increase in accumulated other 56 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. comprehensive loss of $30.1 million. See Notes 3 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158. In 2006, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes was issued. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Interpretation is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007. We are performing a review and analysis to determine the impact of the adoption of the Interpretation on our consolidated financial statements. Forward Pricing Program (FPP) In mid 2003, we instituted a program that has reduced the risk inherent in the relationship between volatile fertilizer prices and natural gas costs for product that we manufacture. Our basic concept (principally applied to nitrogen fertilizers) is to fix the price of our principal raw material, natural gas, coincident with the establishment of the fertilizer sales price, which often occurs months in advance of shipment. Customer advances, which typically represent a significant portion of the contracts sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the FPP are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped, which can take up to several months. As is the case for all of our sales transactions, revenue is recognized when title transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers. We lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative instruments, or in some cases, with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases. During 2006, we sold approximately 2.7 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer, representing approximately 44% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume, and approximately 294,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, representing approximately 14% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume, under the FPP. In 2005, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume, and approximately 718,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, representing approximately 36% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume, under the FPP. During 2004, we sold approximately 3.9 million tons of fertilizer, representing approximately 45% of our sales volume, under the FPP. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had approximately 1.7 million tons of product and 1.2 million tons of product, respectively, committed to be sold under this program. The majority of these amounts were scheduled to ship within 150 days of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products and a substantial portion of the cost to manufacture the products under our FPP, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Participation in the FPP is affected by market conditions and our customers expectations. There can be no assurance that we will transact the same percentage of our business under the FPP in the future. Should the level of participation decrease, there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods. 57 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Discussion of Seasonality Impacts on Operations Our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and or our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Interest Rate Fluctuations Borrowings under variable rate notes payable bear a current market rate of interest such that we are subject to interest rate risk on these borrowings. The revolving credit facility bears a similar risk, but as of December 31, 2006, there were no borrowings under this facility. As of December 31, 2006, a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our floating rate loans, which totaled $4.2 million, would result in a $42,000 change in pretax earnings (loss) on an annual basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar as a result of our 66% economic interest and our 49% common equity interest in CFL. At the present time, we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to CFL. Commodity Prices Our net sales, cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to the nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer sales not made under the forward pricing program are sensitive to changes in nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials. A $1.00 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia by approximately $33. We use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen fertilizer products. Because natural gas prices are volatile, our Natural Gas Acquisition Policy includes the objective of providing protection against significant adverse natural gas price movements. We manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years. The derivative instruments currently used are swaps. These contracts reference primarily NYMEX futures contract prices, which represent fair value at any given time. The related contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. As of December 31, 2006, we had hedged approximately 30.6 million MMBtus of natural gas, most of which related to sales that had been contracted to be sold through our forward pricing program as of December 31, 2006. We also establish derivative positions in natural gas that are unrelated to forward pricing program contracts if we consider it appropriate to do so. 58 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Through the third quarter of 2005, we designated, documented and assessed accounting for hedge relationships, which resulted primarily in cash flow hedges that required us to record the derivatives as assets and liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss of an effective cash flow hedge was deferred in other comprehensive income (loss) until the month after the hedged natural gas was used to manufacture inventoried products, which approximated the period of inventory turns of upgraded products and the release of the cost of the hedged gas to cost of sales. Ineffective hedge gains and losses were recorded immediately in cost of sales. Instability in the natural gas market during the last half of 2005 and our resulting decision to supply FPP orders from sources other than production reduced our ability to predict future natural gas requirements. Consequently, we ceased classifying derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result, while the derivatives are still carried at their fair value on the balance sheet, unrealized gains or losses related to the derivatives are recognized in operations as they occur. We purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of DAP and MAP. We attempt to include any price fluctuations related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products, but there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered. We enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices. A $10 per related ton change in the cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change DAP production cost by $2.10 per ton and $3.80 per ton, respectively. We also purchase ammonia, urea and UAN to augment or replace production at our facilities. 59 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
