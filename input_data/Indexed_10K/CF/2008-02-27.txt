The following is an outline of the discussion and analysis included herein: Overview of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Our Company Financial Executive Summary Company History Key Industry Factors Factors Affecting Our Results Results of Consolidated Operations Operating Results by Business Segment Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Recent Accounting Pronouncements Forward Pricing Program (FPP) Discussion of Seasonality Impacts on Operations Overview of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Our Company We are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in North America. Our operations are organized into two business segments: the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business. Our principal products in the nitrogen fertilizer business are ammonia, urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution, or UAN. Our principal products in the phosphate fertilizer business are diammonium phosphate, or DAP, and monoammonium phosphate, or MAP. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2006, the most recent period for which such information is available, we supplied approximately 21% of the nitrogen and approximately 14% of the phosphate used in agricultural fertilizer applications in the United States, according to the Association of American Plant Food Officials. Our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern U.S. grain producing states. Our principal assets include: the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America (Donaldsonville, Louisiana); a 66% economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada (which we operate in Medicine Hat, Alberta, through Canadian Fertilizers Limited, or CFL, a consolidated variable interest entity); one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the United States (Plant City, Florida); 32 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. the most recently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation plant in the United States (Hardee County, Florida); an extensive system of terminals, warehouses and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States; and a 50% interest in KEYTRADE AG (Keytrade), a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland, which we account for as an equity method investment. Financial Executive Summary We reported net earnings of $372.7 million in 2007 compared to net earnings of $33.3 million in 2006, reflecting the impact of a strong market for our products due to a favorable agricultural environment which resulted in increases in both average selling prices and volume shipped. Our results for 2007 included a net $17.0 million pre tax unrealized mark to market gain ($11.0 million after tax) on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $1.0 million ($0.7 million after tax) for adjustments to our asset retirement obligations (AROs) and demolition costs. Net earnings of $33.3 million in 2006 included a net $30.7 million pre tax unrealized mark to market loss ($18.7 million after tax) on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $21.6 million ($13.1 million after tax) for adjustments to our asset retirement obligations (AROs) and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex. Our gross margin increased by $522.8 million to $670.0 million in 2007 compared to $147.2 million in 2006. The increase in gross margin resulted mainly from higher average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices and favorable unrealized mark to market adjustments on natural gas derivatives, partially offset by higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs. Our net sales increased 36% to $2.8 billion in 2007 compared to $2.0 billion in 2006. The increase reflected higher average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices and higher nitrogen fertilizer sales volume. Total sales volume was 8.9 million tons in 2007 as compared to 8.4 million tons in 2006. In 2007, we purchased a 50% voting interest in KEYTRADE AG (Keytrade), a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland for $25.9 million. We also purchased certain non voting preferred shares of Keytrade for $0.9 million and contributed an additional $12.8 million in subordinated financing. We recorded $0.9 million as our after tax share of Keytrades earnings since the date of our investment. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this discussion and analysis for additional information related to Keytrade. Cash flow from operations increased by $486.5 million to $690.1 million in 2007, due primarily to the improved operating results and strong sales and cash collections under our forward pricing program. As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents of $366.5 million, short term investments of $494.5 million and a $305.8 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our forward pricing program. As of December 31, 2006, the comparable amounts were $25.4 million, $300.2 million and $102.7 million, respectively. The increase was due primarily to cash generated from operations. We paid cash dividends of $4.5 million in 2007. 33 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Company History We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power. During the 1960s, we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1 billion in each of these decades. Through the end of 2002, we operated as a traditional supply cooperative. Our focus was on providing our pre IPO owners with an assured supply of fertilizer. Typically, over 80% of our annual sales volume was to our pre IPO owners. Though important, financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective. In 2002, we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance, rather than assured supply to our pre IPO owners, as our principal objective. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace. Under the new business model, we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance. One result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix. By 2007, our sales to customers other than our pre IPO owners and Western Co operative Fertilizers Limited (Westco), our joint venture partner in CFL, reached approximately 48% of our total sales volume for the year, which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002. CF Holdings was formed as a Delaware corporation in April 2005 to hold the existing businesses of CF Industries, Inc. On August 16, 2005, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of common stock. We sold 47,437,500 shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately $715.4 million. We did not retain any of the proceeds from our IPO. In connection with our IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction in which CF Industries, Inc. ceased to be a cooperative and became our wholly owned subsidiary. In the reorganization transaction, all of the equity interests in CF Industries, Inc. were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the IPO and 7,562,499 shares of our common stock. In connection with our IPO, the following significant items occurred: In August of 2005, we replaced our $140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility. Also, in August of 2005, we repaid in full $235.6 million of our term notes, plus associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of $29.3 million, with cash on hand and by liquidating short term investments. Prior to that date, we made principal payments of $0.7 million and $10.0 million on their scheduled maturity dates. In connection with these transactions, we incurred a $17.1 million charge (after taxes) related to the prepayment penalties associated with the repayment of our long term debt ($16.0 million) and a non cash charge of $1.1 million (after taxes) related to the write off of unamortized financing fees related to our previous senior secured revolving credit facility and long term debt. Also, in connection with our IPO, our board of directors adopted a plan under which we grant stock based awards to our officers, employees and non employee directors and terminated a previous long term incentive plan. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, stock based awards were granted under this plan. Also, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R Share Based Payment, which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all stock based awards. As a result, the total after tax stock based compensation cost recognized for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $6.1 million, $5.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Most of the stock based compensation cost was recorded as 34 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. selling, general and administrative expenses. We did not have stock based awards prior to our initial public offering. See the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section later in this discussion and analysis for additional information on stock based compensation. In connection with our IPO, we also recorded a charge to the income tax provision of $99.9 million to reduce to zero what remained of the gross deferred tax asset related to CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) as of August 16, 2005 (CF Industries, Inc.s last day as a cooperative). Those net operating loss carryforwards were generated from business conducted with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners while CF Industries, Inc. was a cooperative. In connection with our IPO, we entered into an NOL agreement with the pre IPO owners of CF Industries, Inc. which provides that in the event that it is finally determined by the applicable taxing jurisdictions that CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO NOLs can be utilized, we will pay the pre IPO owners an amount equal to the federal and state income taxes saved by the utilization of the pre IPO NOLs. See Notes 11 and 31 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of the NOL agreement. Post IPO Significant Items 2005 After our IPO in the latter part of 2005, hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico region during the latter portion of 2005 significantly affected the domestic fertilizer industry. These hurricanes caused substantial damage to the natural gas production and distribution facilities in the region, affecting the supply and price of natural gas, the primary raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. By the end of the first quarter of 2006, natural gas prices had moderated, returning to approximately pre hurricane levels. These storms also affected the availability of barges used to transport urea and DAP/MAP on the Mississippi River and adversely affected the supply of sulfur, a raw material used in the production of phosphate fertilizers, by causing refinery closures and transportation disruptions. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we ceased classifying natural gas derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities. As a result, realized and unrealized gains or losses related to our derivatives are now recognized in operations as they occur. Cash flow hedges existing at the time we discontinued hedge accounting were de designated as cash flow hedges. Despite our change in accounting treatment, the execution and attendant economic consequences of our hedging activities have not changed, in that derivatives are still being used to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on forward pricing program (FPP) nitrogen sales. However, because of our change in accounting treatment, gains or losses on natural gas hedges may not be realized in the same period as the FPP sale to which they relate. We also establish natural gas derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our FPP. See Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of derivative financial instruments. We implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN No. 47) in the fourth quarter of 2005. This interpretation of SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations requires us to recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. We identified conditional AROs for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities. Consequently, we recognized an increase in ARO liabilities of $4.6 million, and an increase in deferred tax assets of $1.8 million resulting in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of 35 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. $2.8 million that decreased net earnings. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of AROs. 2006 The domestic nitrogen fertilizer business in 2006 was characterized by adverse conditions early in the year due to the remaining impacts from the 2005 hurricane season and its impact on natural gas pricing due to damage experienced by Gulf of Mexico gas producers. Later in the year, natural gas prices fell, and a tight international market for fertilizer products and an expectation of a stronger planting season in early 2007 led to a stabilization in overall pricing. Results for our phosphate business in 2006 were impacted favorably by increased domestic demand and stable international conditions. Consolidated net sales increased $65.0 million, or 3.3%, in 2006 to $2.0 billion, with increases in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments. Gross margin declined by $62.0 million, or 30%, to $147.2 million. Our 2006 gross margin was impacted by a $30.7 million pre tax charge for unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $21.6 million for adjustments to AROs and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex. Late in 2006, management committed to a plan to relocate its corporate office to Deerfield, Illinois. The move was completed in the first quarter of 2007. 2007 Both the nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer businesses in 2007 were favorably impacted by improved demand and pricing as a robust agricultural economy characterized by strong domestic and international grain markets produced high global demand for fertilizer. Increasing demand pushed average selling prices higher as the year progressed. Consolidated net sales increased by $723.8 million, or 36%, to $2.8 billion in 2007, with increases coming in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments. Gross margin increased by $522.8 million in 2007. Our 2007 gross margin included a $17.0 million pre tax unrealized mark to market gain on natural gas derivatives. During 2007, we completed the purchase of a 50% interest in KEYTRADE AG (Keytrade), a global fertilizer trading company, for $25.9 million, and purchased certain preferred stock in Keytrade for $0.9 million. The investment in Keytrade provides us with a global platform for marketing and sourcing fertilizer. Under this arrangement, we utilize Keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizer products from North America, and Keytrade is now our exclusive importer of UAN products into North America. We also provided $12.8 million in subordinated financing for Keytrade under notes that will mature in September 2017. We report Keytrade as an equity method investment. We periodically review the depreciable lives assigned to our production facilities and related assets, as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our units of production (UOP) depreciation expense, and we change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews. In the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed such a review and, as a result, we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities from ten years to fifteen years. Separately, we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain UOP assets at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex and all UOP assets at our Plant City, Florida phosphate complex. The effect of this change in estimate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 was an increase in earnings before income taxes of $10.3 million, an increase in net earnings of $6.7 million, and an increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.12. Key Industry Factors We operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our products are globally traded commodities and, as a result, we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on 36 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. customer service and product quality. Moreover, our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below. Global Supply & Demand Historically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short term fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption, federal regulations, including requirements mandating increased use of bio fuels, and farm sector income. Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying/selling patterns of key consuming/exporting countries such as China, India or Brazil often play a major role in shaping near term market fundamentals. The economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs, government policies and global trade. Natural Gas Prices Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, urea and UAN. Because all of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada, the price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 50% of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales in 2007 and a higher percentage of cash production costs (total production costs less depreciation and amortization). Farmers Economics The demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. Fertilizer demand has increased in response to increased corn acreage planted to support the growing ethanol industry. Global Trade in Fertilizer In addition to the relationship between global supply and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters. Changes in currency values alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world. Imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela are major exporters to North America. The domestic phosphate fertilizer industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of DAP/MAP. Consequently, phosphate prices and demand for U.S. DAP/MAP are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world 37 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. market including fertilizer and or trade policies of foreign governments, changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations, to name a few. Political and Social Government Policies The political and social policies of governments around the world can result in the restriction of imports, the subsidization of domestic producers and or the subsidization of exports. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives. Factors Affecting Our Results Net Sales. Our net sales are derived from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize. The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers. Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, product purchases and distribution costs. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, maintenance, direct labor and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers. In mid 2003, we instituted a margin risk management approach utilizing our forward pricing program (FPP), which allows us to manage some of the risks created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs. Through our FPP, we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. As our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us, we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative instruments. In the third quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, due to the increased volatility of natural gas prices, we fulfilled a significant amount of FPP orders with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases rather than with manufactured product. See "Forward Pricing Program" later in this discussion and analysis. As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our FPP, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and other payroll related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes, insurance and professional service fees. Our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of the consummation of our IPO. These expenses include additional legal and corporate governance expenses, stock based awards, salary and payroll related costs for additional accounting staff, director compensation, exchange listing fees, transfer agent and stockholder related fees and increased premiums for director and officer liability insurance coverage. Other Operating Net. Other operating net includes the costs associated with our closed Bartow phosphate facility and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations. Bartow facility 38 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. costs include provisions for phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond closure costs, water treatment costs and costs associated with the cessation of operations. The term "other costs" refers to amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business, litigation expenses, gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets and impairment charges for goodwill. Interest Expense. Our interest expense includes the interest on our long term debt and notes payable, annual fees on our senior secured revolving credit facility and amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements. Interest Income. Our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents, investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. Minority Interest. Amounts reported as minority interest represent the 34% minority interest in the net operating results of CFL, our consolidated Canadian joint venture. We own 49% of the voting common stock of CFL and 66% of CFLs non voting preferred stock. Two of our pre IPO owners own 17% of CFLs voting common stock, including GROWMARK which owns 9%. The remaining 34% of the voting common stock and non voting preferred stock of CFL is held by Westco. We designate four members of CFLs nine member board of directors, which also has one member designated by each of our two pre IPO owners that own an interest in CFL and three members designated by Westco. We operate the Medicine Hat facility and purchase approximately 66% of the facilitys ammonia and urea production, pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement. Both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either us or CFL upon a twelve month notice. Westco has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the remaining 34% of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement. To the extent that Westco does not purchase its 34% of the facilitys production, we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts. Since 1995, however, Westco has purchased at least 34% of the facilitys production each year. Under the product purchase agreements, both we and Westco pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases. However, the product purchase agreements also provide that CFL will distribute its net earnings to us and Westco annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from CFL. The distributions to Westco are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, as we consider these payments to be similar to dividends. Our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to CFL in the event that CFL is unable to meet its debts as they become due. The amount of each advance would be related to the amount of product we purchase, or at least 66% of the deficiency, and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66% of Medicine Hats production. A similar obligation also exists for Westco. We and Westco currently manage CFL such that each party is responsible for its share of CFLs fixed costs and that CFLs production volume meets the parties combined requirements. The management agreement, the product purchase agreements and any other agreements related to CFL are subject to change with the consent of both parties. Income Taxes. Our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred United States and Canadian income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income, of an appropriate character, in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a 39 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. deferred tax asset will not be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and non operating net, respectively. Upon the completion of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes. On the date of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. had a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards generated from business conducted with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners. These net operating loss carryforwards totaled $250 million, with expirations ranging from 2021 through 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a charge of $99.9 million to establish a 100% valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these NOLs. The valuation allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized since CF Industries, Inc. is no longer a cooperative for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a net operating loss agreement with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners (NOL Agreement) relating to the future treatment of the pre IPO NOLs. Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the IPO, we will pay to CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved. CFL operates as a cooperative for Canadian income tax purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its customers, including CF Industries, Inc. For Canadian income tax purposes, CFL is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it distributes to its customers, provided that certain requirements are met. As a result, CFL records no income tax provision. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Net of Taxes. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities in which we have an ownership interest and exert significant operational and financial influence. Income taxes related to these investments are reflected in this line. In 2007, the amounts recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of taxes relates to our investment in Keytrade. 40  CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Demand increased due to an increase in corn acreage planted, higher spring season application rates, a strong fall application season driven by favorable weather conditions and expectations of a strong spring season in 2008. Operating results in our phosphate fertilizer business improved due to tight domestic supply/demand conditions, strong worldwide demand and increased domestic demand in the fall. Our total gross margin increased by $522.8 million to $670.0 million for 2007, from a gross margin of $147.2 million for 2006. The increase was due largely to higher average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices, favorable unrealized mark to market adjustments on natural gas derivatives, and higher nitrogen fertilizer sales volume, partially offset by higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs. Net earnings of $372.7 million for 2007 included a net pre tax unrealized mark to market gain of $17.0 million ($11.0 million after tax) on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $1.0 million ($0.7 million after tax) for changes in estimates to our asset retirement obligations (AROs) and demolition costs. Net earnings of $33.3 million for 2006 included a pre tax charge of $30.7 million ($18.7 million after tax) for unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $21.6 million ($13.1 million after tax) for adjustments to AROs and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex. Net Sales Our net sales were $2.8 billion for 2007, or $723.8 million higher than net sales for 2006, due largely to higher average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices and an increase in nitrogen sales volume. Our total sales volume increased 6% to 8.9 million tons for 2007 versus 8.4 million tons for 2006. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume in 2007 increased 628,000 tons, or 10%, to 6.9 million tons for 2007 compared to 6.3 million tons in 2006 due to increased domestic demand and our customers anticipation of a strong spring season in 2008. Our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales was 2.0 million tons for 2007, slightly below the 2.1 million tons sold in 2006. Average nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer selling prices for 2007 were 22% and 46% higher, respectively, than the prices for similar products in 2006 reflecting overall tight market conditions and increased domestic demand. 42 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Cost of Sales Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $230 per ton for 2007 compared to $226 per ton in 2006, an increase of 2%. This increase was largely due to higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs, partially offset by favorable unrealized mark to market adjustments on natural gas derivatives. Phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged $247 per ton for 2007, compared to $221 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 12%. This increase was due mainly to higher purchased product costs, where we purchase finished goods to supplement our production, and higher phosphate rock costs. During 2007, we sold approximately 5.4 million tons of fertilizer under our FPP, representing approximately 60% of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2006, we sold approximately 3.0 million tons of fertilizer under this program, representing approximately 36% of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20% to $65.2 million in 2007 compared to $54.5 million in 2006. The year over year increase in expense for 2007 resulted largely from the increased expenses related to performance based short term management incentive compensation; expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to Deerfield, Illinois; increased compensation costs associated with our long term stock based compensation; expenses related to our Keytrade investment and certain software implementation costs. Other Operating Net Other operating net decreased to $3.2 million in 2007 from $21.4 million in 2006. We recorded a $3.8 million gain on the third quarter 2007 sale of a parcel of land and a warehouse at our closed Bartow, Florida, facility. In conjunction with that sale we reduced the related asset retirement obligations (AROs) by $1.0 million to reflect obligations previously recognized for which we are now no longer responsible. On an annual basis, we review all aspects of the closed Bartow complex with respect to AROs and other plant site closure related activities. As a result of our year end 2007 review, as well as other reviews performed during the year, we recorded net upward adjustments of $0.8 million to other Bartow AROs during 2007. This upward adjustment excluded the $1.0 million reduction due to the sale of the land and warehouse previously mentioned. In 2006, we recorded a charge of $14.9 million, primarily in the fourth quarter, to reflect revised estimates for water treatment and phosphogypsum stack system closure costs, and plant closure costs. These Bartow related charges pertained to additional water treatment costs to accommodate closure of the cooling pond, additional phosphogypsum stack system closure costs associated with the cooling channel as well as higher costs for previously identified activities and additional costs related to site closure activities, including closure of wastewater treatment systems and storm water management. We also recorded a $3.3 million charge, again primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006, for additional planned demolition activities at Bartow. In 2007, we recorded a $1.5 million charge for revised estimates of environmental remediation requirements at our previously closed Ahoskie, North Carolina nitrogen manufacturing facility. For a detailed explanation of the accounting for AROs at Bartow, please refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Interest Net Interest net increased to $22.7 million of net interest income in 2007 from $9.6 million of net interest income in 2006. Interest income increased to $24.4 million in 2007 from $12.5 million in 2006 due to higher average balances of invested cash partially offset by lower average rates of return. The decrease in the average rates of return is due to substantially all of our short term investments for 2007 43 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. being in securities that are exempt from federal taxation. Interest expense decreased 41% to $1.7 million in 2007, from $2.9 million in 2006. This decrease was primarily due to $1.0 million of interest expense recorded in the second quarter of 2006 related to a Canadian income tax matter. Minority Interest Amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFLs common and preferred shares. The increase in 2007 was due to CFL operating results. The improvement in CFL operating results reflects stronger market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers produced in Canada. Income Taxes Our income tax provision for 2007 was $199.5 million, or an effective tax rate of 34.9%. This compared with a tax provision of $19.7 million on pre tax earnings for 2006, or an effective tax rate of 37.2%. The 2007 decrease in the effective tax rate results principally from the impact of an increase in the U.S. domestic production activities deduction and non taxable interest income earned on short term investments. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Net of Taxes Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of taxes for 2007 consists of our share of the operating results of Keytrade for the period we held the investment in 2007. The amounts recorded in 2007 include a deferred U.S. income tax provision of $0.7 million on our share of the earnings. Diluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share and Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted net earnings per share increased to $6.57 per share for 2007 from $0.60 per share for 2006 primarily due to the increase in net earnings, partially offset by an increase in the diluted weighted average shares of outstanding common stock. The increase in the diluted weighted average shares of outstanding common stock in 2007 versus 2006 is due to the impact of stock option and restricted stock activity in 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Consolidated Operating Results In 2006, the domestic nitrogen fertilizer industry was characterized by adverse conditions early in the year remaining from the 2005 effects of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, more moderate conditions through the fall and strength late in the year fueled by lower natural gas prices, a tight international market and expectations of a strong planting season in the spring of 2007. The first half of 2006 was unfavorably impacted by high natural gas prices during the first quarter of the year and reduced demand during the spring planting season. Results during 2006 for our phosphate fertilizer business were affected positively by increased domestic demand and relatively balanced international supply/demand conditions. Our total gross margin decreased by approximately $62.0 million, or 30%, to $147.2 million for 2006 compared to a gross margin of $209.2 million for 2005. The net earnings of $33.3 million for 2006 included a pre tax charge of $30.7 million for unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $21.6 million for adjustments to AROs and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex. The net loss of $39.0 million for 2005 included a $99.9 million charge to record a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards generated during pre IPO years, a $28.3 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, a gain of approximately $14.0 million associated with the early termination of certain natural gas hedge positions, a pre tax charge of $9.3 million for unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives, a pre tax charge of $12.8 million for 44 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. upward adjustments to AROs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex and a $6.1 million tax benefit from a refund of Canadian income taxes. Net Sales Our net sales were $2.0 billion for both 2006 and 2005. Lower nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes were offset by higher average selling prices for ammonia and phosphate fertilizers in 2006. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 119,000 tons, or 2%, to 6.3 million tons for 2006 compared to 6.4 million tons in 2005, due primarily to the cessation of production by U.S. Agri Chemicals to whom we had sold ammonia previously. Our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 2.1 million tons for 2006 approximated the amount sold in 2005. Nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices for 2006 averaged 3% and 7% higher, respectively, than the prices for similar products in 2005. Cost of Sales Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $226 per ton for 2006 compared to $207 per ton in 2005, an increase of 9%, primarily due to higher natural gas costs and higher purchased product costs. Phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged $221 per ton for 2006 compared to $211 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 5%, mainly due to higher ammonia and sulfur costs. During 2006, we sold approximately 3.0 million tons of fertilizer under our FPP, representing approximately 36% of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2005, we sold approximately 5.2 million tons of fertilizer under this program, representing approximately 62% of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period. The lower level of FPP sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those periods. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% to $54.5 million in 2006 compared to $57.0 million in 2005. The year over year decrease in expense for 2006 resulted largely from the absence of expenses related to our August 2005 IPO, including expenses associated with the termination of a long term incentive plan upon completion of our IPO. This decrease was partially offset by additional stock based compensation expense and additional administrative expenses associated with being a publicly held company. Other Operating Net Other operating net increased to $21.4 million in 2006 from $14.1 million in 2005. On an annual basis, we review all aspects of the closed Bartow complex with respect to AROs and other plant site closure related activities. As a result of our 2006 review, we revised our estimates for water treatment and phosphogypsum stack system closure costs, as well as costs to close the Bartow plant site. Additional costs were identified that will be incurred to treat water to accommodate closure of the cooling pond. Estimated phosphogypsum stack system closure costs associated with the cooling channel increased due to additional closure work and higher costs for previously identified activities. We also identified additional costs related to site closure activities, including closure of wastewater treatment systems as well as storm water management. Consequently, we recorded a charge of $14.9 million, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006, to reflect these revised estimates. We also recorded a $3.3 million charge, again primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006, for additional planned demolition activities at Bartow. In 2005, $11.1 million of adjustments to Bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement costs were recorded as a result of revised engineering estimates prepared in connection with the preparation of a revised closure plan for the Plant City phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond 45 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. system. For a detailed explanation of the accounting for AROs at Bartow, please refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Interest Net Net interest income increased to $9.6 million in 2006 from $0.6 million in 2005. Interest expense decreased 79% to $2.9 million in 2006 from $14.0 million in 2005, due to the full repayment of our term notes, using our cash and short term investments. This decrease was partially offset by $1.0 million of interest expense in the second quarter of 2006 related to a Canadian tax matter. Interest income decreased to $12.5 million in 2006 from $14.6 million in 2005 as higher average rates of return were more than offset by lower average balances of invested cash. Minority Interest Amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFLs common and preferred shares. The increase in 2006 was due to improved 2006 CFL operating results. The improvement in CFL operating results reflects stronger market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers produced in Canada. Income Taxes Our income tax provision for 2006 was $19.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 37.2%. This compared with a tax provision of $128.7 million on pre tax earnings for 2005. For 2005, the income tax provision of $128.7 million included the following items: income tax expense of $35.4 million on earnings before income taxes; a charge of $99.9 million to establish a valuation allowance, as previously discussed; a tax benefit of $0.5 million for adjustments to prior years tax returns; and a tax benefit related to a Canadian income tax refund of $6.1 million. Our effective tax rate (exclusive of the $99.9 million non cash charge and the $6.1 million refund of Canadian income taxes) was 37.8%. The decrease in the effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes results principally from lower state income taxes. Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle Net of Taxes In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded additional asset retirement obligations due to implementation of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations and recorded a related charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle reduced net earnings in 2005 by $2.8 million. For a discussion of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, please see the Company History section of the "Overview" section of this discussion and analysis. Diluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share and Diluted Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted net earnings per share improved to $0.60 in 2006 from a $0.71 loss per share in 2005, as calculated on a pro forma basis, primarily due to net earnings of $33.3 million generated in 2006 as compared to the net loss of $39.0 million incurred in 2005. Diluted weighted average shares of outstanding common stock in 2006 approximated the 2005 level. 46  CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Operating Results by Business Segment Our business is organized and managed internally based on two segments, the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business, which are differentiated primarily by their products, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate. Nitrogen Fertilizer Business The following table presents summary operating data for our nitrogen fertilizer business: Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2007 v. 2006 2006 v. 2005 (in millions, except as noted) Net sales $ 2,041.9 $ 1,521.9 $ 1,506.8 $ 520.0 $ 15.1 Cost of sales 1,595.1 1,423.4 1,333.9 171.7 89.5 Gross margin $ 446.8 $ 98.5 $ 172.9 $ 348.3 $ (74.4 ) Gross margin percentage 21.9 % 6.5 % 11.5 % Tons of product sold (000s) 6,938 6,310 6,429 628 (119 ) Sales volume by product (000s) Ammonia 1,434 1,226 1,382 208 (156 ) Urea 2,701 2,619 2,518 82 101 UAN 2,754 2,420 2,483 334 (63 ) Other nitrogen products 49 45 46 4 (1 ) Average selling price per ton by product Ammonia $ 388 $ 362 $ 317 $ 26 $ 45 Urea 329 251 251 78 UAN 215 172 174 43 (2 ) Cost of natural gas (per MMBtu)(1) Donaldsonville $ 7.81 $ 7.20 $ 7.12 $ 0.61 $ 0.08 Medicine Hat 6.24 6.56 6.83 (0.32 ) (0.27 ) Average daily market price of natural gas (per MMBtu) Henry Hub (Louisiana) $ 6.93 $ 6.74 $ 8.86 $ 0.19 $ (2.12 ) AECO (Alberta) 5.99 5.76 7.26 0.23 (1.50 ) Depreciation and amortization $ 50.4 $ 59.2 $ 63.0 $ (8.8 ) $ (3.8 ) Capital expenditures $ 61.1 $ 26.0 $ 46.3 $ 35.1 $ (20.3 ) Production volume by product (000s) Ammonia(2)(3) 3,289 3,158 2,778 131 380 Granular urea(2) 2,358 2,334 2,065 24 269 UAN (28%) 2,611 2,336 2,256 275 80 We have corrected our previously presented 2006 and 2005 nitrogen segment financial results to include shipping and handling amounts that were billed to our customers in net sales. Previously, we reported these shipping and handling amounts as a reduction of cost of sales. The correction did not change our previously presented gross margin, but did change our previously presented gross margin percentage and average selling prices. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional discussion of this correction. (1)Includes the cost of natural gas purchases and realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives. (2)Total production at Donaldsonville and Medicine Hat, including the 34% interest of Westco, our joint venture partner in CFL. (3)Gross ammonia production, including amounts subsequently upgraded on site into urea and or UAN. 47  CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Sales. Nitrogen fertilizer net sales increased 34% to $2.0 billion in 2007, compared to $1.5 billion in 2006, due to higher average selling prices as well as higher sales volume. The 7% increase in average ammonia selling prices for 2007, arising mainly in the fourth quarter, was driven primarily by tight supplies heading into the quarter and a strong fall application season. Higher average urea selling prices reflected continued strong domestic and international demand. The 25% increase in average UAN selling prices for 2007 compared to 2006 reflected strong domestic demand and a tight supply/demand balance. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume increased 10% to 6.9 million tons in 2007 compared to 6.3 million tons in 2006. The increase was due to the impact of an increase in corn acres planted and higher fertilizer application rates in the spring, as well as a strong fall ammonia application season and demand in anticipation of a strong spring 2008 planting season. The increase in corn acreage was driven by greater demand by ethanol producers, low corn inventories and continued strong demand for feed. Cost of Sales. Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $230 per ton for 2007, compared to $226 per ton for 2006, an increase of 2%, largely due to higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs, partially offset by favorable unrealized mark to market adjustments on natural gas derivatives. The costs of finished fertilizer products purchased for resale were approximately $57.6 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 due to an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products as well as the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices, both factors occurring mainly during the last six months of 2007. The overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our Donaldsonville facility and CFLs Medicine Hat facility, including realized gains and losses on derivatives, increased by 4% in 2007 versus the cost in 2006. The increase in realized gas costs was due mainly to greater net realized losses on our natural gas derivatives. We carry our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur. We recognized a net $17.0 million unrealized mark to market gain in 2007 compared to a net $30.7 million unrealized mark to market loss in 2006. During 2007, we sold approximately 4.6 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our FPP, representing approximately 66% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2006, we sold approximately 2.7 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 44% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Sales. Nitrogen fertilizer net sales were $1.5 billion for both 2006 and 2005, as higher average ammonia selling prices in 2006 were, for the most part, offset by lower sales volume. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 2% to 6.3 million tons in 2006 compared to 6.4 million tons in 2005. Ammonia and UAN sales volumes decreased by 11% and 3%, respectively, for 2006 compared to the prior year while urea sales volume increased by 4%. Ammonia sales volumes decreased due primarily to lower sales from our Tampa terminal due to U.S. Agri Chemicals, a former customer, ceasing phosphate operations in 2005. Increases in industry consumption in the fall in anticipation of strong corn and wheat prices offset a spring during which the industry experienced fewer corn acres planted and reduced application rates. The decrease in UAN sales compared to sales for 2005 was due primarily to less corn acreage planted and reduced demand in the southern portion of the country due to drought conditions, both experienced during the first half of 2006. The impact of these factors was partially offset by strong summer and fall fill demand resulting from the anticipation of a stronger UAN market later in 2006 and into the spring of 2007. Ammonia sales prices increased by 14% for 2006 compared 48 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. to the prior year, primarily due to tight world market conditions and strong fourth quarter domestic demand. Cost of Sales. Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $226 per ton for 2006, compared to $207 per ton for 2005, an increase of 9%, largely due to realized losses and unfavorable unrealized mark to market adjustments related to natural gas derivatives, and higher purchased product costs. While the overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our Donaldsonville facility and CFLs Medicine Hat facility decreased by 1% for 2006 versus the cost in 2005, the favorable effect of this variance was more than offset by the impact of the realized losses on natural gas derivatives immediately recognized in cost of sales. We recognized $30.7 million of unrealized mark to market losses on derivatives in 2006 compared to $9.3 million in 2005 due to our discontinuing hedge accounting in the last quarter of 2005, and the decline in natural gas prices that occurred during the respective periods. We also recorded approximately $14.0 million of hedge gains in 2005, mainly in the third quarter. The costs of finished fertilizer products purchased for resale were approximately $8.9 million higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices as well as an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products, both factors occurring mainly during the first six months of 2006. See the "Overview" section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about the impact of accounting for our natural gas derivatives. During 2006, we sold approximately 2.7 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our FPP, representing approximately 44% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2005, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period. The lower level of FPP sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those respective periods. 49  CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Phosphate Fertilizer Business The following table presents summary operating data for our phosphate fertilizer business: Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2007 v. 2006 2006 v. 2005 (in millions, except as noted) Net sales $ 714.8 $ 511.0 $ 461.1 $ 203.8 $ 49.9 Cost of sales 491.6 462.3 424.8 29.3 37.5 Gross margin $ 223.2 $ 48.7 $ 36.3 $ 174.5 $ 12.4 Gross margin percentage 31.2 % 9.5 % 7.9 % Tons of product sold (000s) 1,994 2,090 2,009 (96 ) 81 Sales volume by product (000s) DAP 1,624 1,676 1,583 (52 ) 93 MAP 370 414 426 (44 ) (12 ) Domestic vs export sales of DAP/MAP (000s) Domestic 1,557 1,447 1,392 110 55 Export 437 643 617 (206 ) 26 Average selling price per ton by product DAP $ 357 $ 243 $ 227 $ 114 $ 16 MAP 366 251 239 115 12 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 31.5 $ 33.1 $ 32.0 $ (1.6 ) $ 1.1 Capital expenditures $ 39.9 $ 32.2 $ 25.6 $ 7.7 $ 6.6 Production volume by product (000s) Phosphate rock 3,233 3,805 3,647 (572 ) 158 Sulfuric acid 2,531 2,598 2,507 (67 ) 91 Phosphoric acid as P2O5(1) 976 1,009 978 (33 ) 31 DAP/MAP 1,948 2,023 1,945 (75 ) 78 We have corrected our previously presented 2006 and 2005 phosphate segment financial results to include shipping and handling amounts that were billed to our customers in net sales. Previously, we reported these shipping and handling amounts as a reduction of cost of sales. The correction did not change our previously presented gross margin, but did change our previously presented gross margin percentage and average selling prices. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional discussion of this correction. (1)P2O5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Sales. Phosphate fertilizer net sales increased 40% to $714.8 million for 2007 compared to $511.0 million in 2006, due to higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volume. Average phosphate fertilizer selling prices during 2007 increased by 46% compared to prices in 2006. The increase was driven by strong domestic demand and reduced domestic production volumes (relative to historic levels) leading to a tight domestic supply/demand balance. Our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 2.0 million tons in 2007 decreased 5% compared to 2.1 million tons in 2006. Export sales of DAP and MAP declined by 206,000 tons primarily from reduced availability of product due to 50 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. scheduled first quarter maintenance activity at our Plant City, Florida phosphate complex, along with supply being made available for second quarter domestic sales in anticipation of increased domestic demand. Effective November 30, 2007, we terminated our membership in PhosChem and we no longer utilize this sales association to export phosphate fertilizers. Keytrade has become our sole exporter of phosphate fertilizers. Cost of Sales. Phosphate cost of sales averaged $247 per ton for 2007 compared to $221 per ton for 2006. The 12% increase was due mainly to higher purchased product costs and higher phosphate rock costs, as well as higher sulfur costs. Purchased product costs were approximately $13.4 million higher in 2007 than in the same period of 2006, primarily due to an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products, mainly occurring during the second quarter of 2007. Higher per ton phosphate rock mining costs were due to fewer tons mined in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting from unfavorable mining conditions as well as higher earthmoving costs for land management. Average annual sulfur costs increased by 10% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase, mainly occurring in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflected the impact of a strengthening domestic sulfur market fueled by strong demand and insufficient supply. We expect the domestic and international sulfur markets to remain tight in 2008 due to strong anticipated demand from phosphate fertilizer and metal producers. During 2007, we sold approximately 835,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under our FPP, representing approximately 42% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2006, we sold approximately 294,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under this program, representing approximately 14% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net Sales. Phosphate fertilizer net sales increased 11% to $511.0 million for 2006 compared to $461.1 million in 2005, due to higher average selling prices and increased sales volumes. Average phosphate fertilizer prices during 2006 increased by 7% compared to prices in 2005 due to the impact of increased domestic demand on what was already a relatively tight supply/demand balance. Our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales volumes of 2.1 million tons in 2006 increased by 4% over the prior years level due primarily to stronger domestic demand for DAP during the second half of the year. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we made our first DAP export sales through PhosChem, an export association representing North American phosphate producers. We joined PhosChem in October of 2006. Approximately 22% of our 2006 fourth quarter phosphate fertilizer net sales were made through PhosChem. Cost of Sales. Phosphate cost of sales averaged $221 per ton for 2006 compared to $211 per ton for 2005. The 5% increase was mainly due to higher ammonia and sulfur costs. Ammonia prices increased by 6% during 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting stronger global market conditions through the first half of 2006. Sulfur costs increased by 3% for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase, mainly occurring in the first six months of 2006, reflected the lingering impact of supply disruptions that occurred in 2005 due to hurricane activity. During 2006, we sold approximately 294,000 tons of phosphate fertilizers under our FPP, representing approximately 14% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2005, we sold approximately 718,000 tons of phosphate fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 36% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period. The lower level of FPP sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during those respective periods. 51 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of cash is cash from operations, which includes customer advances. Our primary uses of cash are operating costs, working capital needs, capital expenditures and dividends. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices for our products, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonality factors inherent in the business. We invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations, and money market funds. Securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the U.S. government, those issued by state, local or other governmental entities, and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities. Cash Balances As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents of $366.5 million and a $305.8 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our forward pricing program. As of December 31, 2006, the comparable amounts were $25.4 million and $102.7 million. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had $219.8 million and $176.4 million available, respectively, under our senior secured revolving credit facility (credit facility). Short Term Investments We had short term investments of $494.5 million as of December 31, 2007 and $300.2 million as of December 31, 2006. In 2007, our short term investments generally were available for sale tax exempt auction rate securities. Auction rate securities primarily are debt instruments with long term maturities for which interest rates are reset periodically through an auction process, which typically occurs every 7 to 35 days. The auction process results in the interest rate being reset on the underlying securities until the next reset or auction date. This date is also referred to as the remarketing date, since the holder of the instrument can decide at each auction date to continue to hold the security or allow others to bid for it resulting in liquidation of the original holders position. Parties bid for these instruments and the lowest interest rate that places all of the securities offered for auction becomes the interest rate earned until the next auction date. A failed auction occurs when there are insufficient bids for the number of instruments being offered. When a failed auction occurs, the present holders of the instruments continue to hold them until the next auction date. Upon a failed auction, the instrument carries an interest rate based upon certain predefined formulas or a fixed rate. On December 31, 2007, the auction rate securities that we held were issued by various state or local governmental entities, including securities that are backed by student loans that are guaranteed under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Through February 5, 2008, we had not experienced any failed auctions in these securities and subsequent to December 31, 2007 through February 5, 2008, we sold certain of these investments through the auction process. In February 2008, the market for these securities began to show signs of illiquidity and auctions for several securities failed on their scheduled auction dates. As a result, we continue to hold investments in certain of these securities. These investments, for which auctions have failed, are no longer liquid investments and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as an auction of these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside of the auction process. In accordance with our policies, we review the underlying securities and assess the creditworthiness of these investments. In each case, our review found these investments to be investment grade and in compliance with our investment policy. At February 22, 2008, we continue to hold $276 million of investments in auction rate securities and for $159 million of this amount, the most recent auction failed. We believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets supporting the auction rate securities has not been impacted by the current market illiquidity. Currently, the market continues to show signs of illiquidity and we have not assessed the impact of the illiquid market on the value of the securities. It is reasonably possible that a change 52 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. in the estimated value of these instruments could occur after an evaluation is completed in the future. For those instruments with recent failed auctions, we believe we have the ability to hold these securities until market liquidity returns and the auction process resumes, and we presently intend to hold the securities until such time. We do not believe the current market liquidity issues in these securities present any operating liquidity issues for the Company. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, operating cash flow, and credit available under our credit facilities are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Debt Notes payable, representing amounts owed by CFL to its minority interest holder with respect to advances, were $4.9 million as of December 31, 2007 and $4.2 million as of December 31, 2006. There were no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit under our $250 million credit facility as of December 31, 2007 or December 31, 2006. On August 16, 2005, we replaced our $140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a new $250 million credit facility. The credit facility, as amended on September 7, 2005 and July 31, 2007, is scheduled to be available until July 31, 2012 and bears interest at a variable rate. This facility is secured by working capital, certain equipment and the Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex. Our investment in and advances to Keytrade will be pledged as security under our credit facility. The credit facility provides up to $250 million, subject to a borrowing base, for working capital and general corporate purposes, including up to $50 million for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had $219.8 million and $176.4 million available, respectively, under our credit facility. See Note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information concerning this credit facility. Investment in Keytrade In October 2007, we purchased 50% of the common shares of KEYTRADE AG (Keytrade), a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland for $25.9 million. We also purchased certain non voting preferred shares of Keytrade for $0.9 million and contributed an additional $12.8 million in subordinated financing. The subordinated financing is in the form of notes that mature September 30, 2017 and bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. The investment in Keytrade provides us with a global platform for marketing and sourcing fertilizer. Under the terms of a commercial agreement we executed with Keytrade concurrent with our investment, we utilize Keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizer products from North America and as our exclusive importer of UAN products into North America. We terminated our previous membership in PhosChem and no longer utilize them to export phosphate fertilizers. We account for Keytrade as an equity method investment. See Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information concerning the Keytrade investment. Capital Spending Capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base, to increase our capacity and to improve plant efficiency. In response to the difficult industry environment prior to 2004, we had deferred non essential capital expenditures whenever it was possible to do so without compromising the operational integrity of our facilities or the safety of our employees. Of the $45.5 million increase in capital expenditures in 2007 as compared to 2006, approximately $24 million related to plant and equipment expenditures and $22 million related to greater plant turnaround activity during 2007. We 53 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. expect to spend approximately $140 million to $170 million on capital expenditures in both 2008 and 2009. The projection for 2008 includes approved spending on long term projects initiated in 2007 and earlier. These amounts also include approximately $17 million in 2008 and $30 million in 2009 for capital expenditures at CFL, of which we are obligated to fund 66%. Forward Pricing Program (FPP) We offer a FPP to our customers under which product may be ordered for future delivery, with a significant portion of the sales proceeds generally being collected before the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had approximately $305.8 million and $102.7 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had approximately 3.0 million and 1.7 million tons of product, respectively, committed to be sold under the FPP. Most of this product was scheduled to ship within 150 days of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Customer advances were a significant source of liquidity and cash flow from operations in 2007. The level of sales under the FPP is affected by many factors, including current market conditions and our customers perceptions of future market fundamentals. The higher level of sales on order as of December 31, 2007 reflects our customers expectations concerning the fertilizer pricing environment and availability of supply prevalent during that reporting period. The level of our customers participation in our FPP may vary over time. Should the level of participation decrease, there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings and timing of cash flow of future periods. If the level of sales under the FPP were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease, and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Also, borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary. Due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future FPP sales activity. Financial Assurance Requirements In addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate fertilizer business, we are subject to financial assurance requirements. Previously, these financial assurance requirements were satisfied without the need for any advance expenditure of corporate funds provided our financial statements met certain criteria, referred to as the financial tests. However, pursuant to a 2005 amendment to the Florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure of phosphogypsum stacks, we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations. This was done in order to take advantage of a safe harbor provision in the regulations that would obviate the need for us to meet the financial test criteria in the future. We made annual contributions of $9.4 million and $11.1 million in February of 2007 and March of 2006, respectively, to this escrow account, which by rule is earmarked to cover the closure, long term maintenance, and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks, as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure. In the first quarter of 2008, we expect to contribute another $6.2 million. Over the subsequent eight years, we expect to contribute between $4.0 million and $5.0 million annually based upon the required funding formula as defined in the regulations and an assumed rate of return of 4% on invested funds. The amount of money that will accumulate in the account by the year 2016, including interest earned on invested funds, is currently estimated to be approximately $79 million. After 2016, contributions to the account are estimated to average less than $3.0 million annually for the following 17 years. The balance in the account is estimated to be approximately $212 million by 2033. The amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in Note 9 to our 54 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. These expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the account, which are based on the guidelines set forth in the Florida regulations. Ultimately, the cash in this account will be used to settle the asset retirement obligations. Additionally, Florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities. We will be subject to this requirement, if and when we are able to expand our Hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted. The demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in Florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a cash deposit arrangement. Based on these current regulations, we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in Florida utilizing either of these methods. Other Liquidity Requirements We paid cash dividends of $4.5 million on outstanding common stock during 2007. This amount represents an annual rate equal to $0.08 per common share. In February of 2008, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.02 to $0.10 per common share. We expect to pay quarterly dividends at such a rate for the foreseeable future. Under certain conditions, our $250 million credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends. We also funded contributions to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans totaling $12.0 million in 2007. We expect to contribute $8.0 million to our pension plans in 2008. Cash Flows Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2007 was $690.1 million compared to $203.6 million in 2006. The $486.5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was due primarily to a $339.4 million increase in net earnings and a $162.5 million increase in cash generated by working capital changes. The $162.5 million increase in cash generated by working capital changes is the difference between the $153.8 million generated in 2007 and the $8.7 million consumed in 2006. During 2007, the cash generated by the $203.1 million increase in customer advances and the $31.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was partially offset by a $53.6 million increase in inventories and a $28.5 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in customer advances was due to an increase in the level of forward sales under our FPP and higher average contracted selling prices. Remaining unpaid amounts of customer advances are generally collected by the time the product is shipped. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is primarily due to an increase in nitrogen fertilizer product purchases. The increase in inventories was due to increased prices for purchased product, higher manufacturing costs for phosphate products and higher quantities of both nitrogen and phosphate products held at December 31, 2007. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in amounts due from our minority interest partner. The use of $8.7 million in cash in 2006 for working capital changes was primarily due to a $62.4 million increase in accounts receivable and a $28.9 million decrease in customer advances, partially offset by a $51.6 million decrease in inventories and a $17.1 million decrease in margin deposits. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher volume shipped under normal commercial terms. The decrease in customer advances was due primarily to changes in the product mix of outstanding orders and lower average contract prices. The decrease in inventories reflects lower per unit nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing cost and lower quantities of phosphate fertilizers held at December 31, 2006. The decrease in margin deposits was primarily due to lower margin requirements. 55 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2006 was $203.6 million compared to $137.2 million in 2005. The $66.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was primarily due to $96.0 million less cash used to fund working capital in 2006, partially offset by lower operating earnings in 2006. The $96.0 million reduction in cash used to fund working capital is the difference between $8.7 million used in 2006 and $104.7 million consumed in 2005. During 2006, accounts receivable increased by $62.4 million and customer advances decreased by $28.9 million, resulting in a net use of cash of $91.3 million, which was partially offset by a $51.6 million decrease in inventories and a $17.1 million decrease in margin deposits. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher volume shipped under normal commercial terms. A significant portion of the sales proceeds for volumes shipped under the FPP is generally received prior to shipment. The decrease in customer advances was due primarily to changes in the product mix of outstanding orders and lower per unit contract prices. The decrease in inventories reflects lower per unit nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing cost and lower quantities of phosphate fertilizers held at December 31, 2006. The decrease in margin deposits was primarily due to lower margin requirements. The use of $104.7 million in cash in 2005 for working capital changes was primarily due to a $79.9 million decrease in customer advances and a $14.8 million change in net product exchanges assets. The decrease in customer advances was primarily due to lower levels of forward sales on order as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004. Investing Activities Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 Net cash used in investing activities was $343.1 million in 2007 and $191.3 million in 2006, as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $139.3 million in 2005. The $151.8 million increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 was primarily due to net purchases of short term investments of $194.3 million during 2007 as compared to $120.9 million of net purchases during 2006, resulting from increased operating earnings in 2007 net of other investing activities. The $330.6 million swing in cash used in investing activities in 2006 from 2005, was primarily due to the liquidation of short term investments which was used to fund the $235.6 million prepayment of our term notes in 2005, as previously discussed. Additions to property, plant and equipment accounted for $105.1 million, $59.6 million, and $72.2 million of cash used in investing activities in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The increase in additions to property, plant and equipment in 2007 as compared to 2006 included a $23.9 million increase in capital projects as well as a $22.0 million increase in plant turnaround related expenditures. The decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment in 2006 was due primarily to a $15.5 million decrease in plant turnaround related expenditures incurred during 2006 as compared to 2005. As previously discussed, we made annual contributions of $9.4 million in February of 2007 and $11.1 million in March of 2006 to our asset retirement obligation escrow account. The balance in this account is reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates of $39.6 million in 2007 represents our investment in Keytrade and funding of related subordinated debt. The $18.6 million of proceeds from the sale of unconsolidated affiliates represents the cash realized from the July 15, 2005 sale of our interest in the CF Martin Sulphur, L.P. joint venture (now Martin Sulphur) to our joint venture partner, an affiliate of Martin Resource Management. 56  CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Financing Activities Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 Net cash used in financing activities was $4.9 million, $23.3 million and $290.7 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The $18.4 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2007 versus 2006 was due to the impact of activity related to stock based compensation, partially offset by higher distributions to minority interest. We received $16.6 million of proceeds from stock options exercised under the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan during 2007. Distributions to minority interest were higher in 2007 due to the improvement in CFLs 2006 net earnings (distributed in 2007) as compared to CFLs 2005 net earnings (distributed in 2006). The $267.4 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2006 versus 2005 was primarily due to the 2005 repayment of $235.6 million of our term debt and the associated prepayment penalty of $26.4 million as previously discussed. Distributions to minority interest were higher in 2006, as all of CFLs 2005 net earnings were distributed in 2006, whereas most of CFLs 2004 net earnings were distributed in 2004. The $715.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the corresponding exchange of stock represent the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in the third quarter of 2005 and the subsequent payments to our pre IPO owners. See the "Overview" section of this discussion and analysis for additional information about our IPO. Obligations Contractual Obligations The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007: Payments Due by Period 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Total (in millions) Contractual Obligations Debt Long term debt, (1) $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Notes payable (2) 4.9 4.9 Interest payments on long term debt and notes payable (1) 0.4 0.4 0.8 Other Obligations Operating leases 26.4 21.2 16.7 6.0 4.2 7.9 82.4 Equipment purchases and plant improvements 23.8 15.0 38.8 Transportation (3) 57.6 41.5 22.1 16.2 16.9 217.8 372.1 Purchase obligations (4)(5)(6) 404.9 121.4 52.3 1.6 1.6 3.6 585.4 Keytrade Commerical Agreement (7) 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.1 13.3 Contributions to pension plans (8) 8.0 8.0 Total(9) $ 523.9 $ 192.2 $ 108.9 $ 26.6 $ 24.8 $ 229.3 $ 1,105.7 (1)Based on debt balances and interest rates as of December 31, 2007. All our long term debt was repaid on August 17, 2005. See the "Overview" section of this discussion and analysis for further information on the transaction. 57 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. (2)Represents notes payable to the CFL minority interest holder. While the entire principal amount is due December 31, 2009, CFL may prepay all or a portion of the principal at its sole option. (3)Includes anticipated expenditures under certain requirements contracts to transport raw materials and finished product between our facilities. The majority of these arrangements allow for reductions in usage based on our actual operating rates. Amounts set forth above are based on projected normal operating rates and contracted or current spot prices, where applicable, as of December 31, 2007 and actual operating rates and prices may differ. (4)Includes minimum commitments to purchase natural gas based on prevailing NYMEX forward prices at December 31, 2007. Also includes minimum commitments to purchase ammonia and urea for resale and commitments to purchase ammonia and sulfur for use in phosphate fertilizer production. The amounts set forth above for these commitments are based on spot prices as of December 31, 2007 and actual prices may differ. (5)Liquid markets exist for the possible resale of the natural gas, ammonia and urea purchased for resale and ammonia and sulfur purchased for use in phosphate fertilizer production under most of these commitments, but gains or losses could be incurred on resale. (6)Purchase obligations do not include any amounts related to our financial hedges (i.e. swaps) associated with natural gas purchases. (7)Represents the minimum contractual commitment to Keytrade for handling UAN import and phosphate export transactions per the terms of a commercial agreement we have with Keytrade. (8)Represents the contributions we expect to make to our pension plans in 2008. Our pension funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum legal funding requirements plus discretionary amounts that we may deem to be appropriate. (9)Excludes $0.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty in the timing of payments, if any, on these items. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of these unrecognized tax benefits. 58  CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Other Long Term Obligations As of December 31, 2007, our other liabilities included balances related to asset retirement obligations (AROs) and environmental remediation liabilities and shutdown costs. The estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows: Payments Due by Period 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Total (in millions) Other Long Term Obligations Asset retirement obligations (1)(2) $ 15.4 $ 9.3 $ 6.5 $ 3.7 $ 2.7 $ 596.7 $ 634.3 Environmental remediation liabilities and shutdown costs 1.3 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 5.1 8.0 Total $ 16.7 $ 9.7 $ 6.9 $ 4.1 $ 3.1 $ 601.8 $ 642.3 (1)Represents the undiscounted, inflation adjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the AROs. The corresponding present value of these future expenditures is $89.4 million as of December 31, 2007. We also have unrecorded AROs at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex, at CFLs Medicine Hat facility and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included is reclamation of land and, in the case of Donaldsonville, reclamation of two effluent ponds. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in 2007 dollars is between $15 million and $20 million. Currently, we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities. Therefore, the table above does not contain any cash flows for these AROs. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of our AROs. As described in "Financial Assurance Requirements," we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in an escrow account established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack system. This account will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the AROs pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack system. (2)Cash flows occurring after 2012 are detailed in the following table. The following table details the undiscounted, inflation adjusted estimated cash flows after 2012 required to settle the recorded AROs, as discussed above. Payments Due by Period 201323 202430 203134 203542 204347 After 2047 Total (in millions) Asset retirement obligations after 2012 $ 38.0 $ 12.6 $ 100.1 $ 121.1 $ 33.7 $ 291.2 $ 596.7 59 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer, and a corporate office lease. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to five years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from one to three years. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements at several of our distribution locations, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party. In 2006, we entered into a ten year operating lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters located in Deerfield, IL. The corporate office lease agreement includes leasehold incentives, rent holidays and scheduled rent increases that are expensed on a straight line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 13 Accounting for Leases. Our other operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents, leasehold incentives, rent holidays, scheduled rent increases, concessions or unusual provisions. See Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information concerning leases. We do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when title is transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, rebates, or creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change as market conditions change. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statement of operations. Assets Held for Sale In 2006, we decided to sell our corporate office facility located in Long Grove, Illinois and in 2007 we relocated our corporate headquarters to Deerfield, Illinois. As of December 31, 2007, the net book value of the Long Grove building and related land ($6.7 million) are classified as assets held for sale. At the time the asset was classified as an asset held for sale, the estimated selling price, less the cost to sell the facility, was in excess of the book value. As a result, no loss was recognized. See Note 15 to our 60 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information concerning these assets. Useful Lives of Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using either the straight line method or the units of production (UOP) method over the lives of the assets. The lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us. Estimated lives are based on historical experience, manufacturers estimates, engineering or appraisal estimates and future business plans. We review the depreciable lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment on a periodic basis, and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews. At the end of 2006, we completed a comprehensive review of the depreciable lives of our production facilities and related assets, as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our UOP depreciation expense. As a result of this review, we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities from ten years to fifteen years. Separately, we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain UOP assets at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex and all UOP assets at our Plant City, Florida phosphate complex. As a result of these changes, depreciation expense was reduced by $11.5 million for 2007. Of the $11.5 million reduction in depreciation expense, $10.1 million relates to our nitrogen production assets and $1.4 million relates to our phosphate production assets. Included in the $10.1 million decrease in depreciation for nitrogen assets was $1.2 million relating to CFL, a joint venture of which we own 66%. The effect of this change in estimate for 2007 was an increase in earnings before income taxes of $10.3 million, an increase in net earnings of $6.7 million, and an increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.12. Of the $10.3 million reduction in depreciation expense, approximately $9.0 million related to our nitrogen production assets and $1.3 million related to our phosphate production assets. Inventory Valuation We review our inventory balances at least quarterly, and more frequently if required by market conditions, to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value. This review process incorporates current industry and customer specific trends, current operational plans for the inventory and historical price activity of inventory. If the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value, we would immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly. Upon inventory liquidation, if the actual sales price ultimately realized were less than our initial estimate of net realizable value, additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Remediation Liabilities Costs associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the Bartow and Plant City, Florida phosphate fertilizer complexes and costs associated with land reclamation activities at our Hardee, Florida phosphate rock mine are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. If the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated, asset retirement obligations (AROs) are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service. Costs associated with the cessation of operations at all of our facilities are accounted for in accordance with FIN No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. This interpretation requires us to recognize a liability for AROs for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. The obligations related to closure, reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at 61 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded. The liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense. Accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time. The asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life. The aggregate carrying value of all of our AROs was $89.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and $87.1 million as of December 31, 2006. The increase in the aggregate carrying value of these AROs is due to recording changes in estimates and normal accretion expense on existing AROs as previously discussed. Environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies. Estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, site specific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations. In reporting environmental liabilities, no offset is made for potential recoveries. All liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur. In accordance with GAAP, environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits. Changes in laws, regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements. The amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled $8.1 million as of December 31, 2007 and $9.4 million as of December 31, 2006. The actual amounts to be spent on AROs and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments and cost inflation, as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations. The estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Recoverability of Long Lived Assets We review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment on a regular basis in accordance with SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. If impairment of an asset has occurred, an impairment charge is recognized immediately. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, prices, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The recoverability of the values associated with our long lived assets is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income, of an appropriate character, in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and non operating net, respectively. Upon the completion of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes. On the date of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. had a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) generated from business conducted with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners. These net operating loss carryforwards totaled $250 million, with expirations ranging from 2021 through 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended 62 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. December 31, 2005 includes a charge of $99.9 million to establish a 100% valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these NOLs. The valuation allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized since CF Industries, Inc. is no longer a cooperative for federal income tax purposes. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a net operating loss agreement with CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners (NOL Agreement) relating to the future treatment of the pre IPO NOLs. Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that CF Industries, Inc.s net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the IPO, we will pay to CF Industries, Inc.s pre IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved. Pension Assets and Liabilities Pension assets and liabilities are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Our projected benefit obligation (PBO) related to our qualified pension plans was $245.4 million at December 31, 2007, which was $15.6 million higher than pension plan assets. The December 31, 2007 PBO was computed based on a 6.00% discount rate, which was based on yields for high quality corporate bonds (Aa rated or better) with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension liability. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. If the discount rate used to compute the PBO was lower by 50 basis points, our PBO would have been $17.1 million higher than the amount previously discussed. Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute the PBO was higher by 50 basis points, our PBO would have been $15.4 million lower. The discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2007 was 5.70%. If the discount rate used to compute 2007 pension expense was lower by 50 basis points, the expense would have been approximately $1.8 million higher than the amount calculated. Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute 2007 pension expense was higher by 50 basis points, the expense would have been approximately $1.6 million lower than the amount calculated. Our net benefit obligation, after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate. The 7.2% expected long term rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non equity investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding periods. If the expected long term rate of return on assets was higher by 50 basis points, pension expense for 2007 would have been $1.0 million lower. Conversely, if the expected long term rate of return on assets was lower by 50 basis points, pension expense for 2007 would have been $1.0 million higher. See Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of our pension plans. Retiree Medical Benefits Retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions, including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense. Stock Based Compensation Costs associated with stock based compensation are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all stock based awards over the service period. The fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black 63 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Scholes option valuation model. Key assumptions used in the Black Scholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected life. The expected volatility used to value most of the stock options granted in 2007 was 36%. If the expected volatility was 2% higher or lower, the fair value of the stock options would have been 3.5% higher or lower, respectively. The expected life of most of the stock options granted in 2007 was 5.7 years. If the expected life was 0.5 years higher or lower, the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 4.5% higher or lower, respectively. The basis for determining these assumptions may change as more experience is obtained with our own historical stock prices and employees option exercise behavior. We accrue the cost of stock based awards on the straight line method over the applicable vesting period. As a result, total compensation cost recognized for 2007 on a pre tax basis was $9.7 million. As of December 31, 2007, on a pre tax basis there was approximately $8.0 million and $2.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 and 1.6 years, respectively. See Note 27 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of stock based compensation. Consolidation We consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity, determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf, determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity, and determining whether we absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns. We use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions. We eliminate from financial results all significant intercompany transactions. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Following are summaries of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are either currently applicable or may become applicable to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in the future. FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS or Statement) No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The adoption of FIN No. 48 in the first quarter of 2007 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not require any new fair value 64 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. measurements; however, for some entities, the application of this Statement may change current practice. This Statement is effective for us beginning January 1, 2008. Although the adoption of this Statement will impact our disclosures, we do not expect it to have a material impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This Statement permits entities to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and record unrealized gains and losses in earnings. It also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements for items reported at fair value in the financial statements. This Statement is effective for us beginning January 1, 2008. We do not anticipate that we will apply the fair value measurement option. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 11 Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards. This EITF Issue clarifies how a company should recognize the income tax benefit received on dividends that are paid to employees holding equity classified nonvested shares, equity classified nonvested share units, or equity classified outstanding share options that are charged to retained earnings under SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment. This EITF Issue is effective for income tax benefits that result from dividends on equity classified share based payment awards that are declared by the Company beginning January 1, 2008. We do not expect that the adoption of this EITF Issue will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement requires an entity to clearly identify and report ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity but separate from the parents equity. The Statement also requires that the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be identified and presented on the face of the consolidated income statement; that changes in a parents ownership interest be accounted for as equity transactions; and that when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary and the gain or loss on the deconsolidation be measured at fair value. This Statement is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this new standard and have not yet determined the impact of adopting at this time. SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007) Business Combinations. This Statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair values as of the acquisition date. This Statement also requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred, restructuring costs to be expensed in the period subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date to impact tax expense. This Statement also requires the acquirer in an acquisition implemented in stages to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values. This Statement is effective for us for business combinations with an acquisition date after December 31, 2008. EITF Issue No. 07 01 Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements. This Issue defines a collaborative arrangement as a contractual agreement that involves a joint operating activity. These arrangements involve two (or more) parties who are both active participants in the activity and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. This Issue addresses the income statement presentation and classification for these activities and payments between the participants, as well as disclosures related to these arrangements. This Issue is effective for our collaborative arrangements existing on or after January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this new standard and have not yet determined the impact of adopting at this time. 65 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Forward Pricing Program (FPP) In mid 2003, we instituted a program that has reduced the risk inherent in the relationship between volatile fertilizer prices and natural gas costs for product that we manufacture. Our basic concept (when applied to nitrogen fertilizers) is to fix the price of our principal raw material, natural gas, coincident with the establishment of the fertilizer sales price, which often occurs months in advance of shipment. Customer advances, which typically represent a significant portion of the contracts sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the FPP are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped, which can take up to several months. As is the case for all of our sales transactions, revenue is recognized when title transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers. We lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative instruments, or, in some cases, with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases. During 2007, we sold approximately 4.6 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer, representing approximately 66% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume, and approximately 835,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, representing approximately 42% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume, under the FPP. In 2006, we sold approximately 2.7 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer, representing approximately 44% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume, and approximately 294,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, representing approximately 14% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume, under the FPP. During 2005, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume, and approximately 718,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer, representing approximately 36% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume, under the FPP. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had approximately 3.0 million tons of product and 1.7 million tons of product, respectively, committed to be sold under this program. Most of these amounts were scheduled to ship within 150 days of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products and a substantial portion of the cost to manufacture the nitrogen products under our FPP, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Participation in the FPP is affected by market conditions and our customers expectations. There can be no assurance that we will transact the same percentage of our business under the FPP in the future. Should the level of participation decrease, there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods. Discussion of Seasonality Impacts on Operations Our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and or our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns. 66  CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Interest Rate Fluctuations Borrowings under variable rate notes payable bear a current market rate of interest such that we are subject to interest rate risk on these items. The credit facility bears a similar risk, but as of December 31, 2007, there were no borrowings under this facility. As of December 31, 2007, a 100 basis point change in interest rates on our floating rate loans, which totaled $4.9 million, would result in a $49,000 change in pretax earnings on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2007, we had short term investments of $494.5 million consisting primarily of available for sale tax exempt auction rate securities that we intend to hold over periods ranging from one to twelve months. A 100 basis point change in the average rate of interest earned on these short term investments would result in a $4.9 million change in pre tax income on an annual basis. Our advances to unconsolidated affiliates consisted of floating rate subordinated debt owed to us by Keytrade totaling 15.0 million Swiss Francs (CHF) ($13.2 million) as of December 31, 2007. A 100 basis point change in interest rates on this subordinated debt would result in $132,000 change in pretax earnings on an annual basis assuming the exchange rate at December 31, 2007. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar as a result of our 66% economic interest and our 49% common equity interest in CFL. At the present time, we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to CFL. We are also exposed to changes in the value of the Swiss Franc as we have CHF 15.0 million of subordinated debt due from Keytrade as of December 31, 2007. A $0.10 change in the U.S. dollar value of the CHF would result in a $1.5 million change in pretax earnings on an annual basis. Commodity Prices Our net sales, cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to the nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer sales not made under the forward pricing program are sensitive to changes in nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials. A $1.00 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia, urea and UAN (28%) by approximately $33, $22 and $12, respectively. We use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen fertilizer products. Because natural gas prices are volatile, our Natural Gas Acquisition Policy includes the objective of providing protection against significant adverse natural gas price movements. We manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years. The derivative instruments currently used are swaps. These contracts reference primarily NYMEX futures contract prices, which represent fair value at any given time. The related contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. As of December 31, 2007, we had hedged approximately 39.1 million MMBtus of natural gas, all of which related to sales that had been contracted to be sold through our forward pricing program as of December 31, 2007. An overall $1.00 per MMBtu change in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change the pre tax unrealized mark to market gain/loss on these derivative positions by $39.1 million. We also establish derivative 67 CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. positions in natural gas that are unrelated to forward pricing program contracts if we consider it appropriate to do so. Through the third quarter of 2005, we applied cash flow hedge accounting as defined in SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities, wherein we recorded the derivatives as assets and liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet with an offset in other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss of an effective cash flow hedge was deferred in other comprehensive income (loss) until the cost of the hedged gas was recognized in cost of sales. Ineffective hedge gains and losses were recorded directly in cost of sales. Instability in the natural gas market during the last half of 2005 and our resulting decision to supply FPP orders from sources other than production reduced our ability to predict future natural gas requirements. Consequently, we ceased classifying derivatives as cash flow hedges beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005. As a result, while the derivatives are still carried at their fair value on the balance sheet, unrealized gains or losses related to the derivatives are recognized in operations as they occur. We purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of DAP and MAP. We attempt to include any price fluctuations related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products, but there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered. We enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices. A $10 per related ton change in the cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change DAP production cost by $2.10 per ton and $3.80 per ton, respectively. We also purchase ammonia, urea and UAN to augment or replace production at our facilities. 68  CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
