The following is an outline of the discussion and analysis included herein: Overview of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Our Company Financial Executive Summary Company History Key Industry Factors Factors Affecting Our Results Results of Consolidated Operations Operating Results by Business Segment Liquidity and Capital Resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Recent Accounting Pronouncements Forward Pricing Program (FPP) Discussion of Seasonality Impacts on Operations Overview of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Our Company We are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in North America. Our operations are organized into two business segments: the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment. Our principal products in the nitrogen segment are ammonia, urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution, or UAN. Our principal products in the phosphate segment are diammonium phosphate, or DAP, monoammonium phosphate, or MAP and granular muriate of potash, or potash. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2007, the most recent period for which such information is available, we supplied approximately 22% of the nitrogen and approximately 14% of the phosphate used in agricultural fertilizer applications in the United States, according to the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials. Our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated in the Midwestern U.S. grain producing states. Our principal customers are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors. Our principal assets include: the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America (Donaldsonville, Louisiana); a 66% economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada (which we operate in Medicine Hat, Alberta, through Canadian Fertilizers Limited, or CFL, a consolidated variable interest entity); one of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the United States (Plant City, Florida); 33 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. the most recently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation plant in the United States (Hardee County, Florida); an extensive system of terminals, warehouses and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States; and a 50% interest in KEYTRADE AG (Keytrade), a global fertilizer trading company headquartered near Zurich, Switzerland, which we account for as an equity method investment. Financial Executive Summary We reported net earnings of $684.6 million in 2008 compared to net earnings of $372.7 million in 2007, reflecting the impact of a strong pricing environment for our products. Our results for 2008 included a net pre tax unrealized mark to market loss of $63.8 million ($41.1 million after tax) on natural gas derivatives in our nitrogen segment and a $57.0 million ($36.7 million after tax) non cash inventory valuation charge in our phosphate segment. Net earnings of $372.7 million in 2007 included a net $17.0 million pre tax unrealized mark to market gain ($11.0 million after tax) on natural gas derivatives. Our gross margin increased by $552.7 million to $1,222.7 million in 2008 compared to $670.0 million in 2007. The increase in gross margin resulted mainly from higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices, partially offset by higher phosphate raw material costs, higher realized natural gas costs, increased purchased product costs, as well as unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives and valuation charges to phosphate and potash inventories. Our net sales increased 42% to $3.9 billion in 2008 compared to $2.8 billion in 2007. The increase reflected higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices offset slightly by lower nitrogen and phosphate sales volume. Total sales volume was 7.9 million tons in 2008 as compared to 8.9 million tons in 2007. Cash flow from operations decreased $51.5 million to $638.6 million in 2008, due primarily to cash used to support an increase in inventory that more than offset improved operating results. As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of $625.0 million, $177.8 million of illiquid investments in auction rate securities and a $347.8 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our FPP. As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents of $366.5 million, short term investments (mainly auction rate securities) of $494.5 million and customer advances of $305.8 million, respectively. We paid cash dividends of $22.0 million in 2008, an increase of $17.5 million from 2007, due to an increase of the quarterly dividend to $0.10 per common share from $0.02 per common share. On August 30, 2008 we implemented an orderly shutdown of our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex in anticipation of Hurricane Gustav, which struck the region on September 1, 2008. Although the Donaldsonville complex suffered only minor damage, the hurricane caused substantial damage to the electrical power distribution system in the region causing the complex to be without power until September 8, 2008. Production units were brought back online progressively and all production units were operational by September 24, 2008. Total lost production as a result of the storm consisted of about 40,000 shippable tons of ammonia, 100,000 tons of urea and 31,000 tons of UAN (28%) solution. This production disruption did not impact our ability to meet our sales commitments. The cost of repairs and incremental expenses was approximately $5 million, which was charged to cost of sales mainly in the third quarter. 34 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Additionally, approximately $7 million of fixed overhead costs at the Donaldsonville complex were charged directly to cost of sales due to the shutdown. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased and retired 8.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $500 million (at an average price of $58.96 per share) under a program authorized by our Board of Directors. Company History We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power. During the 1960s, we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1 billion in each of these decades. Through the end of 2002, we operated as a traditional supply cooperative. Our focus was on providing our pre IPO owners with an assured supply of fertilizer. Typically, over 80% of our annual sales volume was to our pre IPO owners. Though important, financial performance was subordinate to our mandated supply objective. In 2002, we reassessed our corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial performance, rather than assured supply to our pre IPO owners, as our principal objective. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace. Under the new business model, we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on financial performance. One result of this approach was a substantial shift in our customer mix. By 2008, our sales to customers other than our pre IPO owners and Viterra Inc. (formerly Westco), our joint venture partner in CFL, reached approximately 53% of our total sales volume for the year, which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002. CF Holdings was formed as a Delaware corporation in April 2005 to hold the existing businesses of CF Industries, Inc. On August 16, 2005, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of common stock. We sold approximately 47.4 million shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately $715.4 million. We did not retain any of the proceeds from our IPO. In connection with our IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction in which CF Industries, Inc. ceased to be a cooperative and became our wholly owned subsidiary. In the reorganization transaction, all of the equity interests in CF Industries, Inc. were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the IPO and approximately 7.6 million shares of our common stock. Significant Items 2008 During 2008, the nitrogen and phosphate segments experienced record high selling prices due to favorable supply and demand balances until the fourth quarter when sharply reduced fertilizer demand significantly impacted nitrogen and phosphate selling prices. Factors leading to reduced demand included poor weather in North America, declining crop prices and reduced credit availability. Consolidated net sales increased by $1.1 billion, or 42%, to $3.9 billion in 2008, with increases due to higher average selling prices in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments. Gross margin increased by $552.7 million in 2008. Our 2008 gross margin included a $63.8 million pre tax unrealized mark to market loss on natural gas derivatives. In 2008, we began staging purchased potash fertilizer in our distribution network and expect to commence sales in the spring season of 2009. The potash results 35 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. are included in the phosphate segment. During the fourth quarter, we recorded a $57.0 million pre tax ($36.7 million after tax) non cash charge to write down our phosphate ($30.3 million) and potash ($26.7 million) inventories as the carrying cost exceeded the estimated net realizable values. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased and retired 8.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $500 million (at an average price of $58.96 per share) under a program authorized by our Board of Directors. 2007 Both the nitrogen and phosphate segments in 2007 were favorably impacted by improved demand and pricing as a robust agricultural economy characterized by strong domestic and international grain markets produced high global demand for fertilizer. Increasing demand pushed average selling prices higher as the year progressed. Consolidated net sales increased by $723.8 million, or 36%, to $2.8 billion in 2007, with increases in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments. Gross margin increased by $522.8 million in 2007. Our 2007 gross margin included a $17.0 million pre tax unrealized mark to market gain on natural gas derivatives. Keytrade is a reseller of fertilizer products that it purchases from various manufacturers around the world and resells in approximately 50 countries through a network of seven offices. During 2007, we purchased a 50% voting interest in Keytrade for $25.9 million. Under this arrangement, we utilize Keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizer products from North America, and Keytrade is our exclusive importer of UAN products into North America. We also provided $13.7 million in a combination of subordinated financing for Keytrade under notes that will mature in September 2017 and preferred stock. We report Keytrade as an equity method investment. We periodically review the depreciable lives assigned to our production facilities and related assets, as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our units of production (UOP) depreciation expense, and we change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed such a review and, as a result, we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities from ten years to fifteen years. Separately, we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain UOP assets at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex and all UOP assets at our Plant City, Florida phosphate complex. The effect of this change in estimate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 was an increase in earnings before income taxes of $10.3 million, an increase in net earnings of $6.7 million, and an increase in diluted earnings per share of $0.12. 2006 The domestic nitrogen segment in 2006 was affected by adverse conditions early in the year due to the remaining impacts from the 2005 hurricane season and its impact on natural gas pricing due to damage experienced by Gulf of Mexico gas producers. Later in the year, natural gas prices fell, and a tight international market for fertilizer products and an expectation of a stronger planting season in early 2007 led to a stabilization in overall pricing. Results for our phosphate business in 2006 were impacted favorably by increased domestic demand and stable international conditions. Consolidated net sales increased $65.0 million, or 3.3%, in 2006 to $2.0 billion, with increases in both the nitrogen and phosphate segments. Gross margin declined by $62.0 million, or 30%, to $147.2 million. Our 2006 gross margin was impacted by a $30.7 million pre tax charge for unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $21.6 million for adjustments to asset retirement obligations (AROs) and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex. Late in 2006, management committed to a plan to relocate its corporate office to Deerfield, Illinois. The move was completed in the first quarter of 2007. 36 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Key Industry Factors We operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our products are globally traded commodities and, as a result, we compete principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality. Moreover, our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below. Global Supply & Demand Historically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, changes in dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short term fertilizer demand depends on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption, federal regulations, including requirements mandating increased use of bio fuels and farm sector income. Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying/selling patterns of key consuming/exporting countries such as China, India or Brazil often play a major role in shaping near term market fundamentals. The economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs, government policies and global trade. Natural Gas Prices Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, urea and UAN. Because all of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada, the price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Expenditures on natural gas comprised approximately 56% of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales in 2008 and a higher percentage of cash production costs (total production costs less depreciation and amortization). Farmers Economics The demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. Fertilizer demand has increased in response to increased corn acreage planted to support the growing ethanol industry. Global Trade in Fertilizer In addition to the relationship between global supply and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other matters. Changes in currency values alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world. Imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen based fertilizers located in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela are major exporters to North America. 37 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. The domestic phosphate industry is tied to the global market through its position as the worlds largest exporter of DAP/MAP. Consequently, phosphate prices and demand for U.S. DAP/MAP are subject to considerable volatility and dependent on a wide variety of factors impacting the world market, including fertilizer and or trade policies of foreign governments, changes in ocean bound freight rates and international currency fluctuations. Political and Social Government Policies The political and social policies of governments around the world can result in the restriction of imports, the subsidization of domestic producers and or the subsidization of exports. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these political and social objectives. Factors Affecting Our Results Net Sales. Our net sales are derived from the sale of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize. The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers. Cost of Sales. Our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, product purchases and distribution costs. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, maintenance, direct labor and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers. In 2003, we instituted a margin risk management approach utilizing our forward pricing program (FPP), which allows us to manage some of the risks created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs. Through our FPP, we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. As our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us, we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative instruments. See "Forward Pricing Program" later in this discussion and analysis. As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our FPP, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and other payroll related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees. Our selling, general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of the consummation of our IPO. These expenses include additional legal and corporate governance expenses, stock based awards, salary and payroll related costs for additional accounting staff, director compensation, exchange listing fees, transfer agent and stockholder related fees and increased premiums for director and officer liability insurance coverage. Other Operating Net. Other operating net includes the costs associated with our closed Bartow phosphate facility and other costs that do not relate directly to our central operations. Bartow facility 38 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. costs include provisions for phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond closure costs, water treatment costs and costs associated with the cessation of operations. The term "other costs" refers to amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business, litigation expenses, gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets and impairment charges for goodwill. Interest Expense. Our interest expense includes the interest on our long term debt and notes payable, annual fees on our senior secured revolving credit facility and amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements. Interest Income. Our interest income represents amounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents, investments and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. Minority Interest. Amounts reported as minority interest represent the 34% minority interest in the net operating results of CFL, our consolidated Canadian joint venture. We own 49% of the voting common stock of CFL and 66% of CFLs non voting preferred stock. Two of our pre IPO owners own 17% of CFLs voting common stock, including GROWMARK which owns 9%. The remaining 34% of the voting common stock and non voting preferred stock of CFL is held by Viterra. We designate four members of CFLs nine member board of directors, which also has one member designated by each of our two pre IPO owners that own an interest in CFL and three members designated by Viterra. We operate the Medicine Hat facility and purchase approximately 66% of the facilitys ammonia and urea production, pursuant to a management agreement and a product purchase agreement. Both the management agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either us or CFL upon a twelve month notice. Viterra has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the remaining 34% of the facilitys ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement. To the extent that Viterra does not purchase its 34% of the facilitys production, we are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts. Since 1995, however, Viterra has purchased at least 34% of the facilitys production each year. Under the product purchase agreements, both we and Viterra pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases. However, the product purchase agreements also provide that CFL will distribute its net earnings to us and Viterra annually based on the respective quantities of product purchased from CFL. The distributions to Viterra are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, as we consider these payments to be similar to dividends. Our product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to CFL in the event that CFL is unable to meet its debts as they become due. The amount of each advance would be related to the amount of product we purchase, or at least 66% of the deficiency, and would be more in any year in which we purchased more than 66% of Medicine Hats production. A similar obligation also exists for Viterra. We and Viterra currently manage CFL such that each party is responsible for its share of CFLs fixed costs and that CFLs production volume meets the parties combined requirements. The management agreement, the product purchase agreements and any other agreements related to CFL are subject to change with the consent of both parties. Income Taxes. Our income tax provision includes all currently payable and deferred United States and Canadian income tax expense applicable to our ongoing operations. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income, of an appropriate character, in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a 39 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. deferred tax asset will not be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and non operating net, respectively. In connection with our initial public offering (IPO) in August 2005, CF Industries, Inc. (CFI) ceased to be non exempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes, and we entered into a net operating loss agreement (NOL Agreement) with CFIs pre IPO owners relating to the future utilization of the pre IPO net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that the NOLs can be utilized to offset applicable post IPO taxable income, we will pay the pre IPO owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved. CFL operates as a cooperative for Canadian income tax purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its customers, including CF Industries, Inc. For Canadian income tax purposes, CFL is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it distributes to its customers, provided that certain requirements are met. As a result, CFL records no income tax provision. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Net of Taxes. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of taxes represents our share of the net earnings of the entities in which we have an ownership interest and exert significant operational and financial influence. Income taxes related to these investments, if any, are reflected in this line. The amounts recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of taxes in 2008 and 2007 relate to our investment in Keytrade. 40  Table of Contents  CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Later in the year the nitrogen segment was adversely impacted by poor weather conditions during the fall application period and rapidly declining demand due to a combination of declining grain prices and the impact of the world financial crisis. Operating results in our phosphate segment also improved over 2007 due to record high selling prices and tight international supply/demand conditions. Our phosphate segment was also adversely affected later in 2008 by a deteriorating international market as well as reduced domestic demand. Our total gross margin increased by $552.7 million to $1,222.7 million for 2008, from a gross margin of $670.0 million for 2007. The increase resulted mainly from higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs, increased purchased product costs, unrealized mark to market losses on natural gas derivatives, and, later in the year, inventory valuation charges in the phosphate segment. Net earnings of $684.6 million for 2008 included a net pre tax unrealized mark to market loss of $63.8 million ($41.1 million after tax) on natural gas derivatives as well as a $57.0 million ($36.7 million after tax) non cash inventory valuation charge in our phosphate segment. Net earnings of $372.7 million for 2007 included a pre tax unrealized mark to market gain of $17.0 million ($11.0 million after tax) on natural gas derivatives. 41 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Net Sales Our net sales were $3.9 billion for 2008, or $1.1 billion higher than net sales for 2007. Higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices were partially offset by lower sales volume. Average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices for 2008 were 44% and 108% higher, respectively, than the prices for similar products in 2007, reflecting overall tight market conditions and increased international demand. Our total sales volume decreased 11% to 7.9 million tons for 2008 versus 8.9 million tons for 2007. Nitrogen sales volume in 2008 decreased 797,000 tons, or 12%, to 6.1 million tons for 2008 compared to 6.9 million tons in 2007 due mainly to poor weather conditions during the spring and fall application periods and the decision to reduce sales of low margin purchased UAN. Our total level of phosphate sales volume was 1.8 million tons for 2008, compared to 2.0 million tons sold in 2007. The decrease in 2008 was caused by reduced domestic demand due to customers deferring phosphate purchases because of ample downstream inventories and uncertain farm economics. Cost of Sales Total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged $296 per ton for 2008 compared to $230 per ton in 2007, an increase of 29%. This increase was due largely to higher purchased product costs, higher realized natural gas costs and the effect of unrealized mark to market adjustments on natural gas derivatives. The phosphate segment cost of sales averaged $491 per ton for 2008, compared to $247 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 99%. This increase was due mainly to higher sulfur and ammonia costs and an inventory valuation charge. During 2008, we sold approximately 5.6 million tons of fertilizer under our FPP, representing approximately 71% of our total sales volume for the period. In 2007, we sold approximately 5.4 million tons of fertilizer under this program, representing approximately 60% of our total sales volume for the period. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4% to $68.0 million in 2008 compared to $65.2 million in 2007. This increase was related primarily to an increase in consulting fees, legal fees, corporate office expenses related to maintaining our previous corporate headquarters and expenses related to performance based incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by lower long term stock based compensation, other compensation related costs and higher acquisition expenses in the prior period related to our 2007 investment in Keytrade. Other Operating Net Other operating net increased $1.3 million to $4.5 million in 2008 from $3.2 million in 2007. This increase includes a $4.6 million charge in 2008 primarily for asset retirement obligations (AROs) to recognize revised cost estimates to close the cooling pond and phosphogypsum stack system at our closed Bartow, Florida facility. Both 2008 and 2007 include gains that were recognized upon the sale of certain closed facilities or property and equipment. During 2008, we recorded a gain on the sale of both the excess land at our previous headquarters in Long Grove, Illinois and certain property and equipment at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex. In 2007, we recognized a gain when we sold a warehouse and a parcel of land at Bartow. For a detailed explanation of the accounting for AROs at Bartow, please refer to Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 42 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Interest Net Interest net increased $1.8 million to $24.5 million of net interest income in 2008 from $22.7 million of net interest income in 2007. Interest income increased $1.7 million to $26.1 million in 2008 from $24.4 million in 2007 due to higher average balances of invested cash and higher average rates of return on securities held. Interest expense decreased $0.1 million to $1.6 million in 2008 from $1.7 million in 2007. Minority Interest Amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFLs common and preferred shares. The increase in 2008 was due to strong CFL operating results. The improvement in CFL operating results reflects higher sales prices for nitrogen fertilizers produced in Canada. Income Taxes Our income tax provision for 2008 was $378.1 million, and represents an effective tax rate of 35.7%. This compared with a tax provision of $199.5 million on pre tax earnings for 2007, and an effective tax rate of 34.9%. The 2008 increase in the effective tax rate results principally from lower tax exempt interest income earned on our investments in 2008. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Net of Taxes Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of taxes for 2008 and 2007 consists of our share of the operating results of Keytrade. Diluted Net Earnings Per Share and Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted net earnings per share increased to $12.15 per share for 2008 from $6.57 per share for 2007 due primarily to the increase in net earnings. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 56.4 million for 2008 approximated the prior year level. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Consolidated Operating Results Increased domestic demand, coupled with tight domestic and international markets, drove strong financial performance in the nitrogen segment in 2007, as compared to the prior year. Demand increased due to an increase in corn acreage planted, higher spring season application rates, a strong fall application season driven by favorable weather conditions and expectations of a strong spring season in 2008. Operating results in our phosphate segment improved due to tight domestic supply/demand conditions and strong worldwide demand. Our total gross margin increased by $522.8 million to $670.0 million for 2007, from a gross margin of $147.2 million for 2006. The increase was due largely to higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices, unrealized mark to market adjustments on natural gas derivatives, and higher nitrogen sales volume, partially offset by higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs. Net earnings of $372.7 million for 2007 included a net pre tax unrealized mark to market gain of $17.0 million ($11.0 million after tax) on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $1.0 million ($0.7 million after tax) for changes in estimates to our asset retirement obligations (AROs) and demolition costs. Net earnings of $33.3 million for 2006 included a pre tax charge of $30.7 million ($18.7 million after tax) for unrealized mark to market losses 43 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. on natural gas derivatives and a pre tax charge of $21.6 million ($13.1 million after tax) for adjustments to AROs and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex. Net Sales Our net sales were $2.8 billion for 2007, or $723.8 million higher than net sales for 2006, due largely to higher average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices and an increase in nitrogen sales volume. Our total sales volume increased 6% to 8.9 million tons for 2007 versus 8.4 million tons for 2006. Nitrogen sales volume in 2007 increased 628,000 tons, or 10%, to 6.9 million tons for 2007 compared to 6.3 million tons in 2006 due to increased domestic demand and our customers anticipation of a strong spring season in 2008. Our total level of phosphate sales was 2.0 million tons for 2007, slightly below the 2.1 million tons sold in 2006. Average nitrogen and phosphate selling prices for 2007 were 22% and 46% higher, respectively, than the prices for similar products in 2006 reflecting overall tight market conditions and increased domestic demand. Cost of Sales Total cost of sales of the nitrogen segment averaged $230 per ton for 2007 compared to $226 per ton in 2006, an increase of 2%. This increase was due largely to higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs, partially offset by unrealized mark to market adjustments on natural gas derivatives. Phosphate cost of sales averaged $247 per ton for 2007, compared to $221 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 12%. This increase was due mainly to higher costs for finished products we purchased to supplement our production and higher phosphate rock costs. During 2007, we sold approximately 5.4 million tons of fertilizer under our FPP, representing approximately 60% of our total sales volume for the period. In 2006, we sold approximately 3.0 million tons of fertilizer under this program, representing approximately 36% of our total sales volume for the period. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20% to $65.2 million in 2007 compared to $54.5 million in 2006. The year over year increase in expense for 2007 resulted largely from increased expenses related to performance based short term management incentive compensation expenses related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to Deerfield, Illinois, increased compensation costs associated with our long term stock based compensation, expenses related to our Keytrade investment and certain software implementation costs. Other Operating Net Other operating net decreased to $3.2 million in 2007 from $21.4 million in 2006. We recorded a $3.8 million gain on the third quarter 2007 sale of a parcel of land and a warehouse at our closed Bartow, Florida, facility. In conjunction with that sale we reduced the related AROs by $1.0 million to reflect obligations previously recognized for which we are now no longer responsible. On an annual basis, we review all aspects of the closed Bartow complex with respect to AROs and other plant site closure related activities. As a result of our year end 2007 review, as well as other reviews performed during the year, we recorded net upward adjustments of $0.8 million to other Bartow AROs during 2007. This upward adjustment excluded the $1.0 million reduction due to the sale of the land and warehouse previously mentioned. In 2006, we recorded a charge of $14.9 million, primarily in the fourth quarter, to reflect revised estimates for water treatment and phosphogypsum stack system closure costs and plant closure costs. These Bartow related charges pertained to additional water 44 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. treatment costs to accommodate closure of the cooling pond, additional phosphogypsum stack system closure costs associated with the cooling channel as well as higher costs related to site closure activities, storm water management and closure of the waste water treatment system. We also recorded a $3.3 million charge, again primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006, for additional planned demolition activities at Bartow. For a detailed explanation of the accounting for AROs at Bartow, please refer to Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Interest Net Interest net increased to $22.7 million of net interest income in 2007 from $9.6 million of net interest income in 2006. Interest income increased to $24.4 million in 2007 from $12.5 million in 2006 due to higher average balances of invested cash partially offset by lower average rates of return. The decrease in the average rates of return is due to substantially all of our short term investments for 2007 being in securities that are exempt from federal taxation. Interest expense decreased 41% to $1.7 million in 2007 from $2.9 million in 2006. This decrease was due primarily to $1.0 million of interest expense recorded in the second quarter of 2006 related to a Canadian income tax matter. Minority Interest Amounts reported as minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFLs common and preferred shares. The increase in 2007 was due to CFL operating results. The improvement in CFL operating results reflects stronger market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers produced in Canada. Income Taxes Our income tax provision for 2007 was $199.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 34.9%. This compared with a tax provision of $19.7 million on pre tax earnings for 2006, and an effective tax rate of 37.2%. The 2007 decrease in the effective tax rate results principally from the impact of an increase in the U.S. domestic production activities deduction and non taxable interest income earned on short term investments. Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates Net of Taxes Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of taxes for 2007 consists of our share of the operating results of Keytrade for the period we held the investment in 2007. The amounts recorded in 2007 include a deferred U.S. income tax provision of $0.7 million on our share of the earnings. Diluted Net Earnings Per Share and Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted net earnings per share increased to $6.57 per share for 2007 from $0.60 per share for 2006 due primarily to the increase in net earnings, partially offset by an increase in the diluted weighted average shares of outstanding common stock. The increase in the diluted weighted average shares of outstanding common stock in 2007 versus 2006 is due to the impact of stock option and restricted stock activity in 2007. 45  Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Operating Results by Business Segment Our business is organized and managed internally based on two segments, the nitrogen segment and the phosphate segment, which are differentiated primarily by their products, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate. Nitrogen Segment The following table presents summary operating data for our nitrogen segment: Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2008 v. 2007 2007 v. 2006 (in millions, except as noted) Net sales $ 2,591.1 $ 2,041.9 $ 1,521.9 $ 549.2 $ 520.0 Cost of sales 1,820.8 1,595.1 1,423.4 225.7 171.7 Gross margin $ 770.3 $ 446.8 $ 98.5 $ 323.5 $ 348.3 Gross margin percentage 29.7 % 21.9 % 6.5 % Tons of product sold (000s) 6,141 6,938 6,310 (797 ) 628 Sales volume by product (000s) Ammonia 1,079 1,434 1,226 (355 ) 208 Urea 2,617 2,701 2,619 (84 ) 82 UAN 2,405 2,754 2,420 (349 ) 334 Other nitrogen products 40 49 45 (9 ) 4 Average selling price per ton by product Ammonia $ 560 $ 388 $ 362 $ 172 $ 26 Urea 462 329 251 133 78 UAN 321 215 172 106 43 Cost of natural gas (per MMBtu)(1) Donaldsonville $ 9.42 $ 7.81 $ 7.20 $ 1.61 $ 0.61 Medicine Hat 7.74 6.24 6.56 1.50 (0.32 ) Average daily market price of natural gas (per MMBtu) Henry Hub (Louisiana) $ 8.82 $ 6.93 $ 6.74 $ 1.89 $ 0.19 AECO (Alberta) 7.76 5.99 5.76 1.77 0.23 Depreciation and amortization $ 57.3 $ 50.4 $ 59.2 $ 6.9 $ (8.8 ) Capital expenditures $ 74.2 $ 61.1 $ 26.0 $ 13.1 $ 35.1 Production volume by product (000s) Ammonia(2)(3) 3,249 3,289 3,158 (40 ) 131 Granular urea(2) 2,355 2,358 2,334 (3 ) 24 UAN (28%) 2,602 2,611 2,336 (9 ) 275 (1)Includes the cost of natural gas purchases and realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives.

Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net Sales. Nitrogen segment net sales increased 27% to $2.6 billion in 2008, compared to $2.0 billion in 2007, due to higher average selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume. The 44% increase in average ammonia selling prices for 2008, was driven primarily by both a tight domestic and international supply/demand balance and the expectation of strong Midwest fall application seasons. Strength in international markets, reflecting a reduction in Chinese exports and increased demand in Latin America contributed to the 40% increase in average urea selling prices. The 49% increase in average UAN selling prices for 2008 compared to 2007 reflected the impact of reduced import volume, below average producer inventory and stronger conditions in the international market through the third quarter of 2008. While spot selling prices across all nitrogen products decreased significantly later in the year, we benefited from the substantial volume we had booked under our FPP, with prices that were established earlier in the year. Nitrogen sales volume decreased 12% to 6.1 million tons in 2008 compared to 6.9 million tons in 2007. Ammonia volume, which decreased approximately 355,000 tons in 2008, was impacted by poor weather conditions during both the spring and the fall application periods. Also, overall nitrogen consumption, including ammonia, was affected during the spring by a reduction in planted corn acres, relative to the previous year. The 3% decrease in urea sales volumes resulted from relatively full downstream inventories late in the year. The 349,000 ton decrease in UAN sales volumes resulted primarily from our decision to reduce sales of low margin purchased UAN and a slowdown in demand stemming from high downstream inventories in the second half of the year caused by product carryover from weak spring product movement. Cost of Sales. Total cost of sales in the nitrogen segment increased 29% to $296 per ton for 2008, compared to $230 per ton for 2007, due largely to higher realized natural gas costs and higher purchased product costs in addition to unrealized mark to market adjustments on natural gas derivatives. The costs of finished products purchased for resale were approximately $104.0 million higher in 2008 than in 2007 due primarily to the overall increase in nitrogen prices. The overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our Donaldsonville facility and CFLs Medicine Hat facility, including realized gains and losses on derivatives, increased by 22% in 2008 versus the cost in 2007. Cold temperatures in the first quarter of 2008, along with strong crude oil prices throughout most of the first nine months of 2008, helped drive natural gas prices higher relative to the prior year. However, in the fourth quarter natural gas prices declined to levels consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007 due to declines in crude oil prices driven by the overall global economic slowdown. We report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur. We recognized a net $63.8 million unrealized mark to market loss in 2008 compared to a net $17.0 million unrealized mark to market gain in 2007. During 2008, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our FPP, representing approximately 74% of our nitrogen sales volume for the period. In 2007, we sold approximately 4.6 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 66% of our nitrogen sales volume for the period. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Sales. Nitrogen segment net sales increased 34% to $2.0 billion in 2007, compared to $1.5 billion in 2006, due to higher average selling prices as well as higher sales volume. The 7% increase in average ammonia selling prices for 2007, arising mainly in the fourth quarter, was driven primarily by tight supplies heading into the quarter and a strong fall application season. Higher average urea selling prices reflected continued strong domestic and international demand. The 25% increase in 47 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. average UAN selling prices for 2007 compared to 2006 reflected strong domestic demand and a tight supply/demand balance. Nitrogen sales volume increased 10% to 6.9 million tons in 2007 compared to 6.3 million tons in 2006. The increase was due to the impact of an increase in corn acres planted, higher fertilizer application rates in the spring, as well as a strong fall ammonia application season and demand in anticipation of a strong spring 2008 planting season. The increase in corn acreage was driven by greater demand by ethanol producers, low corn inventories and continued strong demand for feed. Cost of Sales. Total cost of sales in our nitrogen segment averaged $230 per ton for 2007, compared to $226 per ton for 2006, an increase of 2%, largely due to higher purchased product costs and higher realized natural gas costs, partially offset by unrealized mark to market adjustments on natural gas derivatives. The costs of finished fertilizer products purchased for resale were approximately $57.6 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 due to an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products as well as the overall increase in nitrogen prices, both factors occurring mainly during the last six months of 2007. The overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied to our Donaldsonville facility and CFLs Medicine Hat facility, including realized gains and losses on derivatives, increased by 4% in 2007 versus the cost in 2006. The increase in realized gas costs was due mainly to greater net realized losses on our natural gas derivatives. We report our natural gas derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur. We recognized a net $17.0 million unrealized mark to market gain in 2007 compared to a net $30.7 million unrealized mark to market loss in 2006. During 2007, we sold approximately 4.6 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our FPP, representing approximately 66% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2006, we sold approximately 2.7 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 44% of our nitrogen sales volume for the period. 48  Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

(2)P2O5 is the basic measure of the nutrient content in phosphate fertilizer products. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net Sales. Phosphate segment net sales increased 86% to $1,330.0 million for 2008 compared to $714.8 million in 2007, due primarily to higher average selling prices. Average phosphate selling prices during 2008 more than doubled compared to prices in 2007. The increase was driven by strong worldwide demand caused by tightening world crop balances, record grain and oilseed prices and a 49 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. run up in raw material prices. While spot phosphate selling prices weakened during the last quarter of 2008, we benefited from certain sales made through our FPP at prices agreed upon earlier in the year. Our phosphate sales volume decreased 10% to 1.8 million tons in 2008 compared to 2.0 million tons in 2007. Although export sales increased by 87,000 tons, domestic sales volumes dropped 19%. Most of this decline occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 as downstream retailer and distributor inventories were full and customers deferred phosphate purchases due to uncertain farm economics. Cost of Sales. Phosphate segment cost of sales averaged $491 per ton for 2008, almost double the $247 per ton in the prior year. This increase was due mainly to higher sulfur and ammonia costs and a $57.0 million non cash inventory valuation adjustment. Both sulfur and ammonia costs demonstrated significant volatility during the year. Average annual sulfur costs for 2008 were more than five times the costs for 2007 due to continued tightening in the international markets during the first half of the year, which carried over from the end of 2007. As the international markets began to loosen in the second half of the year, domestic supply was interrupted due to hurricanes in the gulf coast in the third quarter, but the sulfur market collapsed in the fourth quarter due to phosphate production curtailments worldwide. An 81% increase in ammonia costs reflected a strong international market until late in the year when demand for phosphate production decreased. In the second half of 2008, we began staging purchased potash fertilizer in our distribution network and expect to commence sales in the spring season of 2009. The potash results are included in the phosphate segment. During the fourth quarter, we recorded a $57.0 million non cash charge to write down our phosphate and potash inventories by $30.3 million and $26.7 million, respectively, as the carrying cost of the inventories exceeded the estimated net realizable values. During 2008, we sold approximately 1.1 million tons of phosphate fertilizer under our FPP, representing approximately 61% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2007, we sold approximately 835,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under this program, representing approximately 42% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net Sales. Phosphate segment net sales increased 40% to $714.8 million for 2007 compared to $511.0 million in 2006, due to higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volume. Average phosphate selling prices during 2007 increased by 46% compared to prices in 2006. The increase was driven by strong domestic demand and reduced domestic production volumes (relative to historic levels) leading to a tight domestic supply/demand balance. Our total level of phosphate sales of 2.0 million tons in 2007 decreased 5% compared to 2.1 million tons in 2006. Export sales of DAP and MAP declined by 206,000 tons primarily from reduced availability of product due to scheduled first quarter maintenance activity at our Plant City, Florida phosphate complex, along with supply being made available for second quarter domestic sales in anticipation of increased domestic demand. Effective November 30, 2007, we terminated our membership in PhosChem and we no longer utilize this sales association to export phosphate fertilizers. Keytrade has become our sole exporter of phosphate fertilizers. Cost of Sales. Phosphate cost of sales averaged $247 per ton for 2007 compared to $221 per ton for 2006. The 12% increase was due mainly to higher purchased product costs and higher phosphate rock costs, as well as higher sulfur costs. Purchased product costs were approximately $13.4 million higher in 2007 than in the same period of 2006, due primarily to an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by purchased products, mainly occurring during the second quarter of 2007. Higher per ton phosphate rock mining costs were due to fewer tons mined in 2007 as compared to 2006 resulting from unfavorable mining conditions as well as higher earthmoving costs for land management. Average annual sulfur costs increased by 10% for 2007 compared to 2006. The increase, mainly 50 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. occurring in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflected the impact of a strengthening domestic sulfur market fueled by strong demand and insufficient supply. We expect the domestic and international sulfur markets to remain tight in 2008 due to strong anticipated demand from phosphate fertilizer and metal producers. During 2007, we sold approximately 835,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under our FPP, representing approximately 42% of our phosphate sales volume for the period. In 2006, we sold approximately 294,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer under this program, representing approximately 14% of our phosphate sales volume for the period. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of cash is cash from operations, which includes customer advances. Our primary uses of cash are operating costs, working capital needs, capital expenditures and dividends. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices for our products, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonality factors inherent in the business. Under our short term investment policy, we invest our excess cash balances in several types of securities, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations, and money market funds. Securities issued by governmental agencies include those issued directly by the U.S. government, those issued by state, local or other governmental entities, and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities. Cash Balances As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of $625.0 million and a $347.8 million current liability attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our forward pricing program. As of December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents of $366.5 million, short term investments of $494.5 million and a $305.8 million current liability attributable to customer advances. Investments in Auction Rate Securities We hold investments in available for sale high grade tax exempt auction rate securities. Auction rate securities are primarily debt instruments with long term maturities for which interest rates are expected to be reset periodically through an auction process, which typically occurs every 7 to 35 days. As of December 31, 2008, our investments in auction rate securities were reported at their fair value of $177.8 million, after reflecting a $20.8 million unrealized holding loss against a par value of $198.6 million. These securities were all supported by student loans that were originated primarily under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. The underlying securities have stated maturities that range from less than one year to 39 years, with the majority of them being in the 20 to 30 year range and are guaranteed by entities affiliated with government entities. At December 31, 2007, our investments in auction rate securities totaled $494.5 million, comprised of securities supported by municipal bonds and securities supported by student loans. In February 2008, the market for auction rate securities began to show signs of illiquidity. Shortly thereafter, liquidity left the market and auctions began to fail. A failed auction occurs when there are insufficient bids for the number of instruments being offered. Upon a failed auction, the then holders of those instruments continue to hold them and each instrument begins to carry an interest rate based upon a certain predefined formula for that particular security. Subsequent to the market slowdown for these securities, $69.9 million of our auction rate securities had been either redeemed by the issuers or sold at par value in 2008, including all of our auction rate securities that were supported by municipal bonds. 51 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Because auctions have continued to fail, we no longer consider our auction rate securities to be liquid investments. We are not able to access these funds until such time as auctions for the securities succeed once again, buyers are found outside the auction process, and or the securities are redeemed by the issuers. In accordance with our policies, we review the underlying securities and assess the creditworthiness of these securities as part of our investment process. In each case, our reviews have continued to find these investments to be investment grade. Due to the illiquidity in the credit markets and the failed auctions that started in February 2008, market valuations are no longer observable and we have classified these investments as Level 3 securities (those measured using significant unobservable inputs) under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157 Fair Value Measurements. As disclosed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, SFAS No. 157 requires supplemental disclosures regarding assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These investments in auction rate securities represent approximately 82% of the group of assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. We completed a valuation of these investments at December 31, 2008. The valuation of these securities utilizes a mark to model approach that relies on discounted cash flows, market data and inputs derived from similar instruments. These models take into account, among other variables, base interest rates, credit spreads, downgrade risks, default/recovery risk, the estimated time required to work out the disruption in the traditional auction process and its effect on liquidity, and the effects of insurance and other credit enhancements. Based on this valuation, we reflected a $20.8 million pre tax unrealized holding loss against the historical cost basis of these investments at December 31, 2008. The unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income and the impact of the unrealized holding loss is included in the net $177.8 million investment balance in auction rate securities. At December 31, 2008, these investments have been classified as noncurrent on our consolidated balance sheet, based on market conditions and our judgment regarding the period of time that may elapse until the traditional auction process resumes, or other effective market trading mechanisms develop. The model we used to value our auction rate securities uses discounted cash flow calculations as one of the significant inputs to the ultimate determination of value. The base interest rates assumed for the required rates of return are key components of the calculation of discounted cash flows. If the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points lower, the resulting holding loss would have been approximately $10 million greater. We may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets or in the variables considered in our valuation model. We believe that ultimately we will recover the historical cost for these instruments as we presently intend to hold these securities until market liquidity returns either through resumption of the auction process or otherwise. We do not believe the current market liquidity issues regarding these securities present any operating liquidity issues for us. Our cash, cash equivalents, operating cash flow and credit available under our credit facility are adequate to fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Debt Notes payable, representing amounts owed by CFL to its minority interest holder with respect to advances, were $4.1 million as of December 31, 2008 and $4.9 million as of December 31, 2007. There were no outstanding borrowings under our $250 million credit facility as of December 31, 2008 or December 31, 2007. 52 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Our $250 million credit facility, as amended on September 7, 2005 and July 31, 2007, is scheduled to be available until July 31, 2012 and bears interest at a variable rate. This facility is secured by working capital, certain equipment and the Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex. Our investment in and advances to Keytrade have been pledged as security under our credit facility. The credit facility provides up to $250 million, subject to a borrowing base, for working capital and general corporate purposes, including up to $50 million for the issuance of letters of credit. The borrowing base may be reduced by reserves, such as unrealized losses with derivative counterparties who are members of the bank group participating in the facility. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $220.5 million and $219.8 million, respectively, available under our credit facility. See Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information concerning this credit facility. Investment in Keytrade Keytrade is a reseller of fertilizer products that it purchases from various manufacturers around the world and resells in approximately 50 countries through a network of seven offices. In October 2007, we purchased 50% of the common shares of Keytrade, for $25.9 million and advanced an additional $13.7 million in the form of subordinated financing and preferred stock. The subordinated financing is in the form of notes that mature September 30, 2017 and bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. In the fourth quarter of 2008, these notes were re denominated into U.S. dollars from their previous basis of Swiss francs. Under the terms of a commercial agreement we executed with Keytrade concurrent with our investment, we utilize Keytrade as our exclusive exporter of phosphate fertilizer products from North America and as our exclusive importer of UAN products into North America. We terminated our previous membership in PhosChem and no longer utilize them to export phosphate fertilizers. We account for Keytrade as an equity method investment. See Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information concerning the Keytrade investment. Capital Spending Capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base, to increase our capacity, to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. Of the $36.7 million increase in capital expenditures in 2008 as compared to 2007, approximately $43.7 million related to plant and equipment expenditures offset by a reduction of expenditures of $7.0 million in plant turnaround activity during 2008. We expect to spend approximately $200 million to $300 million on routine capital expenditures in 2009. This amount also includes approximately $28 million for capital expenditures at CFL, of which we are obligated to fund 66%. Forward Pricing Program (FPP) We use our FPP to reduce margin risk created by the volatility of fertilizer prices and natural gas costs. Through the program, we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. As our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase contracts with us, we generally lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by using natural gas derivative instruments and fixed price purchase contracts to hedge against price changes for natural gas that will be purchased in the future. Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen based fertilizers. As a result of using derivative instruments to hedge against movements of future prices of natural gas, volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized mark to market adjustments in the value of the derivatives. Unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products for which we effectively fix the cost of natural gas, we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials, such as sulfur and ammonia, which 53 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. are among the largest components of our phosphate costs. As a result, we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis. A significant portion of the sales proceeds from FPP orders generally are collected in advance of shipment, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had approximately $347.8 million and $305.8 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had approximately 1.4 million tons and 3.0 million tons, respectively, of nitrogen and phosphate product committed to be sold under the FPP. Most of this product was scheduled to ship within the next six months. While customer advances were a significant source of liquidity in both 2008 and 2007, the level of sales under the FPP is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers perceptions of future market fundamentals. The lower level of sales on order as of December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 may reflect our customers expectations concerning the current fertilizer pricing environment and future expectations regarding pricing and availability of supply. Under the FPP, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors. These delayed shipments are subject to charges to the customer for storage. Such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of an FPP contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported results and financial position or liquidity. If the level of sales under the FPP were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease, and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Also, borrowing under our senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary. Due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future FPP sales activity. Natural Gas Derivatives We use natural gas derivative instruments primarily to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on sales under the forward pricing program. Our natural gas acquisition policy also allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements, unrelated to our forward pricing program. Natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. The counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are either large oil and gas companies or large financial institutions. Cash collateral is deposited with or received from counterparties when predetermined unrealized gain or loss thresholds are exceeded. For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. We control our credit risk through the use of several counterparties and establishing credit limits, monitoring procedures, cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements. The master netting arrangements to our derivative instruments also contain credit risk related contingent features that require us to maintain a minimum net worth level and certain financial ratios. If we fail to meet these minimum requirements, the counterparties to derivative instruments that are in net liability positions could require daily settlement of unrealized losses or some other form of credit support. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit risk related contingent features in a net liability position was $84.6 million for which we had $10.8 million of cash collateral on deposit with counterparties. This cash collateral is included within margin deposits in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet. If we had failed to meet all credit risk contingent thresholds as of December 31, 2008, we could have been required to post up to an additional $73.8 million of collateral with derivative counterparties. 54 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Financial Assurance Requirements In addition to various operational and environmental regulations related to our phosphate segment, we are subject to financial assurance requirements. Pursuant to the Florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure of phosphogypsum stacks, we established an escrow account to meet such future obligations. We made annual contributions of $6.2 million, $9.4 million and $11.1 million in February of 2008, February of 2007 and March of 2006, respectively, to this escrow account, which by rule is earmarked to cover the closure, long term maintenance, and monitoring costs for our phosphogypsum stacks, as well as any costs incurred to manage the water contained in the stack system upon closure. In the first quarter of 2009, we expect to contribute another $7.5 million. Over the subsequent seven years, we expect to contribute between $3.0 million and $7.0 million annually based upon the required funding formula as defined in the regulations and an assumed rate of return of 2% on invested funds. The amount of money that will accumulate in the account by the year 2016, including interest earned on invested funds, is currently estimated to be approximately $77 million. After 2016, contributions to the account are estimated to average approximately $5.0 million annually for the following 17 years. The balance in the account is estimated to be approximately $210 million by 2033. The amounts recognized as expense in operations pertaining to our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and accounted for on an accrual basis as described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. These expense amounts are expected to differ from the anticipated contributions to the account, which are based on the guidelines set forth in the Florida regulations. Ultimately, the cash in this account will be used to settle the asset retirement obligations. Florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation, wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities. We will also be required to demonstrate financial responsibility for reclamation and for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures, if and when we are able to expand our Hardee mining activities to areas not currently permitted. The demonstration of financial responsibility by mining companies in Florida may be provided by passing a financial test or by establishing a cash deposit arrangement. Based on these current regulations, we will have the option to demonstrate financial responsibility in Florida utilizing either of these methods. Other Liquidity Requirements During the fourth quarter of 2008, we repurchased 8.5 million shares of our common stock for approximately $500 million (at an average price of $58.96 per share) under a program authorized by our Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2008, these shares were retired reducing additional paid in capital by approximately $124 million and reducing retained earnings by approximately $376 million. We paid cash dividends of $22.0 million on outstanding common stock during 2008. This amount represents an annual rate equal to $0.40 per common share. In February of 2008, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.02 to $0.10 per common share. We expect to pay quarterly dividends at such a rate for the foreseeable future. Under certain conditions, our $250 million credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends. As a result of the credit crisis during the later part of 2008 and continuing into 2009, an investment manager for our U.S. pension plan began implementing restrictions on full withdrawals or transfers of assets from certain mutual funds due to the fact that certain securities within these funds were illiquid. Investors seeking to liquidate their positions fully would receive a portion of the redemption in cash, and the remainder in a pro rata distribution of the individual illiquid securities. Investors are also required to provide more advanced notice of redemptions and the ultimate settlement of the redemption could be extended depending on available liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of our consolidated pension assets was approximately $181.6 million, of which 55 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. approximately $8.5 million were invested with this particular investment manager and are illiquid. These investments have been valued in accordance with SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements. The liquidity limitations have not impacted the plans ability to make pension benefit payments nor do we expect them to limit its ability to satisfy benefit payment obligations. We funded contributions to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans totaling $9.6 million in 2008. We expect to contribute approximately $16.0 million to our pension plans in 2009. Cash Flows Operating Activities Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2008 was $638.6 million compared to $690.1 million in 2007. The $51.5 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2008 was due primarily to a $546.2 million decrease in cash generated by working capital changes offset by a $487.2 million increase in pre tax earnings. The $546.2 million change in cash generated by working capital changes is the difference between the $392.4 million consumed in 2008 and the $153.8 million generated in 2007. During 2008, the cash consumed by working capital changes was due primarily to a $416.7 million increase in inventories. The increase in inventories reflects higher quantities held and higher per unit manufacturing costs of ammonia and phosphate fertilizer at December 31, 2008. During the second half of 2008, we acquired approximately $147 million of potash fertilizer which remains in inventory. The $153.8 million of cash generated by working capital changes in 2007 arose from the $203.1 million increase in customer advances and the $31.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a $53.6 million increase in inventories and a $28.5 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in customer advances was due to an increase in the level of forward sales under our FPP and higher average contracted selling prices. Remaining unpaid amounts of customer advances are generally collected by the time the product is shipped. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is due primarily to an increase in nitrogen fertilizer product purchases. The increase in inventories was due to increased prices for purchased product, higher manufacturing costs for phosphate products and higher quantities of both nitrogen and phosphate products held at December 31, 2007. The increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to the increase in amounts due from our minority interest partner. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net cash generated from operating activities in 2007 was $690.1 million compared to $203.6 million in 2006. The $486.5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was due primarily to a $339.4 million increase in net earnings and a $162.5 million increase in cash generated by working capital changes. The $162.5 million increase in cash generated by working capital changes is the difference between the $153.8 million generated in 2007 and the $8.7 million consumed in 2006. During 2007, the cash generated by the $203.1 million increase in customer advances and the $31.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was partially offset by a $53.6 million increase in inventories and a $28.5 million increase in accounts receivable. The increase in customer advances was due to an increase in the level of forward sales under our FPP and higher average contracted selling prices. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is due primarily to an increase in nitrogen fertilizer product purchases. The increase in inventories was due to increased prices for purchased product, higher manufacturing costs for phosphate products and higher quantities of both nitrogen and phosphate products held at December 31, 2007. The increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to the increase in amounts due from our minority interest partner. The use of $8.7 million in cash in 2006 for working capital changes was due primarily to a $62.4 million increase in accounts receivable and a $28.9 million decrease in customer advances, partially offset by a 56 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. $51.6 million decrease in inventories and a $17.1 million decrease in margin deposits. The increase in accounts receivable was due primarily to higher volume shipped under normal commercial terms. The decrease in customer advances was due primarily to changes in the product mix of outstanding orders and lower average contract prices. The decrease in inventories reflects lower per unit nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing cost and lower quantities of phosphate fertilizers held at December 31, 2006. The decrease in margin deposits was due primarily to lower margin requirements. Investing Activities Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 Net cash provided by investing activities was $159.5 million in 2008 compared to $343.1 million net cash used in investing activities in 2007. The $502.6 million increase in cash provided by investing activities in 2008 was due primarily to net sales of investments of $295.9 million during 2008 as compared to $194.3 million of net purchases during 2007, resulting from our decision to discontinue investing in auction rate securities. The proceeds from the sales of our investments in securities in 2008 were generally invested in cash equivalents. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this discussion and analysis for additional information concerning these investments. The $151.8 million increase in cash used in investing activities in 2007 from 2006, was due primarily to net purchases of short term investments of $194.3 million during 2007 compared to $120.9 million of net purchases during 2006, resulting from increased cash available for investment net of other investing activities. Additions to property, plant and equipment accounted for $141.8 million, $105.1 million, and $59.6 million of cash used in investing activities in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in additions to property, plant and equipment in 2008 as compared to 2007 included a $43.7 million increase in capital projects offset by a $7.0 million decrease in plant turnaround related expenditures. The increase in additions to property, plant and equipment in 2007 was due primarily to a $23.9 million increase in capital projects as well as a $22.0 million increase in plant turnaround related expenditures. As previously discussed, we made annual contributions of $6.2 million in February of 2008, $9.4 million in February of 2007 and $11.1 million in March of 2006 to our asset retirement obligation escrow account. The balance in this account is reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. In 2007, investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates of $39.6 million represented our investment in Keytrade and funding of related subordinated debt. Financing Activities Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 Net cash used in financing activities was $540.5 million, $4.9 million and $23.3 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $535.6 million increase in cash used in financing activities in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock of $500.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 as previously discussed. In addition, dividends paid on common stock increased $17.5 million due to an increase of the quarterly dividend to $0.10 per common share from $0.02 per common share. During 2008, we received $10.1 million of proceeds from stock options exercised under the 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan. Distributions to minority interest increased $22.7 million to $52.7 million in 2008 from $30.0 million in 2007 due to CFLs improved 2007 net earnings (distributed in 2008). The $18.4 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2007 versus 2006 was due to the impact of activity related to stock based compensation, partially offset by higher distributions to minority interest. We received $16.6 million of proceeds from stock options exercised under the 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan during 2007. Distributions to minority interest were higher in 2007 due to the improvement in CFLs 2006 net earnings (distributed in 2007) as compared to CFLs 2005 net earnings (distributed in 2006). 57  Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

(2)Represents notes payable to the CFL minority interest holder. While the entire principal amount is due December 31, 2009, CFL may prepay all or a portion of the principal at its sole option. (3)Includes anticipated expenditures under certain requirements contracts to transport raw materials and finished product between our facilities. The majority of these arrangements allow for reductions in usage based on our actual operating rates. Amounts set forth above are based on projected normal operating rates and contracted or current spot prices, where applicable, as of December 31, 2008 and actual operating rates and prices may differ. (4)Includes minimum commitments to purchase natural gas based on prevailing NYMEX and AECO forward prices at December 31, 2008. Also includes minimum commitments to purchase ammonia and urea for resale and commitments to purchase ammonia and sulfur for use in phosphate fertilizer production. The amounts set forth above for these commitments are based on spot prices as of December 31, 2008 and actual prices may differ. (5)Liquid markets exist for the possible resale of the natural gas, ammonia and urea purchased for resale and ammonia and sulfur purchased for use in phosphate fertilizer production under most of these commitments, but gains or losses could be incurred on resale. (6)Purchase obligations do not include any amounts related to our financial hedges (i.e. swaps) associated with natural gas purchases. (7)Represents the minimum contractual commitment to Keytrade for handling UAN import and phosphate export transactions per the terms of a commercial agreement we have with Keytrade. 58 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. (8)Represents the contributions we expect to make to our pension plans in 2009. Our pension funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum legal funding requirements plus discretionary amounts that we may deem to be appropriate. (9)Excludes $74.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty in the timing of payments, if any, on these items. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of these unrecognized tax benefits. Other Long Term Obligations As of December 31, 2008, our other liabilities included balances related to asset retirement obligations (AROs) and environmental remediation liabilities. The estimated timing and amount of cash outflows associated with these liabilities are as follows: Payments Due by Period 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 After 2013 Total (in millions) Other Long Term Obligations Asset retirement obligations(1)(2) $ 11.3 $ 9.5 $ 4.9 $ 6.9 $ 4.4 $ 634.0 $ 671.0 Environmental remediation liabilities 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 4.7 6.7 Total $ 11.7 $ 9.9 $ 5.3 $ 7.3 $ 4.8 $ 638.7 $ 677.7 (1)Represents the undiscounted, inflation adjusted estimated cash outflows required to settle the recorded AROs. The corresponding present value of these future expenditures is $100.7 million as of December 31, 2008. We also have unrecorded AROs at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex, at CFLs Medicine Hat facility and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included is reclamation of land and, in the case of Donaldsonville, reclamation of two effluent ponds. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in 2008 dollars is approximately $20 million. Currently, we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at these facilities. Therefore, the table above does not contain any cash flows for these AROs. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of our AROs. As described in "Financial Assurance Requirements," we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in an escrow account established to cover costs associated with closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems. This account will be the source of a significant portion of the cash required to settle the AROs pertaining to the phosphogypsum stack systems. (2)Cash flows occurring after 2013 are detailed in the following table. The following table details the undiscounted, inflation adjusted estimated cash flows after 2013 required to settle the recorded AROs, as discussed above.

Subsequent Events On January 15, 2009, we announced that we had made a proposal to Terra Industries Inc. (Terra) to acquire all of Terras outstanding common stock at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.4235 shares of CF Holdings common stock for each share of Terra common stock. On January 28, 2009, Terra announced that its Board of Directors had rejected the proposal. On February 3, 2009, we delivered a notice to Terra, in accordance with Terras bylaws, nominating three individuals for election as Terra directors at Terras 2009 annual meeting of stockholders. Also on February 3, 2009, we issued a press release in connection with this notice and announced our intention to commence an exchange offer for all of Terras outstanding common stock at the exchange ratio set forth in our proposal. On February 23, 2009, we filed a registration statement on Form S 4 and related documents with the SEC and commenced the exchange offer. The exchange offer is conditioned upon, among other things, CF Holdings entering into a merger agreement with Terra, Terra stockholders tendering in the offer at least a majority of Terras outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis, the approval by our stockholders of the issuance of our common stock in the transaction and the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. On February 25, 2009, Agrium Inc. (Agrium) announced that it had made a proposal to our Board of Directors to acquire all of our outstanding common stock in a cash and stock transaction. The offer is conditioned upon, among other things, the termination of our above described offer to acquire Terra, the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement between Agrium and us, approval by our Board of Directors and shareholders, and necessary regulatory approvals. On February 25, 2009, we announced that our Board of Directors will evaluate the proposal carefully and respond to Agriums proposal in due course. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of fertilizer, and a corporate office lease. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from one to seven years and the barge charter commitments currently have terms ranging from one to three years. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements at several of our distribution locations, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party. In 2006, we entered into a ten year operating lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters located in Deerfield, Illinois. The corporate office lease agreement includes leasehold incentives, rent holidays and scheduled rent increases that are expensed on a straight line basis in accordance with SFAS No. 13 Accounting for Leases. Our other operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents, leasehold incentives, rent holidays, scheduled rent increases, concessions or unusual provisions. See Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information concerning leases. We do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance 60 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, rebates, or creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change as market conditions change. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statement of operations. Assets Held for Sale In 2006, we decided to sell our corporate office facility in Long Grove, Illinois and in 2007 we relocated our corporate headquarters to Deerfield, Illinois. As of December 31, 2007, the net book value of the Long Grove building and related land ($6.7 million) was classified as assets held for sale. The Long Grove facility consisted of an office building and a parcel of excess land. In the first quarter of 2008, due to a decline in the real estate market and a deteriorating credit market, negotiations with potential buyers of the building stalled, and we no longer considered it probable that it would be sold within one year. As a result, as of March 31, 2008, we reclassified the carrying value of the building ($6.1 million) back to property, plant and equipment and recognized $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2008 for the associated depreciation for the period of time it was classified as held for sale and reinitiated depreciation. We sold the excess land in July of 2008 and we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately $4.3 million in the third quarter of 2008. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information concerning these assets. Useful Lives of Depreciable Assets Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using either the straight line method or the units of production (UOP) method over the lives of the assets. The lives used in computing depreciation expense are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us. Estimated lives are based on historical experience, manufacturers estimates, engineering or appraisal estimates and future business plans. We review the depreciable lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment on a periodic basis, and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews. Scheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities are referred to as plant turnarounds. Expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized into property, plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straight line basis over the period benefited, which is generally until the next scheduled turnaround in up to 5 years. At the end of 2006, we completed a comprehensive review of the depreciable lives of our production facilities and related assets, as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our UOP depreciation expense. As a result of this review, we increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production facilities. Separately, we revised the estimates of production capacities for certain UOP assets. As a result of these changes, depreciation expense was reduced by $11.5 million for 2007. 61 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Inventory Valuation We review our inventory balances at least quarterly, and more frequently if required by market conditions, to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value. This review process incorporates current industry and customer specific trends, current operating plans, historical price activity, and selling prices expected to be realized. If the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its estimated net realizable value, we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly. Upon inventory liquidation, if the actual sales prices ultimately realized are less than our initial estimate of net realizable value, additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation. Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Remediation Liabilities Costs associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum stack systems at the Bartow and Plant City, Florida phosphate fertilizer complexes and costs associated with land reclamation activities at our Hardee, Florida phosphate rock mine are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. If the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated, asset retirement obligations (AROs) are recognized in the period in which the related assets are put into service. Costs associated with the cessation of operations at all of our facilities are accounted for in accordance with FIN No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. This interpretation requires us to recognize an ARO for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. The obligations related to closure, reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded. The liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense. Accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability due to the passage of time. The asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over their estimated useful life. The aggregate carrying value of all of our AROs was $100.7 million as of December 31, 2008 and $89.4 million as of December 31, 2007. The increase in the aggregate carrying value of these AROs is due to recording changes in estimates and normal accretion expense offset by cash expenditures on existing AROs as previously discussed. Environmental remediation liabilities are recognized when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies. Estimates of these costs are based upon currently available facts, existing technology, site specific costs and currently enacted laws and regulations. In reporting environmental liabilities, no offset is made for potential recoveries. All liabilities are monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur. In accordance with GAAP, environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide future economic benefits. Changes in laws, regulations or assumptions used in estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial statements. The amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities totaled $6.7 million as of December 31, 2008 and $8.1 million as of December 31, 2007. The actual amounts to be spent on AROs and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments and cost inflation, as well as present and future environmental laws and regulations. The estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to considerable uncertainty and long timeframes. Changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Recoverability of Long Lived Assets and Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries We review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment, as well as other long lived assets on a regular basis in accordance with SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal 62 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. of Long Lived Assets. We also review the carrying value of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries on a regular basis in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. If impairment of an asset or investment has occurred, an impairment charge is recognized immediately. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, prices, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The recoverability of the values associated with our long lived assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Fair Value Measurements We adopted SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements as of January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2008 we also considered the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (FSP) No. 157 3 Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active in determining the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities. We have classified our investments in auction rate securities as Level 3 securities (those measured using significant unobservable inputs) under the provisions of SFAS No. 157. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this discussion and analysis for detailed information concerning the critical accounting estimates involved in valuing and classifying these investments. No other assets or liabilities are classified as Level 3 items in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for additional information concerning fair value measurements. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and non operating net, respectively. In connection with our initial public offering (IPO) in August 2005, CF Industries, Inc. (CFI) ceased to be a non exempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes, and we entered into a net operating loss agreement (NOL Agreement) with CFIs pre IPO owners relating to the future utilization of the pre IPO net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs). Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that the NOLs can be utilized to offset applicable post IPO taxable income, we will pay the pre IPO owners amounts equal to the resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved. In the third quarter of 2008, we took tax positions utilizing a portion of the NOLs, resulting in an increase in our unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10 K for additional discussion concerning NOLs and the NOL agreement. Pension Assets and Liabilities Pension assets and liabilities are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Our 63 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. projected benefit obligation (PBO) related to our qualified pension plans was $247.2 million at December 31, 2008, which was $65.6 million higher than pension plan assets. The December 31, 2008 PBO was computed based on a 6.50% discount rate, which was based on yields for high quality (Aa rated or better) fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of December 31. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. If the discount rate used to compute the PBO was lower by 50 basis points, our PBO would have been $16.9 million higher than the amount previously discussed. Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute the PBO was higher by 50 basis points, our PBO would have been $15.2 million lower. The discount rate used to calculate pension expense in 2008 was 6.00%. If the discount rate used to compute 2008 pension expense was lower by 50 basis points, the expense would have been approximately $1.7 million higher than the amount calculated. Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute 2008 pension expense was higher by 50 basis points, the expense would have been approximately $0.8 million lower than the amount calculated. Our net benefit obligation, after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate. The 7.3% expected long term rate of return on assets is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non equity investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding periods. If the expected long term rate of return on assets was higher by 50 basis points, pension expense for 2008 would have been $1.1 million lower. Conversely, if the expected long term rate of return on assets was lower by 50 basis points, pension expense for 2008 would have been $1.1 million higher. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of our pension plans. Retiree Medical Benefits Retiree medical benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions, including discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and expected increases in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded amount of retiree medical benefits expense. Stock Based Compensation Costs associated with stock based compensation are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123R Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all stock based awards over the service period. The fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black Scholes option valuation model. Key assumptions used in the Black Scholes option valuation model include expected volatility and expected term. The weighted average expected volatility used to value the stock options granted in 2008 was 58%. If the expected volatility was 2% higher or lower, the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 2.6% higher or lower, respectively. The expected term of the stock options granted in 2008 was five years. If the expected term was six months higher or lower, the fair value of the stock options would have been approximately 4.3% higher or lower, respectively. The basis for determining these assumptions may change as more experience is obtained with our own historical stock prices and employees option exercise behavior. We accrue the cost of stock based awards on the straight line method over the applicable vesting period. As a result, total compensation cost recognized for 2008 on a pre tax basis was $8.3 million. As of December 31, 2008, on a pre tax basis there was approximately $8.1 million and $3.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted stock which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 and 2.1 years, respectively. See Note 28 to our 64 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of stock based compensation. Consolidation We consolidate all entities that we control by ownership of a majority interest as well as variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Our judgment in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our level of involvement in setting up the entity, determining whether the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on our behalf, determining whether we provide more than half the subordinated financial support to the entity, and determining whether we absorb the majority of the entitys expected losses or returns. We use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Our consolidated net earnings include our share of the net earnings of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over our equity method investment includes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy decisions and material intercompany transactions. We eliminate from our consolidated financial results all significant intercompany transactions. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Following are summaries of accounting pronouncements that were either recently adopted or may become applicable to our consolidated financial statements. Recently Adopted Pronouncements Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157 Fair Value Measurements, and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but does define fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. FSP No. FAS 157 2 delays for one year the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The deferral is intended to allow the FASB and constituents additional time to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen, or that may arise, from the application of SFAS No. 157. As of January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 and the one year partial deferral guidance in FSP No. FAS 157 2. For additional information, see Note 5 Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements. FSP No. FAS 157 3 Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active. This FSP clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. The adoption of this guidance in 2008 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For additional information, see Note 5 Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements. FSP No. FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities. This FSP expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 140 and FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 46(R). With respect to FIN No. 46(R), public enterprises must provide an understanding of significant judgments and assumptions made by a company in determining whether it must consolidate a variable interest 65 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. entity (VIE) and disclose information about its involvement with a VIE. In addition, disclosures are required regarding the nature of restrictions on a consolidated VIEs assets as well as the carrying amounts of such assets, the nature of the risks associated with the involvement with a VIE and how a companys involvement with a VIE affects a companys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. We adopted FSP No. FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8 as of December 31, 2008. The additional SFAS No. 140 disclosure requirements did not impact us, however, the additional FIN 46(R) disclosures are provided in Note 4 Canadian Fertilizers Limited to our consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Pronouncements SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007) Business Combinations. This Statement applies to business combinations other than joint ventures, asset acquisitions, businesses under common control and not for profit organizations. It requires the acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair values as of the acquisition date. This Statement also requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred, restructuring costs to be expensed in the period subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date to impact tax expense. This Statement also requires the acquirer in an acquisition implemented in stages to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values. This Statement is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date after December 31, 2008. SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51. This Statement establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. The Statement clarifies that changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this Statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. The Statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. The Statement is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2009. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 160, the presentation and reporting of the minority interest related to Canadian Fertilizers Limited will change to reflect the new requirements. 66 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. This FSP applies to the calculation of earnings per share (EPS) under SFAS No. 128 for share based payment awards with rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Upon adoption of this FSP, unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two class method. This FSP is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2009 with retrospective adjustment to previously reported EPS for comparative purposes. The impact of adoption of this FSP on historical EPS is summarized below. Year ended December 31 2008 2007 2006 As Reported Pro forma(1) As Reported Pro forma(1) As Reported Pro forma(1) (in millions, except per share amounts) Weighted average shares outstanding Basic 55.3 55.4 55.5 55.7 55.0 55.1 Diluted 56.4 56.4 56.7 56.8 55.1 55.1 Earnings per common share Basic $ 12.39 $ 12.35 $ 6.71 $ 6.70 $ 0.60 $ 0.60 Diluted $ 12.15 $ 12.13 $ 6.57 $ 6.56 $ 0.60 $ 0.60 (1)Reflects the retrospective adjustment for adoption of FSP No. EITF 03 6 1 that will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2009. EITF Issue No. 08 6 Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations. This EITF Issue applies to all investments accounted for under the equity method and clarifies the accounting for the initial measurement, impairment and changes in ownership interests for such investments. EITF 08 6 should be applied on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not expect this EITF Issue to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, but it will need to be considered for applicable transactions and impairments occurring after December 31, 2008. Forward Pricing Program (FPP) Our FPP seeks to reduce the risk inherent in the relationship between volatile fertilizer prices and natural gas costs for product that we manufacture. Our basic concept (when applied to nitrogen fertilizers) is to fix the price of our principal raw material, natural gas, coincident with the establishment of the fertilizer sales price, which often occurs months in advance of shipment. Customer advances, which typically represent a significant portion of the contracts sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with the FPP are reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders are shipped, which can take up to several months. As is the case for all of our sale transactions, revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers. We lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative instruments, or, in some cases, with a combination of inventory on hand and product purchases. Unlike our nitrogen fertilizer products for which we effectively fix the cost of natural gas, we typically are unable to fix the cost of phosphate raw materials, such as sulfur and ammonia, which are 67 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. among the largest components of our phosphate costs. As a result, we typically are exposed to margin risk on phosphate products sold on a forward basis. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we sold approximately 5.6 million, 5.4 million and 3.0 million tons of fertilizer, representing approximately 71%, 60% and 36% of our sales volume, respectively, under the FPP. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had approximately 1.4 million tons of product and 3.0 million tons of product, respectively, committed to be sold under this program. Most of these amounts were scheduled to ship within six months of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products and a substantial portion of the cost to manufacture the nitrogen products under our FPP, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Participation in the FPP is affected by market conditions and our customers expectations. There can be no assurance that we will transact the same percentage of our business under the FPP in the future. Under the FPP, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors. These delayed shipments are subject to charges to the customer for storage. Such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of an FPP contract due to a customers inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported results and financial position. Should the level of participation decrease, there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods. Discussion of Seasonality Impacts on Operations Our sales of fertilizers to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature. The strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and or our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns. 68  Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are exposed to the impact of changes in the valuation of our investments, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Investments in Auction Rate Securities As of December 31, 2008, we had $177.8 million of investments in auction rate securities consisting of available for sale tax exempt auction rate securities that were all supported by student loans that were originated primarily under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Due to the illiquidity in the credit markets, auctions for these securities have failed. As a result, these investments are no longer liquid investments and we will not be able to access these funds until such time as auctions for these securities are successful, buyers are found outside of the auction process, and or the securities are redeemed by the issuer. Further details regarding these securities are included in Notes 5 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources, both in this Form 10 K. The valuation of these securities utilizes a mark to model approach that relies on discounted cash flows, market data and inputs that are derived from similar instruments. Based on this valuation, we reflected a $20.8 million pre tax unrealized holding loss against the historical cost basis of these investments as of December 31, 2008. The unrealized holding loss has been reported in other comprehensive income and the impact of the unrealized holding loss is recorded in the net $177.8 million investment balance in auction rate securities. If the required rate of return we used in the calculation model was 100 basis points higher, the resulting holding loss would have been approximately $10 million higher. We may need to recognize either additional holding gains or losses in other comprehensive income or holding losses in net earnings should changes occur in either the conditions in the credit markets or in the variables considered in our valuation model. Upon a failed auction, the instrument carries an interest rate based upon certain predefined formulas. A 100 basis point change in the average rate of interest earned on these investments would result in a $2.0 million change in pre tax income on an annual basis. Interest Rate Fluctuations As of December 31, 2008, we had notes payable of approximately $4.1 million that had a floating interest rate. A 100 basis point change in interest rates on our notes payable, would result in a $40,000 change in pre tax income on an annual basis. The senior secured revolving credit facility bears a current market rate of interest such that we are subject to interest rate risk on borrowings under this facility. As of December 31, 2008, there were no borrowings under this facility. Our advances to unconsolidated affiliates consisted of floating rate subordinated debt owed to us by Keytrade totaling $12.4 million as of December 31, 2008. A 100 basis point change in interest rates on this subordinated debt would result in $124,000 change in pretax earnings on an annual basis. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar as a result of our 66% economic interest and our 49% common equity interest in CFL. We have made advances to CFL of $9.6 million Canadian Dollars. At the present time, we do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to CFL. 69 Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC. Commodity Prices Our net sales, cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to the nitrogen and phosphate sales not made under our forward pricing program are sensitive to changes in nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials. A $1.00 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia, urea and UAN (28%) by approximately $33, $22 and $12, respectively. We use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen products. Because natural gas prices are volatile, our Natural Gas Acquisition Policy includes the objective of providing protection against significant adverse natural gas price movements. We manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years. The derivative instruments that we currently use are natural gas swap contracts. These contracts settle using NYMEX futures (for Donaldsonville) or AECO (for Medicine Hat) price indexes, which represent fair value at any given time. The contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. We account for derivatives under SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by subsequent standards. Under these standards, derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and changes in their fair value are recognized immediately in earnings, unless the normal purchase and sale exemption applies. We use natural gas derivatives primarily as an economic hedge of gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur. Cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we had open derivative contracts for 16.7 million MMBtus and 39.1 million MMBtus, respectively, of natural gas, most of which related to sales that had been contracted to be sold through our forward pricing program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we used derivatives to cover approximately 96% of our natural gas consumption at Donaldsonville and approximately 86% of our two thirds share of gas consumption at Medicine Hat. An overall $1.00 per MMBtu change in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change the pre tax unrealized mark to market gain/loss on these derivative positions by $16.7 million. We purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials in the production of DAP and MAP. We attempt to include any price fluctuations related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products, but there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always be recovered. We enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia and sulfur at market prices. A $10 per ton change in the related cost of a ton of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change DAP production cost by $2.10 per ton and $3.80 per ton, respectively. We also purchase ammonia, urea and UAN to augment or replace production at our facilities. 70  Table of Contents CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.
