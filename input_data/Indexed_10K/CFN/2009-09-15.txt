BUSINESS Overview We are a global medical technology company with clinically proven and industry leading products and services designed to measurably improve the safety and quality of healthcare. Our offerings include established brands used in hospitals throughout the United States and in more than 120 countries worldwide. We offer comprehensive product lines in the areas of intravenous, or IV, infusion, medication and supply dispensing, respiratory care, infection prevention and surgical instruments. Our primary product brands include: Alaris IV infusion systems that feature our proprietary Guardrails software, an application that alerts the clinician when a parameter is outside the institutions pre established limitations for that medication, thereby helping to reduce IV medication errors; Pyxis automated medication dispensing systems that provide comprehensive medication management and Pyxis automated medical supply dispensing systems; AVEA and Pulmonetic Systems ventilation and respiratory products, and Jaeger and SensorMedics pulmonary products; ChloraPrep products that help prevent vascular and surgical site infections and MedMined software and surveillance services that help target and reduce hospital acquired infections, or HAIs; and V. Mueller surgical instruments and related products and services. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, we generated revenue of $4.5 billion in each year, and net income of $568 million in fiscal 2009 and $663 million in fiscal 2008. Approximately 76% of our fiscal 2009 revenue was from customers in the United States and 24% was from customers outside of the United States. Separation from Cardinal Health We were incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 2009 for the purpose of holding Cardinal Health, Inc.s clinical and medical products businesses in anticipation of spinning off from Cardinal Health. We completed the spinoff from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health contributed the majority of the businesses comprising its clinical and medical products segment to us (the contribution), and distributed approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 179.8 million shares, to its shareholders (the distribution), based on a distribution ratio of 0.5 shares of our common stock for each common share of Cardinal Health held on the record date of August 25, 2009. Cardinal Health retained approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 41.4 million shares, in connection with the spinoff. As a condition to the separation, Cardinal Health is required to dispose of the remaining 19% of our common stock within five years of the distribution date. Until our separation from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009, CareFusion Corporation was a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health. Accordingly, our historical financial information for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and prior years does not reflect our results as a separate, stand alone company. In this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we describe the businesses contributed to us by Cardinal Health in the spinoff as if they were our businesses for all historical periods described. References in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to our historical assets, liabilities, products, businesses or activities of our business are generally intended to refer to the historical assets, liabilities, products, businesses or activities of the contributed businesses as the business were conducted as part of Cardinal Health and its subsidiaries prior to the spinoff. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health retained certain lines of business that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the U.S. markets that were historically managed by us prior to the spinoff, which were part of the clinical and medical products businesses of Cardinal Health. These lines of businesses are 5 Table of Contents reflected in the CareFusion financial information included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K, primarily in the medical technologies and services segment. Going forward, starting with our Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, these businesses will be presented within our financial statements as discontinued operations as of the spinoff date of August 31, 2009. Our Strengths We possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, including: Scale and focus. We are one of the largest medical technology companies in the world, with long standing customer relationships, a global presence, and a focus on helping clinicians improve patient safety. The prevalence and magnitude of medical errors and HAIs have put patient safety among the top issues for hospitals, regulators and payers in the United States and increasingly, worldwide. We believe that we are well positioned to address these global quality and patient safety needs by providing products and services that help hospitals and other healthcare providers prevent medication errors, reduce infections, and manage medications and supplies more efficiently. Technology leadership and innovation. We have a long history of innovation and developing products and services that enable our customers to deliver safer and more cost effective patient care. We pioneered the concept of a smart infusion pump that alerts the clinician when a parameter is outside the institutions pre established limitations for that medication, and we created the market for medication dispensing machines that automate the management of medications from the pharmacy to the nursing unit. We have also integrated our products with other information systems within the hospital, including financial and business systems that support patient admissions, discharges and transfers, operational systems that include inventory management and clinical systems that include pharmacy information and electronic medical records. We were the first to integrate automated supply dispensing systems with clinical information systems that enable clinicians to chart, charge and reorder supplies with the touch of a button. Today, we have an extensive library of healthcare information system interfaces, with almost 17,000 distinct interfaces to almost 300 vendor systems in almost 3,500 facilities domestically. These interfaces allow us to integrate our products with any of the major information technology products in healthcare. In the respiratory care arena, we have strong positions with technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary and sleep related disorders. We believe that our strong heritage of leadership and innovation provides us with a solid foundation for the continued development of safe and cost effective products that will enable us to continue to grow our revenue. Industry expertise. We employ a wide range of experienced clinical professionals, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists, who bring a detailed understanding of how providers use our products and the current state of clinical practice, including best practices for infusion, medication management, infection prevention and respiratory therapy. These experts enable us to develop innovative and industry leading products and services because of their in depth understanding of the medical and clinical protocols for our products. Focus on customer service. As of June 30, 2009, we employed more than 700 sales people in the United States and over 1,700 field, clinical and technical service personnel for our capital equipment businesses. We work with our customers to optimize their workflow as we meet their equipment needs, allowing them to deliver the highest level of patient care and reduce operating costs. We provide on site clinical and technical support, product effectiveness tracking and customer training to provide the support necessary to maximize medication safety. Strategy We seek to grow our business by, among other things: Focusing on healthcare safety and productivity. We intend to continue to address the global priority of quality and patient safety by providing products and services that help hospitals and other healthcare providers prevent medication errors, reduce infections and manage medications and supplies more efficiently, which helps to 6 Table of Contents reduce overall costs for our customers. Productivity and safety are rapidly becoming the standards by which healthcare providers are measured and compensated. We intend to continue to expand our product portfolio with additional and enhanced products and services that enable hospitals and other healthcare providers to reduce medication errors and overall treatment costs. Focusing on innovative and clinically proven products. With hospitals and other healthcare providers increasingly adopting outcome based standards as a key part of their decision making processes, we will offer additional and enhanced products and services that demonstrate clinical differentiation by providing a proven solution with simple and compelling economic benefits. We intend to continue to increase our investment in research and development to bring to market products that make it easy for providers to follow evidence based protocols in patient care. In fiscal 2009, we introduced 17 new or enhanced products, and our innovation pipeline includes numerous additional new or enhanced products that are expected to be launched over the next 18 months. For example, we expect to introduce the new EnVe palmtop ventilator which is designed to be the next generation of our ventilator products. In addition, we are in the process of developing a new tight glycemic control module for the Alaris system that helps with rapid glycemic control. Accelerating global growth. Our industry leading positions in the U.S. markets in which we currently operate provide us with a platform for growth outside of the United States. Because our products and technologies have similar applications around the world, we intend to focus on expanding our operations in select developed and emerging markets outside the United States. We intend to leverage our distribution capabilities for infection prevention products in Europe to introduce our ChloraPrep products that are predominantly sold in the United States. We also intend to invest in expanding our research and development capabilities to better tailor products to the needs of markets outside the United States. Pursuing strategic opportunities. We intend to continue to explore organic growth, strategic alliances and acquisition opportunities that enable us to address our customers key concerns of productivity and medication safety. We intend to selectively pursue strategic opportunities that give us access to innovative technologies, complementary product lines or new markets, yet remain consistent with our focus on productivity and safety. Also, from time to time, we expect that we will pursue opportunities to divest certain of our non core businesses to better align our product and service offerings with our customers needs. History and Development Our business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions of established healthcare companies, including the acquisitions described below. Year Line of Business Company Purchase Price1 1996 Automated medication and supply dispensing machines Pyxis Corporation 51 million common shares of Cardinal Health2 1999 Infection prevention products, surgical instruments and interventional specialty products Allegiance Corp.3 106 million common shares of Cardinal Health4 2004 Infusion products ALARIS Medical Systems, Inc. $2.1 billion5 2007 Respiratory care products VIASYS Healthcare Inc. $1.5 billion6 2008 Skin disinfectant products Enturia, Inc. $490 million7 1 All share references in this table are adjusted to reflect all stock splits and stock dividends effected since the time of the applicable acquisition up to, but not including, the distribution of CareFusion common stock in the spinoff from Cardinal Health. 2 In addition, as a result of the acquisition, outstanding Pyxis Corporation stock options were converted into stock options to purchase approximately 5 million common shares of Cardinal Health. 7 Table of Contents 3 Cardinal Health is retaining other lines of business acquired from Allegiance Corp., including the businesses that distribute medical and surgical products to hospitals, laboratories and other healthcare providers and the businesses that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the U.S. market. The results of the businesses that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, surgical drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the U.S. market are reflected in the CareFusion financial information included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K, primarily in the medical technologies and services segment. Going forward, starting with our Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, these businesses will be presented within our financial statements as discontinued operations as of the spinoff date of August 31, 2009. 4 In addition, as a result of the acquisition, outstanding Allegiance Corp. stock options were converted into stock options to purchase approximately 16 million common shares of Cardinal Health. 5 Includes the assumption of approximately $358 million in indebtedness. In addition, as a result of the acquisition, outstanding ALARIS Medical Systems, Inc. stock options were converted into stock options to purchase approximately 0.6 million common shares of Cardinal Health. 6 Includes the assumption of approximately $54 million in indebtedness. In addition, as a result of the acquisition, outstanding VIASYS Healthcare Inc. stock options were converted into stock options to purchase approximately 0.1 million common shares of Cardinal Health. 7 Includes the assumption of approximately $5 million in indebtedness. Business Segments Our business consists of two reporting segments: Critical Care Technologies and Medical Technologies and Services. Critical Care Technologies includes our infusion, dispensing and respiratory care businesses that develop, manufacture and sell capital equipment and related dedicated and non dedicated disposables. Medical Technologies and Services includes our infection prevention and medical specialties products and services businesses that develop, manufacture and sell primarily single use, disposable products and reusable surgical instruments. See note 15 to the audited combined financial statements for certain segment financial data relating to our business. Critical Care Technologies Segment In our Critical Care Technologies segment, we develop, manufacture and market equipment and related supplies for infusion, medication and supply dispensing, and respiratory care. We believe our products enable healthcare professionals to improve patient safety by reducing medication errors and improving administrative controls, while simultaneously improving workflow and increasing operational efficiency. This segment primarily sells capital equipment and related dedicated and non dedicated disposable products. We sell these products primarily through our direct sales force, but use third party distributors as well, particularly outside the United States. Our products in this segment are integrated with other information systems within the hospital, including financial and business systems that support patient admissions, discharges and transfers, operational systems that include inventory management and clinical systems that include pharmacy information and electronic medical records. Today, we have an extensive library of healthcare information system interfaces, with almost 17,000 distinct interfaces to almost 300 vendor systems in almost 3,500 facilities domestically. In addition to our range of infusion and dispensing systems and respiratory products, we also offer a comprehensive group of value added services and programs, software technical services and clinical education. Our project management teams help our customers develop a project implementation plan and help to ensure a rapid, seamless implementation of our products. 8 Table of Contents We also offer a field service organization as well as customer call centers to support our customers before, during and after product installation. Our field service organization provides on site expertise to resolve customers service issues, and we operate several customer call centers to provide additional support to our customers. We also maintain a remote access system to help us quickly diagnose and rapidly resolve customers service issues. The following chart presents the Critical Care Technologies segments key product lines: Key Product Lines Infusion IV medication safety and infusion therapy delivery systems, including dedicated and non dedicated disposables, software applications and related patient monitoring equipment (sold under the Alaris brand) Dispensing Automated dispensing machines and related applications for distributing and managing medication and medical supplies (sold under the Pyxis brand) Respiratory Care Equipment and supplies for ventilation and respiratory and sleep diagnostics (sold under the AVEA, Pulmonetic Systems, Jaeger and SensorMedics brands) Infusion We believe we are a leader in the design, development and marketing of IV medication technology, including IV infusion systems that deliver medications and other fluids directly into a patients veins in precise, measured quantities over a wide range of infusion rates. We believe that we have the largest installed base of infusion pumps (a key component of the infusion system) in the United States. We sell infusion products primarily to hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers and transport services. The international infusion systems market is more regionalized and fragmented than the U.S. market, and we have developed infusion products tailored to meet the different needs of this market. As regions become more aware of the importance of patient safety, we expect the demand for more sophisticated products will increase as it has in the United States. We have an established presence in countries that have already recognized the importance of patient safety, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. Our Alaris system enables healthcare professionals to administer intravenous fluids while at the same time monitoring vital signs such as respiratory activity and blood oxygen levels. The Guardrails software application alerts a clinician when a parameter is outside the institutions pre established limitations (known as a data set) for that medication, thereby helping to reduce IV medication errors. Using a centralized server, data sets can be uploaded wirelessly to the individual Alaris system and continuous quality improvement, or CQI, data can be downloaded from the Alaris system. The CQI data is then used to refine the data sets. In addition, the centralized server makes it possible to send infusion system data to other hospital information systems, including electronic medication administration records, pharmacy information systems, alarms, management applications and documentation systems. We offer a full range of disposable IV administration sets and accessories, many of which feature our proprietary SmartSite needle free valves that reduce caregiver risks associated with accidental needle sticks. In North America, each of our current large volume infusion pumps uses only dedicated disposable administration sets designed and manufactured by or for us for that particular pump. Dispensing We are the leading provider of point of care systems that automate the dispensing of medications and supplies in hospitals and other healthcare facilities in the United States, where about one out of every two acute care hospitals use our flagship product line, the Pyxis MedStation system. We sell our dispensing products primarily to hospitals and other healthcare facilities including oncology clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, long term care facilities and physician offices. 9 Table of Contents Internationally, the standards for clinical and pharmacy practice, the prevalence of clinical information systems and the regulatory and reimbursement policies tend to vary by country and region. As such, the current market for our medication and supply dispensing products is in an early stage of development. We consider the international market for these products to be a long term growth opportunity. Studies show that the medication process is the most complex and therefore one of the largest sources of hospital inefficiencies. In 1989, we championed the concept of decentralized medication management where medications are securely maintained and accessed at the nurses unit and became the first to introduce automated dispensing products to the market. Our products are designed to help healthcare professionals reduce medication errors, enhance administrative controls, improve clinician workflow, increase operational efficiency and improve billing accuracy. Our products enable healthcare professionals to provide safer patient care by helping to ensure that the right medications are delivered in the right doses via the right routes to the right patients at the right times. Our Pyxis medication management products automate the management of medications from the pharmacy to the nursing unit and integrate with other operational and information systems within the hospital. Other Pyxis products focused on medication management include the Pyxis Anesthesia system for medication dispensing in the operating room and the PyxisConnect physician order management system, which streamlines the physician order process, decreases order turnaround time and reduces transcription errors. We have other product offerings that, among other things, help to secure, track and replenish supplies of controlled substances and help to ensure the accuracy of medications picked in the pharmacy and delivered to the Pyxis MedStation system. In addition to medication dispensing, we also offer a comprehensive portfolio of medical supply management systems at the point of use, including the Pyxis SupplyStation system and the Pyxis ProcedureStation system, which are supply dispensing systems with controlled access and radio frequency features that deliver custom solutions tailored to meet the needs of each customer. We also offer wireless handheld technology that supports both our infusion and dispensing businesses. Our positive patient identification applications for bedside verification are a critical enabler of our integrated medication management and patient safety capabilities. Using our wireless handheld technologies for positive patient identification can help healthcare providers ensure the safety and accuracy of medication administration, specimen collection and blood transfusions. We believe these technologies can also improve patient charting and review. To help provide financial flexibility to our customers, we offer them the opportunity to lease our dispensing products. We provide the financing for the majority of our customers under our leasing program rather than relying on third party providers of credit. Respiratory Care We develop, manufacture, market and service products for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary and sleep related disorders. Patients with respiratory conditions are among the highest cost, highest risk, largest and fastest growing hospital populations. Ventilator associated pneumonia, or VAP, is the second most common HAI in the United States. We offer an extensive line of industry leading mechanical ventilators marketed globally that treat respiratory insufficiency caused by illness, injury or premature birth and help to reduce the incidence of VAP. These products are used in a variety of settings, from intensive care units to homecare. We sell our respiratory care products in over 100 countries to a variety of customers including hospitals, clinics, private physicians and research centers. We also offer high frequency oscillatory ventilators, or HFOV, which are specialized devices designed to provide superior pulmonary gas exchange, while protecting the patients lungs from damage that may be caused by the cyclic expansion and contraction characteristic of conventional ventilators. Our HFOV products are 10 Table of Contents primarily used by children and premature infants who suffer acute respiratory failure and by adults for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome. We are one of the largest manufacturers of lung function testing equipment. We offer a broad line of pulmonary function testing equipment, from basic spirometry products, which measure the rate and volume of breathing, to complete pulmonary function and metabolic systems, which measure a wide range of heart, lung and metabolic functions. Other respiratory products we offer include dedicated disposables such as ventilator circuits (tubing used to connect patients to ventilator machines), oxygen masks, cannulae and suction catheters used to clear the trachea. We also have an established presence in the sleep diagnostics market and sell products ranging from basic sleep diagnostic systems that monitor a single patient to networked, modular, expandable sleep labs that can monitor multiple patients simultaneously. Our range of products used to treat obstructive sleep apnea consists of face masks, headgear, replacement filters and tubing, and a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, device for providing the therapy. Medical Technologies and Services Segment In our Medical Technologies and Services segment, we develop, manufacture and market disposable infection prevention products, software based infection detection services, surgical and diagnostic instrumentation and neurological monitoring equipment. The majority of products in this segment are used primarily in the operating room and interventional suites, and to a lesser degree in the critical care departments of hospitals. We sell these products and services through a combination of direct sales representatives and third party distributors. The following chart presents the Medical Technologies and Services segments key product lines: Key Product Lines Infection Prevention For the U.S. market, skin disinfectant and other patient preparation, hair removal and skin care products and infection detection software (sold under the ChloraPrep and MedMined brands); for international markets, all of the above products and also third party sourced surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products and custom surgical procedure kits Medical Specialties Surgical instruments and related products and services, interventional specialty products, such as diagnostic trays and biopsy needles, drainage catheters and vertebral augmentation products, and neurological monitoring and diagnostic products (surgical instruments sold under the V. Mueller brand) Infection Prevention Our infection prevention products consist mainly of single use medical products used in surgical and vascular access procedures. Many of these products enhance patient outcomes by reducing HAIs, such as surgical site infections and catheter related bloodstream infections. HAIs are a significant issue for hospitals around the world, and a recent cost estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, puts the economic impact of HAIs at approximately $20 billion per year in the United States alone. As of October 1, 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services no longer reimburse hospitals for the added cost of treating certain HAIs, placing an increased economic burden on hospitals. CDC estimates that over 30% of HAIs are related to routine occurrences in hospitals, such as central line catheter insertions, surgical site incisions and poor preparation for surgery. In our U.S. infection prevention business, our key product offering is our line of proprietary ChloraPrep sterile, single use applicators for patient preoperative skin preparation in vascular access and surgical procedures. ChloraPrep products are used by hospitals and surgery centers to disinfect the skin before surgical and vascular 11 Table of Contents procedures to help prevent blood stream and surgical site infections. We began to market the ChloraPrep products upon our acquisition of the assets of Enturia in fiscal 2008. ChloraPrep products use the clinically preferred concentration of the skin antiseptic chlorhexidine gluconate, or CHG, with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Due to the more than 35 clinical studies demonstrating the superiority of CHG to traditional iodine based products, over a dozen internationally recognized agencies and organizations, including the CDC, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, the National Institutes of Health, the American Association of Critical Care Nurses and the American Academy of Pediatrics, support the use of CHG based formulations for patient skin preparation. In addition to ChloraPrep products, we also manufacture and market a broad line of patient preparation, hair removal and skin care products, including clippers and razors, special soaps, sponges and scrub brushes for surgeons and other operating room personnel. While our direct selling organization primarily promotes our infection prevention products to acute care hospitals, our products are also used in ambulatory surgical centers and other healthcare settings such as bloodbanks, dialysis centers and home health and reference labs. In our international infection prevention business, we primarily sell third party sourced surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products and assemble and sell custom surgical procedure kits. The four key categories in these markets are: single use surgical drapes, gowns and apparel that provide barrier protection for patients, doctors and clinical staff during surgery, childbirth and other procedures; surgical gloves in both latex and latex free versions; fluid suction and collection systems that consist of disposable suction canisters and liners, suction tubing and supporting hardware and accessories; and surgical procedure kits that we custom assemble and often include the surgical drapes we sell. We have sales representatives or commissioned agents outside the United States. We have recently received regulatory approval in the United Kingdom to sell ChloraPrep products, and over time our intention is to use our direct selling organization outside the United States to bring ChloraPrep products to international markets. We also offer MedMined services that feature infection detection software for hospitals, alerting clinicians to early signs of an emerging infection issue and allowing the hospital to target improvement efforts at the right place and the right time. This patented program automatically identifies patterns indicative of specific and correctable quality breakdowns to prevent and treat HAIs. More than 300 hospitals in the United States use MedMined services to help them detect, monitor, prevent and measure outcomes related to HAIs. Medical Specialties Our V. Mueller brand is the largest U.S. supplier of reusable stainless steel surgical instruments primarily focused on the operating room. V. Mueller is an established brand that has been in business for over 100 years and today enables hospitals and surgeons to manage their surgical instruments to ensure the highest level of safety, productivity, quality and performance. We offer over 25,000 unique surgical instruments, as well as surgical instrument information tracking systems, surgical instrument sterilization container systems and surgical instrument repair services. Key products include clamps, needle holders, retractors, specialty scissors and forceps. Our V. Mueller products are sold predominantly in the United States directly to hospitals through a direct selling organization. Additionally, we develop and manufacture a variety of medical devices used primarily by interventional radiologists and surgeons in combination with certain image guidance technologies (for example, x ray, computed tomography and ultrasound). We offer an extensive line of products that support interventional medicine for a variety of clinical disciplines in body and spine pain interventions. Our products include 12 Table of Contents diagnostic trays, bone marrow and soft tissue biopsy needles to diagnose cancer, drainage catheters and vertebral augmentation products to treat painful fractures of the spine. These products are sold predominantly in the United States directly to hospitals. In addition to the products and services described above, we also develop, manufacture, market and service a comprehensive line of neurological, vascular and audiological diagnostic and monitoring products, as well as provide a complete line of accessories for these devices. We sell our neurocare products globally to a variety of customers, including hospitals and other healthcare facilities such as private practice and outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgery centers and physician offices. Competition The markets for our products are highly competitive. No one company competes with us across the breadth of our offerings, but individual product lines face significant competition in both our domestic and international markets. We compete based upon quality and reliability, technological innovation, price, customer service and support capabilities, brand recognition, patents and other intellectual property and the value proposition of helping improve patient outcomes while reducing overall costs associated with patient safety. We believe our superior product quality and brand strength give us a competitive advantage. We expect to continue to use our clinical expertise to offer innovative, industry leading products for our customers. Customers, Sales and Distribution Sales to customers in the United States accounted for approximately 76% of our fiscal 2009 revenue. Our primary end customers in the United States include hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, clinics, long term care facilities and physician offices. A substantial portion of our products in the United States are sold to hospitals that are members of a group purchasing organization, or GPO, and through wholesalers and distributors. Included within our products sales to wholesalers and distributors are product sales to Cardinal Health with whom we have a non exclusive distribution relationship following the spinoff. We have purchasing agreements for specified products with a wide range of GPOs in the United States. The scope of products included in these agreements varies by GPO. Sales to customers outside the United States comprised approximately 24% of fiscal 2009 revenue. Our products are sold in more than 120 countries worldwide. Our primary customers in markets outside the United States are hospitals and wholesalers. We serve these customers through a direct sales force with a presence in over 15 countries and a network of distributors. Our capital equipment products generally are delivered from our manufacturing facilities directly to the customer. Our disposables and other non capital equipment products generally are delivered from our manufacturing facilities and from third party manufacturers to warehouses and from there, the products are delivered to the customer. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products by road, rail, sea and air. Intellectual Property Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others. We hold numerous patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the United States and in other countries that relate to aspects of the technology used in many of our products. Our policy is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries when we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. 13 Table of Contents We own or have rights to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business. Some of the more important trademarks that we own or have rights to use that appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K include: CareFusiontm, Alaris&reg;, Guardrails&reg;, Pyxis&reg;, AVEA&reg;, Pulmonetic Systemstm, Jaeger&reg;, SensorMedics&reg;, ChloraPrep&reg;, V. Mueller&reg;, SmartSite&reg; , MedStation&reg;, PyxisConnect&reg;, Pyxis SupplyStationtm, Pyxis ProcedureStationtm, MedMinedtm, Convertors&reg;, Presource&reg;, CardinalASSISTtm, EnVetm and Valuelink&reg;, which may be registered or trademarked in the United States and other jurisdictions. Research and Development We continuously engage in research and development to introduce new products and enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of our existing products. Our research and development efforts include internal initiatives as well as collaborative development opportunities with third parties and licensing or acquiring technology from third parties. We employ engineers, software developers, clinicians and scientists in research and development worldwide. These experts enable us to create innovative, industry leading products and services because of their in depth understanding of the medical and clinical protocols for our product lines. Our research and development expenses were $165 million, $162 million and $103 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We evaluate developing technologies in areas where we have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition. We intend to continue our focus on research and development as a key strategy for growth. We intend to focus our internal and external investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. Quality Management We place significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to our customers. Quality management plays an essential role in understanding and meeting customer requirements, effectively resolving quality issues and improving our products and services. We have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of our products. To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable requirements, we regularly review our quality systems to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. We also perform assessments of our suppliers of raw materials, components and finished goods. In addition, we conduct quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of products and services. From time to time, we may determine that products manufactured or marketed by us do not meet our specifications, published standards or regulatory requirements. When a quality issue is identified, we investigate the issue and seek to take appropriate corrective action, such as withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of the product at the customer location, notice to the customer of revised labeling or other actions. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business. Regulatory Matters Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our medical device products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation. Most notably, all of our medical devices sold in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, as implemented and enforced by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. The FDA, and in some cases other government agencies, administer requirements covering the design, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution and post market surveillance of our products. 14 Table of Contents Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market must first receive either premarket notification clearance (by making a 510(k) submission) or premarket approval (by filing a premarket approval application, or PMA) from the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act. In addition, certain modifications made to marketed devices also may require 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. The FDAs 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months, but it can last longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will be obtained for any product that we propose to market. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements include the following: product listing and establishment registration; adherence to the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; labeling requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of off label uses or indications; adverse event reporting; post approval restrictions or conditions, including post approval study commitments; post market surveillance requirements; the FDAs recall authority, whereby it can ask for, or require, the recall of products from the market; and requirements relating to voluntary corrections or removals. Our manufacturing facilities, as well as those of certain of our suppliers, are subject to periodic and for cause inspections to verify compliance with the QSR as well as other regulatory requirements. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacturing and distributing products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made outside of the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business. Regulation of Medical Devices Outside of the United States Medical device laws also are in effect in many of the non U.S. markets in which we do business. These laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of device related adverse events, also are components of most of these regulatory systems. Most of our business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. For example, the European Commission, or EC, has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through European Medical Device Directives with which manufacturers must comply. Under these regulations, manufacturing plants must have received CE certification from a notified body in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the European Union. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a CE mark. Products covered by the EC regulations that do not bear the CE mark may not be sold or distributed within the European Union. Regulation of Drugs We market a line of topical antiseptics under the ChloraPrep brand name that are regulated by the FDA and comparable international authorities as nonprescription or over the counter, or OTC, drugs. Some of these products are marketed under a new drug application approved by the FDA or its international counterparts. OTC drugs are regulated in the same fashion as prescription drugs in that we must comply with good manufacturing practices, our manufacturing facilities (or those of our contract manufacturers) must be registered and the manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by federal and state authorities. Outside the United States, regulatory authorities regulate our OTC products in a manner similar to FDA. In the United States, advertising of OTC drugs is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, which imposes certain restrictions on our promotional activities for these products. If we (or our suppliers) fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, we could 15 Table of Contents face sanctions ranging from warning letters, product seizures, civil or criminal enforcement actions, consent decrees, or removal of the product from distribution. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business. Healthcare Laws We are subject to various federal, state and local laws in the United States targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, which generally prohibit us from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other government sponsored healthcare programs. Healthcare costs have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. The U.S. federal government continues to scrutinize potentially fraudulent practices affecting Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Payers have become more influential in the marketplace and increasingly are focused on drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of healthcare. Violations of fraud and abuse related laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Other Regulatory Requirements We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti bribery laws applicable in non U.S. jurisdictions that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In the sale, delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the United States, we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those administered by the Department of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, and the Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and or with certain individuals identified by the U.S. government. Despite our training and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Raw Materials We use a wide variety of resin, metals and electrical components for production of our products. We primarily purchase these materials from external suppliers, some of which are single source suppliers. We purchase materials from selected suppliers based on quality assurance, cost effectiveness and constraints resulting from regulatory requirements, and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Global commodity pricing can ultimately affect pricing of certain of these raw materials. Environmental Our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws. In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies administer laws that restrict the emission of pollutants into the air, discharges of pollutants into bodies of water and disposal of pollutants on the ground. Violations of these laws can result in significant civil and criminal penalties and incarceration. The failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental law and subject the owner and 16 Table of Contents operator to civil and criminal sanctions. Most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental law. U.S. laws also typically allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations. Outside the United States, the environmental laws and their enforcement vary and may be more burdensome. For example, some European countries impose environmental taxes or require manufacturers to take back used products at the end of their useful life, and others restrict the materials that manufacturers may use in their products and require redesign and labeling of products. Although such laws do not currently have a significant impact on our products, they are expanding rapidly in Europe. We have management programs and processes in place that are intended to minimize the potential for violations of these laws. Other environmental laws, primarily in the United States, address the contamination of land and groundwater and require the clean up of such contamination. These laws may apply not only to the owner or operator of an on going business, but also to the owner of land contaminated by a prior owner or operator. In addition, if a parcel is contaminated by the release of a hazardous substance, such as through its historic use as a disposal site, any person or company that has contributed to that contamination, whether or not it has a legal interest in the land, may be subject to a requirement to clean up the parcel. Employees At June 30, 2009, we employed over 15,000 people across our global operations, with approximately 6,900 employed in the United States. In Europe, some of our employees are represented by unions or works councils. Overall, we consider our employee relations to be good. Certain Corporate Governance and Other Information We maintain a Code of Conduct which applies to each member of our board of directors and to all of our employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. In addition, each committee of our board of directors is governed by a written charter. Our Code of Conduct and the governing charters of our boards Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee, and Human Resources and Compensation Committee can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website accessible to the public at www.carefusion.com; by clicking the Corporate Governance link. We will post any amendments to, or waivers from, our Code of Conduct at this location on our website. In addition to these documents, we post on our public website our Annual Report on Form 10 K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10 Q, Current Reports on Form 8 K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with , or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. These materials can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website by clicking the Financial Information link and then the SEC Filings link. Copies of any of these documents may be obtained free of charge through our website or by contacting our Investor Relations Department at 3750 Torrey View Court, San Diego, California, 92130, or by calling 1 888 876 4287. You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1 800 SEC 0330. The SEC also maintains an Internet site that contains our reports, proxy and information statements, and other information at www.sec.gov. In addition, in connection with our spinoff from Cardinal Health, we filed a registration statement on Form 10 (File No. 001 34273) with the SEC. You may obtain additional information regarding the spinoff by reviewing the registration statement. We have included the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules, relating to the quality of our public disclosure, in this Annual Report on Form 10 K as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. 17 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10 K in evaluating us and our common stock. Any of the following risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to our business, risks related to the separation and risks related to our common stock. Risks Related to Our Business We may be unable to effectively enhance our existing products or introduce and market new products or may fail to keep pace with advances in technology. The healthcare industry is characterized by evolving technologies and industry standards, frequent new product introductions, significant competition and dynamic customer requirements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive. As a result, our position in the industry could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products, as well as the pricing models for such products. The success of our business depends on our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products and adapt to these changing technologies and customer requirements. The success of new product development depends on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory approvals and clearances on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in a cost effective and timely manner, maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. To compete successfully in the marketplace, we must make substantial investments in new product development whether internally or externally through licensing, acquisitions or joint development agreements. Our failure to enhance our existing products or introduce new and innovative products in a timely manner would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are able to develop, manufacture and obtain regulatory approvals and clearances for our new products, the success of those products would depend upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for our new products could be affected by several factors, including: the availability of alternative products from our competitors; the price and reliability of our products relative to that of our competitors; the timing of our market entry; and our ability to market and distribute our products effectively. We are subject to complex and costly regulation. Our products are subject to regulation by the FDA, and other national, supranational, federal and state governmental authorities. It can be costly and time consuming to obtain regulatory clearance and or approval to market a medical device or other product. Clearance and or approval might not be granted for a new or modified device or other product on a timely basis, if at all. Regulations are subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales. In addition, we are subject to regulations covering manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and adverse event reporting that apply after we have obtained clearance or approval to sell a product. Our failure to maintain clearances or approvals for existing products, to obtain clearance or approval for new or modified products, or to adhere to regulations for manufacturing, labeling, advertising or adverse event reporting could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, if we determine a product manufactured or marketed by us does not meet our specifications, published standards or regulatory requirements, we may seek to correct the product or withdraw the product from the market, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to ongoing oversight, including periodic inspection by governmental authorities. Compliance with production, safety, quality control and quality assurance regulations can be costly and time consuming. 18 Table of Contents Cost containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups, third party payers and governmental organizations could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Many existing and potential customers for our products within the United States have become members of GPOs, and integrated delivery networks, or IDNs, in an effort to reduce costs. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. Due to the highly competitive nature of the GPO and IDN contracting processes, we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs across our product portfolio. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our profitability. While having a contract with a GPO or IDN can facilitate sales to members of that GPO or IDN, it is no assurance that sales volume of those products will be maintained. The members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors, which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability. In addition, our capital equipment products typically represent a sizeable initial capital expenditure for healthcare organizations. Changes in the budgets of these organizations and the timing of spending under these budgets and conflicting spending priorities can have a significant effect on the demand for our capital equipment products and related services. Any decrease in expenditures by these healthcare facilities could decrease demand for our capital equipment products and related services and reduce our revenue. Distributors of our products may begin to negotiate terms of sale more aggressively in an effort to increase their profitability. Failure to negotiate distribution arrangements having advantageous pricing or other terms of sale could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to implement distribution arrangements successfully, it could cause us to lose market share to our competitors. Outside the United States, we have experienced downward pricing pressure due to the concentration of purchasing power in centralized governmental healthcare authorities and increased efforts by such authorities to lower healthcare costs. Our failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could adversely affect our sales and profitability in these markets. Declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the financial markets and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the United States and other parts of the world could adversely impact our customers and vendors in a number of ways, which could adversely affect us. Recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause vendors to reduce their output or change terms of sales. We have observed certain hospitals delaying capital equipment purchase decisions, which we expect will have an adverse impact on our financial results through the middle of calendar year 2010. If customers cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us. Likewise, for similar reasons, vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms. We also extend credit through an equipment leasing program for a substantial portion of sales to our dispensing product customers. We are subject to the risk that if these customers fail to pay or delay payment for the dispensing products they purchase from us, it could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, defaults exceeding our expectations and an adverse impact on the cost or availability of financing. These risks related to our equipment leasing program may be exacerbated by a variety of factors, including declining economic conditions, decreases in demand for our dispensing products and negative trends in the businesses of our leasing customers. 19 Table of Contents Any inability of current and or potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. There can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. In addition, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the United States, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue. We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation is costly to defend and can result in significant damage awards, including treble damages under certain circumstances, and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products. At any given time, we are involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. We can expect to face additional claims of patent infringement in the future. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Defects or failures associated with our products and or our quality system could lead to the filing of adverse event reports, recalls or safety alerts and negative publicity and could subject us to regulatory actions. Manufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, off label uses or inadequate disclosure of product related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. These problems could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products and result in significant costs and negative publicity. Due to the strong name recognition of our brands, an adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. In some circumstances, adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals or clearances. We may also voluntarily undertake a recall of our products or temporarily shut down production lines based on internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data. Our future operating results will depend on our ability to sustain an effective quality control system, and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to our quality system. Our quality system plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects and improving our products and services. While we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in public warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacturing and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made 20 Table of Contents outside the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. Any of the foregoing events could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are currently operating under a consent decree with the FDA and our failure to comply with the requirements of the consent decree may have an adverse effect on our business. Since February 2007, we have been subject to a consent decree with the FDA relating to our Alaris SE pumps, which alleges that such pumps did not meet the standards of the FDC Act. In February 2009, we and the FDA amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for our subsidiary that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the United States. Without admitting the allegations contained in the amended consent decree, and in addition to the requirements of the original consent decree, we agreed, among other things, to submit a corrective action plan to the FDA to bring the Alaris system and all other infusion pumps in use in the U.S. market into compliance with the FDC Act, have our infusion pump facilities inspected by an independent expert, and have our recall procedures and all ongoing recalls involving our infusion pumps inspected by an independent recall expert, all of which have now occurred. On June 2, 2009, the FDA notified us that the corrective action plan was acceptable and that we should begin implementation of the plan. We recorded a reserve of $18 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 related to the corrective action plan. We may be obligated to pay more or less than the amount that we reserved in connection with the amended consent decree and our corrective action plan because, among other things, the cost of implementing the corrective action plan may be different than our current expectations (including as a result of changes in manufacturing, delivery and material costs), the FDA may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree or our corrective action plan and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree, and or we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree. Moreover, the matters addressed in the amended consent decree could lead to negative publicity that could have an adverse impact on our business. For several months of fiscal 2009, we also placed a hold on shipping the Alaris PCA module and related Alaris PC Unit while we sought FDA clearance for a software correction under the corrective action plan. We received the required clearance in July 2009, and we subsequently resumed shipments. The amended consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing, recall products and take other actions. We may also be required to pay monetary damages if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree. See note 11 to the audited combined financial statements for more detail. Any of the foregoing matters could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur product liability losses and other litigation liability. We are, and may be in the future, subject to product liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions, alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could be costly to defend and could result in settlement payments and adjustments not covered by or in excess of insurance. In addition, we may not be able to obtain insurance on terms acceptable to us or at all because insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain. Our failure to successfully defend against product liability claims or maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, certain of which are discussed in note 11 to the audited combined financial statements. All such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business, or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. Future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations. In some cases, substantial non economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. 21 Table of Contents We rely on the performance of our information technology systems, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business and performance. Our business requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. These systems are vulnerable to interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction and other events, which are beyond our control. Systems interruptions could reduce our ability to manufacture and provide service for our products, and could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. The level of protection and disaster recovery capability varies from site to site, and there can be no guarantee that any such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be totally effective. An interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, an inability to obtain key components or raw materials or an increase in the cost of key components or raw materials may adversely affect our business. Many of our key products are manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of our facilities, it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. In addition, for reasons of quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase certain components and raw materials from sole suppliers. We may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components that are acceptable to us, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment efforts of our customers and third party payers, we may be unable to pass along cost increases for key components or raw materials through higher prices to our customers. If the cost of key components or raw materials increases and we are unable fully to recover these increased costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability. We may not be successful in our strategic acquisitions of, investments in, or joint development agreements with, other companies and businesses. We may pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technology licensing arrangements and joint development agreements to expand our product offerings and geographic presence as part of our business strategy. We may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition, license arrangement or joint development agreement. Other companies may compete with us for these strategic opportunities. Even if we are successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that we acquire may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than we originally anticipated. We also could experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges, and other issues that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of the acquired company, including issues related to internal control over financial reporting, regulatory or compliance issues that could exist for an acquired company or business and potential adverse short term effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could cause a deterioration of our credit profile and or rating and result in reduced availability of credit to us or in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. We could experience difficulties in integrating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities, and personnel with diverse backgrounds. Integration of an acquired business also may require management resources that otherwise would be available for development of our existing business. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 22 Table of Contents We may face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. We anticipate that the current presidential administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. Public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future. The uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation may, while such uncertainties remain unresolved, have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and services. At this time, we cannot predict which, if any, healthcare reform proposals will be adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us. We may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing stockholders. We intend to increase our investment in research and development activities and expand our sales and marketing activities. We also may make acquisitions. Our ability to take these and other actions may be limited by our available liquidity, including our ability to access our foreign cash balances in a tax efficient manner. As a consequence, in the future, we may need to seek additional financing. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we lose an investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants. Additionally, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Recent disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions and reduced lending activity, may adversely affect the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future. There can be no assurance that recent government initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to us. We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non U.S. laws, regulations and customs. Sales to customers outside of the United States made up approximately 24% of our revenue in fiscal year 2009 and we expect that non U.S. sales will contribute to future growth. The risks associated with our operations outside the United States include: changes in non U.S. government programs; multiple non U.S. regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products; possible failure to comply with anti bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions; different local product preferences and product requirements; possible failure to comply with trade protection and restriction measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non U.S. operations; different labor regulations; 23 Table of Contents changes in environmental, health and safety laws; potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures; minimal or diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and regulatory changes that may place our products at a disadvantage. These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries such as the Euro, where we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Additionally, we incur significant costs in foreign currencies and a fluctuation in those currencies value can negatively impact manufacturing and selling costs. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws and regulations are wide ranging and subject to changing interpretation and application, which could restrict our sales or marketing practices. Furthermore, since many of our customers rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures, our exclusion from such programs as a result of a violation of these laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. See note 10 to the audited combined financial statements for a discussion of Notices of Proposed Adjustment received during fiscal year 2008. Our reserves against disputed tax obligations may ultimately prove to be insufficient. The IRS currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2007 for Cardinal Health. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, Cardinal Health received an IRS Revenue Agents Report for the tax years 2003 through 2005 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in these notices totals $462 million, excluding penalties and interest, which may be significant. We and Cardinal Health disagree with the IRS regarding the application of the U.S. Treasury regulations to the arrangements under review and the valuations underlying such adjustments and intend to 24 Table of Contents vigorously contest them. Although we believe that we have provided an appropriate contingent tax reserve for these matters under FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN No. 48), we may not be fully reserved for this matter and it is possible that we may be obligated to pay an amount in excess of the reserve, including the full amount that the IRS is seeking. The tax matters agreement that we entered into with Cardinal Health specifies that this matter, including the control of audit proceedings and payment of any additional liability, is our responsibility. Any such obligation could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See note 10 to the audited combined financial statements for a discussion of Notices of Proposed Adjustment received during fiscal 2009. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations. On July 1, 2009, we entered into two senior revolving credit facilities with an aggregate principal amount of $720 million. In addition, on July 14, 2009, we offered and sold $1.4 billion of senior unsecured notes that were utilized to finance our separation from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009. This significant amount of debt could have important consequences to us and our investors, including: requiring a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt; making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations; increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt as we are; and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt. In addition we may drawdown our revolving credit facilities, which would have the effect of increasing our indebtedness. As a result of various restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our senior revolving credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes, our financial flexibility will be restricted in a number of ways. The agreements governing the senior revolving credit facilities subject us and our subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, make distributions, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments and investments, consummate certain asset sales, enter into transactions with affiliates, conduct businesses other than our current or related businesses, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Our senior revolving credit facilities also require us to meet certain financial ratio tests on an ongoing basis that may require us to take action and reduce debt or act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests. We cannot assure you that we will meet those tests or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior revolving credit facilities. If an event of default under our senior revolving credit facilities or senior notes occurs, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. 25 Table of Contents Risks Related to the Separation We have no operating history as a separate public company, and our financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results. The audited combined financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K do not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors: prior to the separation, our business was operated by Cardinal Health as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Cardinal Health or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, including, but not limited to, legal, treasury, accounting, auditing, risk management, information technology, human resources, corporate affairs, tax administration, certain governance functions (including compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and internal audit) and external reporting. Our financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Cardinal Health for these and similar functions. These allocations are likely to be less than the comparable expenses we believe we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company; up until the separation, our business was integrated with the other businesses of Cardinal Health. Historically, we have shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. While we have entered into transition agreements that will govern certain commercial and other relationships among us and Cardinal Health after the separation, those transitional arrangements may not fully capture the benefits our businesses have enjoyed as a result of being integrated with the other businesses of Cardinal Health. The loss of these benefits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition following the completion of the separation; and generally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, research and development and capital expenditures, have historically been satisfied as part of the corporate wide cash management policies of Cardinal Health. Following the completion of the separation we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements. Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Cardinal Health. If there is a determination that the separation is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the IRS ruling or tax opinions are incorrect or for any other reason, then Cardinal Health and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities and we could incur significant liabilities. In connection with the separation, Cardinal Health received a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the contribution and the distribution qualified as a transaction that is tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In addition, Cardinal Health received opinions of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, co counsel to Cardinal Health, to the effect that the contribution and the distribution qualified as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The ruling and opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Cardinal Health and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Cardinal Health and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be 26 Table of Contents subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct, have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of Cardinal Health or us after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Cardinal Health and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities and we could incur significant liabilities. We may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions after the separation. To preserve the tax free treatment to Cardinal Health of the contribution and the distribution, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Cardinal Health, we are restricted from taking any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions, including use of our common stock to make acquisitions and equity capital market transactions, which might increase the value of our business. The retention by Cardinal Health of shares of our common stock may further exacerbate these restrictions. Certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their former positions in Cardinal Health. The ownership by some of our executive officers and some of our directors of common shares, options, or other equity awards of Cardinal Health may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest. Because of their former positions with Cardinal Health, certain of our executive officers and non employee directors own common shares of Cardinal Health, options to purchase common shares of Cardinal Health or other equity awards. The individual holdings of common shares, options to purchase common shares of Cardinal Health or other equity awards may be significant for some of these persons compared to these persons total assets. Even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, and our executive officers ceased to be employees of Cardinal Health upon the separation, ownership by our directors and officers of common shares or options to purchase common shares of Cardinal Health, or any other equity awards, creates, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Cardinal Health than the decisions have for us. We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, and the separation may adversely affect our business. We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. These benefits include the following: improving strategic planning, increasing management focus and streamlining decision making by providing us the flexibility to implement our unique strategic plans and to respond more effectively to our customer needs and the changing economic environment; allowing us to adopt the capital structure, investment policy and dividend policy best suited to our financial profile and business needs, as well as resolving the current competition for capital among Cardinal Health and its investors; and facilitating incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of our business, and enhancing employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives, while at the same time creating an independent equity structure that will facilitate our ability to effect future acquisitions utilizing our common stock. 27 Table of Contents We may not achieve the anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons. There also can be no assurance that the separation will not adversely affect our business. Cardinal Health may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire. In connection with the separation, we and Cardinal Health entered into various agreements, including a separation agreement, a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, intellectual property agreements and commercial agreements. The separation agreement, the tax matters agreement and employee matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and will include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The transition services agreement provided for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation. We will rely on Cardinal Health to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Cardinal Health is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once certain transaction agreements expire, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services Cardinal Health currently provides to us. We may not be successful in implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from Cardinal Healths systems to ours. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Future sales or distributions of our common stock could depress the market price for shares of our common stock. As of September 8, 2009, we had approximately 221.2 million shares of common stock outstanding, excluding 40 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our long term incentive plan. As a result of the separation, Cardinal Health distributed approximately 179.8 million shares of our common stock to its shareholders, all of which are freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless held by Cardinal Health or our affiliates as that term is defined by the federal securities laws. Although we have no knowledge of any plan or intention on the part of any Cardinal Health shareholder to sell our common stock following the separation, it is possible that some Cardinal Health shareholders, including possibly some of its largest shareholders, may sell our common stock received in the distribution for reasons such as that our business profile or market capitalization as a separate, publicly traded company does not fit their investment objectives. In addition, after completion of the separation, Cardinal Health retained approximately 19% of our total shares outstanding or approximately 41.4 million shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the private letter ruling from the IRS, Cardinal Health is required to dispose of such shares of our common stock that it owns as soon as practicable and consistent with its reasons for retaining such shares, but in no event later than five years after the distribution. We have agreed that, upon the request of Cardinal Health, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to effect a registration under applicable federal and state securities laws of any shares of our common stock retained by Cardinal Health. Any disposition by Cardinal Health, or any significant Cardinal Health shareholder, of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. Your percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future. As with any publicly traded company, your percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees. 28 Table of Contents Following the separation our stock price may fluctuate significantly. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; and domestic and foreign economic conditions. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by laws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting; rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; the right of our board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; the division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three year term; a provision that stockholders may only remove directors with cause; the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and the requirement that stockholders holding at least eighty percent of our voting stock are required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws relating to the number, term and election of our directors, the filling of board vacancies, stockholder notice procedures and the calling of special meetings of stockholders. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our principal executive offices are located in an owned facility in San Diego, California. At June 30, 2009, we owned or leased a total of approximately 3.4 million square feet of facility space worldwide to handle manufacturing, production, assembly, research, quality assurance testing, distribution, packaging, and administrative functions. At June 30, 2009, we had 20 manufacturing facilities of which 11 were located in the United States. We consider our operating facilities to be well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted in them. We periodically evaluate our operating properties, however, and we may make additions, improvements and consolidations, when appropriate. None of our facilities experienced any significant idle time during fiscal year 2009.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol CFN. A when issued trading market for our common stock began on the NYSE on August 21, 2009, and regular way trading of our common stock began on September 1, 2009. Prior to August 21, 2009 there was no public market for our common stock. From September 1, 2009 through September 8, 2009, the highest sales price for our common stock on the NYSE was $19.95 per share, and the lowest sales price for our common stock on the NYSE was $18.31 per share. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated since the spinoff and is likely to continue to fluctuate. On September 8, 2009, there were 14,684 stockholders of record and 221,234,601 outstanding shares. Dividends We currently intend to retain any earnings to finance research and development, acquisitions and the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any dividends in the future by us will be subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Moreover, if we determine to pay any dividends in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends. ITEM 6.

Introduction Managements discussion and analysis, which we refer to as MD&A, of our results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to the audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. MD&A is organized as follows: Separation from Cardinal Health, Inc. This section provides an overview of the decision to separate CareFusion from Cardinal Health. Overview This section provides a general description of our business. Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations This section includes key issues, factors and trends that may have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial conditions. Principles of Combination and Basis of Presentation This section describes the major principles used to prepare the financial statements, including the allocation methodology and adjustments made to present our combined financial statements. Combined Results of Operations This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007. Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates This section describes the accounting policies and estimates that we consider most important for our business and that require significant judgment. Separation from Cardinal Health, Inc. On September 29, 2008, Cardinal Health announced that it intended to separate its clinical and medical products businesses from the remainder of its businesses through a pro rata distribution of the common stock of an entity holding the assets and liabilities associated with the clinical and medical products businesses. CareFusion Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 2009 for the purpose of holding such businesses. We completed the spinoff from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health contributed the majority of the businesses comprising its clinical and medical products segment to us (the contribution), and distributed approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 179.8 million shares, to its shareholders (the distribution), based on a distribution ration of 0.5 shares of our common stock for each common share of Cardinal Health held on the record date of August 25, 2009. Cardinal Health retained approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 41.4 million shares, in connection with the spinoff. As a condition to the separation, Cardinal Health is required to dispose of the remaining 19% of our common stock within five years of the distribution date. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health retained certain lines of business that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the U.S. markets that were historically managed by us prior to the 33 Table of Contents spinoff, which were part of the clinical and medical products businesses of Cardinal Health. These lines of businesses are reflected in the CareFusion financial information, primarily in the medical technologies and services segment. This MD&A is written based on the fact that these businesses are incorporated within CareFusions financial position, results of operations and cash flows on an as managed basis. Going forward, starting with our Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, these businesses will be presented within our financial statements as discontinued operations as of the spinoff date of August 31, 2009. In connection with the separation and other restructuring activities not related to the separation, we expect to incur one time expenditures of between approximately $120 million to $130 million in fiscal 2010. These expenditures primarily consist of employee related costs, costs to start up certain stand alone functions and information technology systems and other one time transaction related costs. Also included are approximately $21 million of capitalized fees associated with our bridge loan facility that were expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to the termination of that agreement on August 31, 2009. We expect to fund these costs through cash from operations, cash on hand and, if necessary, cash available from our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities. A portion of these expenditures will be capitalized and amortized over their useful lives and others will be expensed as incurred, depending on their nature. Additionally, we will incur increased costs as an independent, publicly traded company, primarily as a result of higher charges than in the past from Cardinal Health for transition services and from establishing or expanding the corporate support for our businesses, including information technology, human resources, treasury, tax, risk management, accounting and financial reporting, investor relations, legal, procurement and other services. In the first year following the separation, these annual operating costs are estimated to be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher than the general corporate expenses we reported historically as being allocated to us from Cardinal Health. We believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these additional corporate expenses. We do not anticipate that increased costs solely from becoming an independent, publicly traded company will have an adverse effect on our growth rate in the future beyond fiscal 2010. We believe that the separation will allow us to: improve strategic planning, increase management focus and streamline decision making by providing us the flexibility to implement our unique strategic plans and to respond more effectively to our customer needs and the changing economic environment; allow us to adopt the capital structure, investment policy and dividend policy best suited to our financial profile and business needs, as well as resolve the current competition for capital among Cardinal Health and its investors; and facilitate incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of our business, and enhance employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives, while at the same time creating an independent equity structure that will facilitate our ability to effect future acquisitions utilizing our common stock. create a base of shareholders interested in Medical Technologies. Overview We are a global medical technology company with clinically proven and industry leading products and services designed to measurably improve the safety and quality of healthcare. We offer comprehensive product lines in the areas of IV infusion, medication and supply dispensing, respiratory care, infection prevention and surgical instruments. Our offerings include established brands used in hospitals throughout the United States and in more than 120 countries worldwide. Our primary product brands include: Alaris, Pyxis, AVEA, Pulmonetic Systems, Jaeger, SensorMedics, ChloraPrep and V. Mueller. 34 Table of Contents Our primary customers in the United States include hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, clinics, long term care facilities and physician offices. For both the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, we generated revenue of $4.5 billion, and net income of $568 million for fiscal 2009 and $663 million for fiscal 2008. Approximately, 76% of our fiscal 2009 revenue was from customers in the United States and 24% was from customers outside of the United States. In fiscal 2009, we introduced 17 new or enhanced products, and our innovation pipeline includes numerous additional new or enhanced products that are expected to be launched over the next 18 months. Our strategy is to enhance growth by focusing on healthcare safety and productivity, driving innovation and clinical differentiation, accelerating our global growth and pursuing strategic opportunities. Our business consists of two reporting segments: Critical Care Technologies and Medical Technologies and Services. Critical Care Technologies includes our infusion, dispensing and respiratory care businesses that develop, manufacture and sell capital equipment and related dedicated and non dedicated disposables. Medical Technologies and Services includes our infection prevention and medical specialties products and services businesses that develop, manufacture and sell primarily single use, disposable products and reusable surgical instruments. Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations The Overall Global Economic Environment, Industry Growth and Trends Healthcare related industries are generally less susceptible than some other industries to fluctuations in the overall economic environment. However, some of our businesses rely on capital spending from our customers (primarily hospitals), which spending can be influenced by a variety of economic factors, including interest rates, access to financing and endowment fluctuations. Significant changes in these economic factors can affect the sales of our capital equipment products, such as infusion pumps, dispensing equipment and ventilators. Additionally, sales volumes for some of our businesses are dependent on hospital admissions. Changes in admissions due to difficult economic times can affect our results for surgical and single use products, such as infusion and respiratory disposable sets, surgical instruments and infection prevention products. Since the beginning of fiscal 2009, we have observed certain hospitals delaying capital equipment purchase decisions, which had an adverse impact on our financial results for fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and which we expect will have an adverse impact on our financial results through the middle of calendar year 2010. Moreover, while global healthcare expenditures are projected to grow over the coming years, reimbursement and funding for these expenditures is declining. These factors are creating both pressure and opportunity in the marketplace. Primarily in response to the delay in hospital capital spending and the overall decline in the global economy, we implemented global workforce reduction in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, which will reduce our workforce by approximately 800 people over a six month period, and eliminate an additional 500 positions through normal attrition and by not filling open roles. In addition, we have implemented cost control measures and additional reductions in discretionary spending. We recorded a $19 million pre tax restructuring charge for fiscal 2009 associated with these actions, and anticipate an additional $14 million pre tax restructuring charge for fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010 and beyond, we expect to see a benefit within our operating income due to reduced expenses as a result of these cost reduction initiatives. In addition to the factors discussed above, we also anticipate that the current presidential administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. The uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation may, while such uncertainties remain unresolved, have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and services. At this time we cannot predict which, if any, healthcare reform proposals will be adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us. 35 Table of Contents Innovation and New Products Our business strategy relies significantly on innovation to develop and introduce new products and to differentiate our products from our competitors. Our investment expense in research and development increased $3 million from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. Looking forward, we expect our research and development expenditures to further increase at a higher rate as we make additional investments to support our growth strategies. We plan to increase our research and development expenditures with internal initiatives, as well as licensing or acquiring technology from third parties. Our internal and external investments will be focused on initiatives that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. With a significant investment in research and development, a strong focus on innovation and a well managed innovation process, we believe we can continue to innovate and grow. If, however, our future innovations are not successful in meeting customers needs or prove to be too costly versus their perceived benefit, our growth may slow. Competition We operate in highly competitive markets. Our success depends on, among other things, establishing and maintaining strong customer relationships, brand recognition and technological and functional advantage for our products, particularly in our capital equipment businesses. If we fail to maintain a strong competitive position, then customers may choose not to buy our products or we may be forced to discount our products to maintain market share. International and Foreign Exchange We sell our products in more than 120 countries and manufacture our products in nine countries in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Due to the global nature of our business, our revenue and expenses are influenced by foreign exchange movements. In fiscal 2009, approximately 23% of our sales were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies will affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars. The percentage of fiscal 2009 sales by major currencies was as follows: U.S. Dollar 77.0 % Euro 11.5 % British Pound 3.6 % All Other 7.9 % 100.0 % Product Quality and Recalls Product quality, particularly in life saving and sustaining technologies, plays a critical role in our success. A quality or safety issue may result in public warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made outside the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. Any of the foregoing events could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, recalls may negatively affect sales due to customer concerns about product quality. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our results were negatively affected by net charges for the cost of product recalls of $21 million, $18 million and $14 million, respectively. We are currently operating 36 Table of Contents our infusion business under a consent decree from the FDA, which was entered into in fiscal 2007 to resolve seizure litigation over Alaris SE pumps and amended in fiscal 2009 to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for our subsidiary that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the United States. On April 24, 2009, we submitted the corrective action plan required by the amended consent decree to the FDA. Included in the corrective action plan was, among other proposed corrective actions, a software correction that addresses a potential risk identified with the Alaris PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) module when used with the Alaris PC Unit operating with software versions 8 through 9.1. When the products are used together, the Alaris PCA module may infuse above or below the intended infusion dose if a specific sequence of events occurs. We recorded a reserve of $18 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 for the Alaris System, based on our estimate of the costs that will be incurred in connection with the corrective action plan. On June 2, 2009, the FDA notified us that the corrective action plan was acceptable and that we should begin implementation of the plan. We had placed a hold on shipping the Alaris PCA module and related Alaris PC Unit pending 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the software correction. We received 510(k) clearance on July 9, 2009 and have since resumed shipments. In response to infusion product recalls and the consent decree, we have made substantial investments in quality systems and quality personnel headcount over the past several years. While we believe that we have made significant improvements to our product quality and overall quality systems, further quality concerns, whether real or perceived, could adversely affect our results. Conversely, improving quality can be a competitive advantage and improve our results. Income Taxes Our operations have historically been included in Cardinal Healths U.S. federal and state tax returns or non U.S. jurisdictions tax returns. Prior to the separation, we and Cardinal Health entered into a tax matters agreement that governs the parties respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes. The IRS currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2007. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, Cardinal Health received an IRS Revenue Agents Report for the tax years 2003 through 2005 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in these notices totals $462 million, excluding penalties and interest, which may be significant. We and Cardinal Health disagree with the IRS regarding its application of the U.S. Treasury regulations to the arrangements under review and the valuations underlying such adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them. We believe that we have provided adequate contingent tax reserves for these matters under FIN No. 48. The tax matters agreement specifies that this matter, including the control of audit proceedings and payment of any additional liability, is our responsibility. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was 21%. However, certain of the businesses included in our combined financial statements that have a significant favorable foreign tax rate compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate were retained by Cardinal Health in the spinoff. In addition, there is an unfavorable impact on our effective state income tax rate as a result of the spinoff. We expect that our effective tax rate after the spinoff will be higher than what is included in our historical combined financial statements. Acquisitions Acquisitions have historically played a significant role in our growth. Significant acquisitions made in the last five years include VIASYS Healthcare Inc., or Viasys, and the assets of Enturia, Inc., or Enturia. While we believe that the integration of these acquisitions has generally been successful, our failure to complete or integrate future acquisitions successfully might negatively affect our results. For further information regarding acquisitions, see Combined Results of Operations below and note 2 to the audited combined financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Principles of Combination and Basis of Presentation Our combined financial statements presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and discussed below, have been prepared on a stand alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cardinal Health. The combined financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as we were historically managed, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Included within our combined financial statements are the results of certain businesses which have historically been managed by us but that were retained by Cardinal Health in the spinoff. Our fiscal year ends on June 30. All significant intra company transactions and accounts have been eliminated. All significant intercompany transactions between us and Cardinal Health have been included in these combined financial statements and are considered to be effectively settled for cash in the combined financial statements at the time the transaction is recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions is reflected in the combined statements of cash flow as a financing activity and in the combined balance sheets as Parent Company Investment. Our combined financial statements include expenses of Cardinal Health allocated to us for certain functions provided by Cardinal Health, including, but not limited to, general corporate expenses related to finance, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, ethics and compliance, shared services, employee benefits and incentives, insurance and stock based compensation. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, Cardinal Health allocated to us general corporate expenses of $406 million, $407 million and $428 million, respectively. These expenses have been allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of revenue, headcount or other measures. Both we and Cardinal Health consider the basis on which the expenses have been allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the services provided to or the benefit received by us during the periods presented. The allocations may not, however, reflect the expense we would have incurred as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if we had been a stand alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, what functions were outsourced or performed by employees, and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. Following the separation, we will perform these functions using our own resources or purchased services. For an interim period, however, some of these functions will continue to be provided by Cardinal Health under the transition services agreement. In addition to the transition services agreement, we entered into a number of commercial agreements with Cardinal Health in connection with the separation, many of which have terms longer than one year. Cardinal Health uses a centralized approach to U.S. domestic cash management and financing of its operations, excluding debt directly incurred by any of its businesses, such as debt assumed in an acquisition or certain capital lease obligations. The majority of our domestic cash was transferred to Cardinal Health daily and Cardinal Health funded our operating and investing activities as needed. A portion of Cardinal Healths consolidated debt has been allocated to us based on the debt levels consistent with an investment grade credit rating, including amounts directly incurred. Cardinal Healths historical long term debt balances were allocated to us based on a debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, leverage ratio, which, based on discussions with external advisors and comparisons with BBB rated companies in the S&P 500, is consistent with an investment grade credit rating. This allocation methodology is also generally consistent with managements long term capital structure plans for CareFusion as a separate, stand alone company. In contrast, short term debt balances (e.g., commercial paper, bank loans) held at the corporate level were not allocated down to CareFusion as this debt was issued to fund the operations of the Cardinal Health healthcare supply chain services businesses. As both CareFusion and Cardinal Health have established post spin capital structures that support investment grade credit ratings, we believe that utilizing financial metric targets to allocate historical third party debt is reasonable and appropriate. Cardinal Health debt allocated as of June 30, 2009 and 2008 was $1,281 million and $1,597 million, respectively. Net interest expense has been allocated in the same proportions as debt and includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. For fiscal years 38 Table of Contents 2009, 2008 and 2007, Cardinal Health has allocated to us net interest expense of $80 million, $88 million and $72 million, respectively. Cash transfers to and from Cardinal Healths U.S. domestic cash management accounts are reflected in Parent Company Investment in the combined balance sheets. We believe that the allocation basis for debt and net interest expense is reasonable based on the debt levels consistent with maintaining an investment grade credit rating for us. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. During fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, Cardinal Health paid royalties to us under various royalty agreements. During fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, we earned royalty income from Cardinal Health of $233 million, $189 million and $208 million, respectively. As a result of the separation, we no longer receive royalty income from these agreements, as the intellectual property underlying the royalty income remained with Cardinal Health. The combined financial statements also include the push down of certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Cardinal Health corporate level but which are specifically identifiable or otherwise allocable to us. The cash and cash equivalents held by Cardinal Health at the corporate level were not allocated to us for any of the periods presented. Cash and equivalents in our combined balance sheets primarily represent cash held locally by international entities included in our combined financial statements. Transfers of cash to and from Cardinal Healths domestic cash management system are reflected as a component of Parent Company Investment on the combined balance sheets. Cardinal Health maintains self insurance programs at a corporate level. We were allocated a portion of expenses associated with these programs as part of the general corporate overhead expenses. We were not allocated any portion of the related reserves as these reserves represent obligations of Cardinal Health which are not transferable. See note 1 to the audited combined financial statements for additional detail regarding the push down of assets and liabilities, including certain prepaid expenses, property and equipment and employee compensation liabilities. Our combined financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented. See note 14 to the audited combined financial statements for further description of the transactions between Cardinal Health and us. Combined Results of Operations The following table presents, for the periods indicated, selected items from our combined financial statements: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, Change (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs.2008 2008 vs.2007 Revenue $ 4,501 $ 4,518 $ 3,478 % 30 % Gross Margin 1,982 2,046 1,567 (3 )% 31 % Gross Margin Percentage 44.0 % 45.3 % 45.1 % Operating Income 589 725 465 (19 )% 56 % Provision for Income Taxes 151 184 116 (18 )% 59 % Effective Tax Rate 21.0 % 21.8 % 18.8 % Net Income $ 568 $ 663 $ 502 (14 )% 32 % 39 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2008 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, % of Revenue (in millions) 2009 2008 Change 2009 2008 Revenue $ 4,501 $ 4,518 % Cost of Products Sold 2,519 2,472 2 % 56 % 55 % Gross Margin 1,982 2,046 (3 )% 44 % 45 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 1,155 1,104 5 % 26 % 24 % Research and Development Expenses 165 162 2 % 4 % 4 % Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 73 37 97 % 2 % 1 % Acquired In Process Research and Development 18 (100 )% % % Operating Income 589 725 (19 )% 13 % 16 % Interest Expense and Other, Net (Including Net Interest Expense Allocated from Parent of $80 and $88 for Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, respectively) 103 67 54 % 2 % 1 % Royalty (Income) and Other, Net Received from Parent (233 ) (189 ) 23 % (5 )% (4 )% Income Before Income Taxes 719 847 (15 )% 16 % 19 % Provision for Income Taxes 151 184 (18 )% 3 % 4 % Net Income $ 568 $ 663 (14 )% 13 % 15 % Revenue Total revenue decreased slightly by $17 million to $4,501 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue decline resulted from lower sales volume in our capital equipment businesses ($149 million), as a result of the deferral of capital spending by hospitals and a ship hold on our Alaris infusion devices. Hospitals delayed their capital spending during fiscal 2009 due to the decline in the overall global economic environment, which we believe created uncertainty in regards to access to capital markets and reduced the size of hospital endowments that are utilized to provide funding for capital equipment products. For several months of fiscal 2009, we also placed a hold on shipping the Alaris PCA module and related Alaris PC Unit while we sought FDA clearance for a software correction under the corrective action plan, which we receive in July 2009. As a result of these items, the volume of our capital equipment sales decreased, and overall capital goods products revenues decreased ($149 million). Additionally, revenue declined due to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($118 million) and divestitures ($17 million). Sales transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar comprised approximately 23% and 28% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which the majority is denominated in euros and British pounds. On average during fiscal year 2009, the United States dollar strengthened relative to the euro and British pound by approximately 7% and 26%, respectively. The aforementioned revenue declines were partially offset by revenue increases associated with acquisitions ($170 million), primarily due to our acquisition of Enturia in fiscal year 2008; international growth, exclusive of effects of foreign exchange ($32 million); and new products ($25 million). 40 Table of Contents Segment revenue is shown in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2009 2008 Change Critical Care Technologies $ 2,429 $ 2,603 (7 )% Medical Technologies and Services 2,072 1,915 8 % Revenue $ 4,501 $ 4,518 % Critical Care Technologies segment revenue decreased $174 million, or 7%, to $2,429 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume of capital equipment due to delays in hospital capital spending and the Alaris infusion device ship hold discussed above ($149 million) and the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($59 million), partially offset by increases in revenues associated with new products, largely due to new respiratory ventilator equipment products ($20 million). Medical Technologies and Services segment revenue increased $157 million, or 8%, to $2,072 million, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue increase was primarily due to acquisitions (approximately $170 million); increased sales to existing customers, primarily surgical gloves and one month of year over year revenue growth of the suite of Enturias infection prevention products (combined $50 million); and international revenue growth, excluding effects of foreign exchange rates ($40 million). These increases were partially offset by the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($59 million) and divestitures ($16 million). Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold increased $47 million, or 2%, to $2,519 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products sold increased to 56% in fiscal year 2009 from 55% in fiscal year 2008. The increase in cost of products sold was due to the costs associated with incremental revenues from acquisitions, primarily Enturia; increases in international sales volume; and increases in petroleum based raw materials; partially offset by the decrease in sales volume of capital equipment. Gross Margin For the foregoing reasons, gross margin decreased $64 million, or 3%, to $1,982 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 44% and 45% in fiscal year 2009 and 2008, respectively. During fiscal year 2009, gross margin as a percentage of revenue was negatively affected by international pricing pressure; the effects of foreign exchange, in which the benefits of changes in foreign exchange rates associated with our procurement transactions were more than outweighed by unfavorable impacts associated with sales transactions; and the adverse effects of the under utilization of our capital equipment manufacturing facilities. Partially offsetting these effects were increased sales volumes in certain of our infection prevention and skin preparation businesses and a shift in sales mix favoring disposable products within our Critical Care Technologies segment due to the decline in sales volume of capital equipment. Our infection prevention, skin preparation, and disposable products each recognize higher margins than our other product offerings. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses increased $51 million, or 5%, to $1,155 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. SG&A expenses increased primarily due to 41 Table of Contents acquisitions ($54 million), additional investments in product quality processes ($11 million), and additional provisions for bad debts ($4 million). These increases were partially offset by a decrease due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($29 million) and a decrease in management incentive compensation expense ($24 million). SG&A expenses allocated by Cardinal Health to us during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were $406 million and $407 million, respectively. Allocated SG&A expenses include expenses for shared functions, including management, finance, financial shared services, human resources, information technology, legal, legislative affairs and management incentive plan expenses. SG&A expenses historically allocated to us are not likely to be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented or for future periods following our separation from Cardinal Health. Research and Development Research and development expenses increased $3 million, or 2%, to $165 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges Restructuring and acquisition integration charges increased $36 million, or 97%, to $73 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Restructuring and acquisition integration charges incurred in fiscal 2009 were primarily comprised of integration expenses associated with Viasys ($9 million); employee related restructuring costs ($40 million); and facility exit costs ($21 million). In the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, we announced a cost reduction initiative primarily in response to the delay in hospital capital spending and the overall decline in the global economy. Under this initiative, we will reduce our global workforce by approximately 800 people, and eliminate an additional 500 positions through normal attrition and by not filling open roles. In fiscal year 2009, we recorded a $19 million pre tax restructuring charge associated with this cost reduction initiative, included within employee related restructuring costs identified above, and expect to record an additional $14 million pre tax restructuring charge in fiscal year 2010. Restructuring and acquisition integration charges incurred in fiscal 2008 were primarily comprised of integration costs associated with our acquisition of Viasys and restructuring costs related to the closure of a replenishment center, headcount reductions within existing operations and other facility exit costs. Acquired In process Research and Development In connection with our acquisition of certain businesses in fiscal year 2008, we obtained in process research and development projects, or IPR&D. At the time of acquisition, these projects had not yet achieved technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative use and, accordingly, the estimated fair value of the IPR&D was expensed at the acquisition date. During fiscal 2008, we recorded charges to write off our preliminary estimates of fair values of the IPR&D associated with the Enturia acquisition ($18 million), other minor acquisitions ($25 million), and adjusted downward the IPR&D charges initially recorded in fiscal year 2007 associated with the Viasys acquisition based on the final valuation of its related IPR&D in fiscal 2008 ($25 million). Operating Income For the foregoing reasons, operating income decreased $136 million, or 19%, to $589 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13% in fiscal 2009 compared to 16% in the prior fiscal year. 42 Table of Contents Segment profit from our two reporting segments, Critical Care Technologies and Medical Technologies and Services, is shown in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2009 2008 Change Critical Care Technologies $ 402 $ 511 (21 )% Medical Technologies and Services 260 269 (3 )% Segment Profit 662 780 (15 )% Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 73 37 Acquired In Process Research and Development 18 Operating Income $ 589 $ 725 Critical Care Technologies segment profit decreased $109 million, or 21%, to $402 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in segment profit was primarily a result of a lower sales volume of capital equipment due to the delay in hospital capital spending and the Alaris infusion device ship hold ($85 million) and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($22 million). Segment profit as a percentage of segment revenue was 17% and 20% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Medical Technologies and Services segment profit decreased $9 million, or 3%, to $260 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in segment profit was primarily due to increased raw materials costs ($47 million), and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($26 million), partially offset by the profitability of prior year acquisitions ($52 million). Segment profit as a percentage of segment revenue was 13% and 14% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Interest Expense and Other Interest expense and other, net increased $36 million, or 54%, to $103 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest expense and other, net was primarily the result of increases in losses due to changes in foreign exchange rates ($38 million) and decreases in interest income earned ($6 million), partially offset by a reduction in interest expense allocated to us by Cardinal Health ($8 million). Interest expense allocated to us by Cardinal Health totaled $80 million and $88 million in fiscal year 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in allocated interest expense was primarily due to lower levels of debt allocated to us by Cardinal Health. See note 9 to the audited combined financial statements for further information. Royalty Income and Other, Net Received From Parent Royalty income and other, net received from parent increased $44 million, or 23%, to $233 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. As a result of our separation from Cardinal Health, we no longer receive this royalty income, as the intellectual property underlying the royalty income remained with Cardinal Health. Provision for Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, our provision for income taxes decreased $33 million, or 18%, to $151 million, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in income tax expense was due to a reduction in income before income taxes, a decrease related to a claim filed with the IRS to amend our position relative to sales type lease transactions ($24 million), and a decrease for the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the impact of internal reorganizations ($21 million). These decreases in tax are partially offset by an unfavorable tax adjustment for accrued interest related to proposed tax assessments ($9 million), the 43 Table of Contents impact of an increase in our overall state tax rate for the current year before the favorable effect of audit settlements ($6 million), and the impact of nondeductible IPR&D charges in fiscal 2008 ($9 million). As a result of this activity, our effective tax rate decreased slightly to 21.0% in fiscal year 2009 from 21.8% in fiscal year 2008. During the third quarter of 2009, Cardinal Health filed a claim with the IRS to amend the filing position taken on its U.S. federal income tax return for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 related to a secured loan transaction involving certain of our sales type lease receivables. Since our income taxes are presented on a separate return basis, we recognized a $24 million net tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 related to this item. Generally, fluctuations in our effective tax rate are primarily due to changes within international and state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of restructuring and acquisition integration charges and other discrete items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item. The provision for income tax amounts historically calculated is not likely to be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented or for future periods following the separation. Cardinal Health files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. Our operations have historically been included in Cardinal Healths results. With few exceptions, Cardinal Health is subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years ended June 30, 2001 through the current fiscal year. The IRS currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2007. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, Cardinal Health received an IRS Revenue Agent Report for tax years 2003 through 2005 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in the notice totals $462 million, excluding penalties and interest, which may be significant. We and Cardinal Health disagree with these proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them. Although we believe that we have provided adequate contingent tax reserves for these matters under FIN No. 48, we may not be fully reserved for this matter and it is possible that we may be obligated to pay an amount in excess of the reserve, including the full amount that the IRS is seeking. Under the tax matters agreement between CareFusion and Cardinal Health, the resolution of the matter will be allocated to us. If this matter is not resolved in our favor, it may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For additional detail regarding the provision for income taxes, see note 10 to our audited combined financial statements. Net Income For the foregoing reasons, net income decreased $95 million, or 14%, to $568 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Net income as a percentage of revenue was 13% and 15% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, % of Revenue (in millions) 2008 2007 Change 2008 2007 Revenue $ 4,518 $ 3,478 30 % Cost of Products Sold 2,472 1,911 29 % 55 % 55 % Gross Margin 2,046 1,567 31 % 45 % 45 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 1,104 890 24 % 24 % 26 % Research and Development Expenses 162 103 57 % 4 % 3 % Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 37 24 54 % 1 % 1 % Acquired In Process Research and Development 18 85 (79 )% % 2 % Operating Income 725 465 56 % 16 % 13 % Interest Expense and Other, Net (Including Net Interest Expense Allocated from Parent of $88 and $72 for Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007, respectively) 67 55 22 % 1 % 2 % Royalty (Income) and Other, Net Received from Parent (189 ) (208 ) (9 )% (4 )% (6 )% Income Before Income Taxes 847 618 37 % 19 % 18 % Provision for Income Taxes 184 116 59 % 4 % 3 % Net Income $ 663 $ 502 32 % 15 % 14 % Revenue Revenue increased $1,040 million, or 30%, to $4,518 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenue growth was favorably affected by acquisitions ($626 million); increased sales volume to existing customers ($154 million); international revenue growth ($130 million), which included the positive effect of foreign exchange rates ($91 million); and new products ($95 million). Segment revenue is shown in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2008 2007 Change Critical Care Technologies $ 2,603 $ 1,905 37 % Medical Technologies and Services 1,915 1,573 22 % Revenue $ 4,518 $ 3,478 30 % Critical Care Technologies segment revenue increased $698 million, or 37%, to $2,603 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was due primarily to acquisitions ($420 million), primarily related to increased sales of respiratory equipment from the Viasys acquisition; increased sales to existing customers ($115 million), largely related to medication dispensing equipment; increased revenue from new products ($73 million) and new customers ($33 million), largely related to new infusion product releases and successful competitive infusion product placements; the favorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($33 million); and financing interest on sales type leases ($14 million). Medical Technologies and Services segment revenue increased $342 million, or 22%, to $1,915 million, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Acquisitions increased revenue by $206 million, primarily related to increased sales of neurological diagnostic equipment from the Viasys 45 Table of Contents acquisition and infection prevention products from the Enturia acquisition. Revenue also increased from sales to existing customers ($39 million), sales of new products ($22 million), including domestic surgical gloves and medical specialties products, as well as an increase in international revenue ($101 million), primarily across Europe, which included the favorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($59 million). Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold increased $561 million, or 29%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Cost of products sold increased primarily due to acquisitions ($334 million), primarily related to the Viasys acquisition; the aforementioned increases in sales to existing customers and new products ($139 million); and the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($43 million). In addition, our Medical Technologies and Services segment experienced increases in the costs of petroleum based raw materials ($8 million) and our Critical Care Technologies segment experienced increased costs associated with infusion product recalls ($4 million). Gross Margin For the foregoing reasons, gross margin increased $479 million, or 31%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45% in each year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased $214 million, or 24%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to acquisitions ($192 million); the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($21 million); and increased variable costs associated with our revenue growth, partially offset by decreases in equity based and other variable compensation ($21 million); and a decrease in SG&A expenses allocated to us by Cardinal Health ($21 million). SG&A expenses allocated by Cardinal Health to us during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 were $407 million and $428 million, respectively. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 24% and 26% for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Research and Development R&D expenses increased $59 million, or 57%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to acquisitions ($40 million), primarily the Viasys acquisition, and increased spending on innovation ($9 million). Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges Restructuring and acquisition integration charges increased $13 million to $37 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to increased acquisition integration charges ($16 million) partially offsetting a reduction in restructuring charges ($3 million). The acquisition integration charges incurred during fiscal 2008 were primarily a result of the acquisition of Viasys ($24 million). The acquisition integration charges incurred during fiscal 2007 were primarily a result of the acquisition of Viasys ($8 million). Restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2008 related to the closure of a replenishment center, headcount reductions within existing operations and other facility exit costs. The restructuring costs incurred for fiscal 2007 related to facility closures, a global restructuring program initiated in fiscal 2005 and projects aimed at improvements in manufacturing cost and efficiency. See note 3 to the audited combined financial statements for additional detail regarding these restructuring and acquisition integration charges. 46 Table of Contents Acquired In process Research and Development In connection with our acquisition of certain businesses in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, we obtained in process research and development projects, or IPR&D. At the time of acquisition, these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative use and, accordingly, the estimated fair value of the IPR&D was expensed at the acquisition date. These projects primarily related to the following areas: Infection prevention (acquired in connection with the fiscal 2008 acquisition of Enturia); Respiratory therapy diagnostic instruments and ventilation products (acquired in connection with the fiscal 2007 acquisition of Viasys); and Surgical devices (acquired in connection with the 2008 acquisition of other businesses that were individually not significant). IPR&D decreased $67 million to $18 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2008, we recorded charges to write off our preliminary estimates of fair values of the IPR&D associated with the Enturia acquisition ($18 million) and other acquisitions ($25 million). During fiscal 2008, we finalized the valuation of the IPR&D associated with the Viasys acquisition and recorded an adjustment ($25 million) to reduce the cumulative IPR&D charge associated with the Viasys acquisition to $59 million. During fiscal 2007, we recorded a charge to write off our preliminary estimate of the fair value of the IPR&D associated with the Viasys acquisition ($84 million). The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow was determined based upon projected revenue, expenses and contributory assets related to the specific project and a discount rate based upon the overall weighted average cost of capital for the asset and the additional risk related to the uncertainty of the project. We also assessed the current status of development, nature and timing of efforts to complete such development, uncertainties, and other factors when estimating the fair value. Costs were not assigned to IPR&D unless future development was probable. At the time of acquisition, the in process projects were at various stages of completion with some requiring several years to reach commercialization. The estimated cost to complete the projects at the date of the acquisitions was $33 million. The majority of the technology has not yet come to fruition as it is still in process; however, completion is expected for all projects by the end of calendar year 2011. See note 2 to the audited combined financial statements for additional detail regarding acquired IPR&D. Operating Income For the foregoing reasons, operating income increased $260 million, or 56%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 16% from 13% in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. Segment profit from our two reporting segments, Critical Care Technologies and Medical Technologies and Services, is shown in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2008 2007 Change Critical Care Technologies $ 511 $ 345 48 % Medical Technologies and Services 269 229 17 % Segment Profit 780 574 36 % Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 37 24 Acquired In Process Research and Development 18 85 Operating Income $ 725 $ 465 47 Table of Contents Critical Care Technologies segment profit increased $166 million, or 48%, to $511 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit was primarily a result of the profitability associated with acquisitions ($38 million); favorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($16 million); and the remainder due primarily to earnings associated with non acquisition related revenue growth. Segment profit as a percentage of revenue was 20% and 18% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Medical Technologies and Services segment profit increased $40 million, or 17%, to $269 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit was primarily a result of profitability associated with acquisitions ($22 million); favorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($11 million); and the earnings associated with the increases in sales to existing customers and new products. Segment profit as a percentage of revenue was 14% and 15% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Interest Expense and Other Interest expense and other increased $12 million, or 22%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense ($14 million) primarily resulting from increased levels of debt allocated to us by Cardinal Health. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, interest expense allocated to us by Cardinal Health was $88 million and $72 million, respectively. Royalty Income and Other, Net Received From Parent Royalty income and other, net received from parent decreased $19 million, or 9%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. As a result of the separation, the intellectual property underlying the royalty income remained with Cardinal Health. Provision for Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, our provision for income taxes increased $68 million, or 59%, to $184 million, compared to the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was 21.8% compared to 18.8% for the prior fiscal year. The increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate was due to an increase in the overall proportion of domestic income which is taxed at higher rates than foreign income ($91 million), and a revaluation of state deferred tax assets and liabilities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 ($17 million). These increases were partially offset by the effect of a one time permanent difference during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 for non deductible IPR&D associated with the Viasys acquisition ($40 million). Net Income For the foregoing reasons, net income increased $161 million, or 32%, to $663 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Net income as a percentage of revenue was 15% and 14% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Historically, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, positive cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations primarily represents inflows from net income (adjusted for depreciation and other non cash items) and outflows from investment in sales type leases entered into, as we sell and install dispensing equipment, and other increases in working capital needed to grow the business. Cash flows from investing 48 Table of Contents activities represent our investment in intellectual property and capital equipment required to grow, as well as acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities are primarily changes in Cardinal Healths investment in us. In the past, Cardinal Health would fund our operating and investing activities as needed and transfer our excess cash at its discretion. Transfers of cash both to and from Cardinal Healths cash management system are reflected as a component of Parent Company Investment within Parent Company Equity in the combined balance sheets. As a result of our separation from Cardinal Health, our capital structure, long term capital commitments and sources of liquidity have changed significantly from our historical capital structure as described herein. In addition, we will no longer receive cash from Cardinal Health to fund our operating or investing needs. Instead, our ability to fund our capital needs will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, overall capacity and terms of financing arrangements, and access to the capital markets. We believe that our future cash from operations together with our access to funds available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities and the capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and new business development activities. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008, and 2007: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash Flow Provided by/(Used in) Operating Activities $ 803 $ 886 $ 520 Investing Activities $ (154 ) $ (773 ) $ (1,722 ) Financing Activities $ (421 ) $ (250 ) $ 1,681 Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $83 million to $803 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income, after adjustment for non cash items ($195 million); reduced cash flows associated with other accrued liabilities and operating items ($28 million), primarily consisting of cash outflows related to employee related accrued liabilities, and merger and restructuring liabilities. These reductions in operating cash flows were partially offset by increased cash flows from collections of accounts receivable ($87 million) and sales type capital leases ($88 million). Net cash used in investing activities decreased $619 million to $154 million compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily related to the cash purchase price of Enturia in fiscal 2008 ($476 million) and reductions in capital expenditures ($60 million). The net cash used in financing for both years was primarily the result of net cash transfers to and from Cardinal Health. Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $366 million to $886 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income, after adjustments for non cash items ($239 million); and increased cash inflows associated with trade receivables and inventories ($157 million). Reductions in inventory balances were the result of significant efforts made in fiscal 2008 to reduce inventory on hand within our Medical Technologies and Services segment. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $949 million to $773 million for the same period, primarily related to differences in purchase price for Enturia in fiscal 2008 compared to Viasys in fiscal 2007 and additional capital expenditures. The net cash used in financing for both years was primarily the result of net cash transfers to and from Cardinal Health. 49 Table of Contents Capital Resources Cardinal Health uses a centralized approach to U.S. domestic cash management and financing of its operations, excluding debt directly incurred by any of its businesses, such as debt assumed in an acquisition or certain capital lease obligations. Prior to the separation, the majority of our domestic cash was transferred to Cardinal Health daily, and Cardinal Health funded our operating and investing activities as needed. Accordingly, a portion of Cardinal Healths consolidated debt has been allocated to us based on our debt capacity consistent with an investment grade credit rating, including amounts directly incurred. Cardinal Healths historical long term debt balances were allocated to us based on a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, which, based on discussions with external advisors and comparisons with BBB rated companies in the S&P 500, is consistent with an investment grade credit rating. This allocation methodology is also generally consistent with managements long term capital structure plans for CareFusion as a separate, stand alone company. In contrast, short term debt balances (e.g., commercial paper, bank loans) held at the corporate level were not allocated down to CareFusion as this debt was issued to fund the operations of the Cardinal Health healthcare supply chain services businesses. As both CareFusion and Cardinal Health have established post spin capital structures that support investment grade credit ratings, we believe that utilizing financial metric targets to allocate historical third party debt is reasonable and appropriate. Total debt at June 30, 2009 was $1,289 million, of which $1,281 million was due to Cardinal Health. Total debt at June 30, 2008 was $1,609 million, of which $1,597 million was due to Cardinal Health. We believe that the allocation basis for debt is reasonable based on our debt capacity consistent with an investment grade credit rating. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Our cash and equivalents balance as of June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, included $767 million and $568 million of cash, respectively, held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so on more than a temporary basis could subject it to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. Bridge Loan Facility. In connection with the separation, On July 1, 2009, we entered into a senior unsecured bridge loan facility (the bridge loan facility) to provide financing for an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, with a term of 364 days from the date of any funding, for payment of the distribution to Cardinal Health as part of our spinoff. As the senior unsecured note offering (see below) was successfully completed prior to the separation, those proceeds were used to finance the payment of the distribution to Cardinal Health in lieu of drawing the bridge loan facility. As a result, the bridge loan facility was terminated on August 31, 2009. Revolving Credit Facilities. On July 1, 2009, we also entered into two senior unsecured revolving credit facilities with an aggregate principal amount of $720 million, with commitments thereunder allocated as follows: $240 million 364 day revolving credit facility; and $480 million three year revolving credit facility. The commitments under the three year revolving credit facility are subject to increase, upon our request and consent by the lenders, by up to an aggregate of $30 million, subject to certain conditions and commitments. Borrowings under the three year revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate per annum based upon the London interbank offered rate for dollars (LIBOR) or the alternate base rate (ABR), in each case, plus an applicable margin, which in the case of LIBOR varies from 2.1% to 3.375% depending on CareFusions debt ratings and in the case of ABR varies from 1.1% to 2.375% depending on CareFusions debt ratings. Borrowings under the 364 day revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate per annum based upon LIBOR or ABR, in each case, plus an applicable margin, which in the case of LIBOR varies from 2.2% to 3.5% based upon CareFusions debt ratings and in the case of ABR varies from 1.2% to 2.5% based upon CareFusions debt ratings. All obligations under the revolving credit facilities will continue to be guaranteed by each of our existing and future direct and indirect material domestic subsidiaries. 50 Table of Contents The revolving credit facilities contain several customary covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, investments, dispositions, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, and sale and lease back transactions. The revolving credit facilities also contain financial covenants requiring CareFusion to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.00:1.00 at any time during any period of four fiscal quarters, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter of at least (i) 3.25:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ended on September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, (ii) 3.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended on March 31, 2010, and (iii) 3.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2010 and thereafter. The revolving credit facilities are subject to customary events of default, including, but not limited to, non payment of principal or other amounts when due, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross default to other material indebtedness, certain ERISA related events, certain voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy events, and change of control. We currently do not anticipate utilizing our revolving credit facilities for current operations as we believe that our anticipated cash flows will be sufficient. However, based on operating needs, strategic planning and other factors, we may utilize the revolving credit facilities in the future. Senior Unsecured Notes. On July 14, 2009, we offered and sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The notes consist of the following tranches: $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2012; $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2014; and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2019. The net proceeds of the offering were placed into an escrow account and were subsequently used to finance the distribution payment to Cardinal Health of approximately $1.4 billion related to our spinoff. The 2012 notes will mature on August 1, 2012, the 2014 notes will mature on August 1, 2014 and the 2019 notes will mature on August 1, 2019. In each case, interest will be paid on each February 1 and August 1, commencing February 1, 2010. The indenture for the senior notes limits our ability to incur certain secured debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. In accordance with the indenture, we may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or the sum of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of the senior notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to its present value, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360 day year consisting of twelve 30 day months) at an adjusted treasury rate plus 45 basis points in the case of the 2012 notes, 45 basis points in the case of the 2014 notes and 50 basis points in the case of the 2019 notes, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and experience a below investment grade rating event, each as defined in the senior notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. Dividends We currently intend to retain any income to finance research and development, acquisitions and the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any dividends in the future by us will be subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, income, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Moreover, if we determine to pay any dividend in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends. 51 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2009, our contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows: Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Long Term Debt1,7 $ 129 $ 296 $ 107 $ 754 $ 1,286 Capital Lease Obligations2 1 2 3 Other Long Term Liabilities3 17 20 7 1 45 Interest on Long Term Debt4,7 65 113 88 156 422 Operating Leases5 35 56 44 51 186 Purchase Obligations6 178 24 2 204 Total Financial Obligations $ 425 $ 511 $ 248 $ 962 $ 2,146 1 Represents maturities of our long term debt obligations, excluding capital lease obligations described below, as described in note 9 to the audited combined financial statements. 2 Represents maturities of our capital lease obligations included within long term debt on CareFusions balance sheet and the related estimated future interest payments. 3 Represents cash outflows by period for certain of our long term liabilities in which cash outflows could be reasonably estimated. Certain long term liabilities, such as unrecognized tax benefits of $271 million and deferred taxes of $575 million, have been excluded from the table above because of the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflow. See note 10 to the audited combined financial statements for additional information. 4 Interest obligation is calculated based on each outstanding debt stated or coupon rate, or existing variable rate as of June 30, 2009, as applicable. 5 Represents minimum rental payments and the related estimated future interest payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms as described in note 11 to the audited combined financial statements. 6 Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including the following: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. In addition, contracts that can be unilaterally cancelled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period. 7 Included within Long Term Debt and Interest on Long Term Debt are $1,281 million of long term debt and $421 million of interest expense associated with debt allocated to us from Cardinal Health. See note 9 to the audited combined financial statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements See note 18 to the audited combined financial statements for a discussion of off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical 52 Table of Contents accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant effect on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience, trends, and managements judgment. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and believe our estimates to be reasonable. Other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our combined financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see note 1 to our audited combined financial statements. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue through the sale and lease of equipment, software, services, medical products, supplies, and the income associated with the financing of our equipment leases. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB No. 104), we recognize revenue when each of the following criteria exists: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; product delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends on a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized may involve subjective or complex judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. The significant judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and could result in material differences under other assumptions and conditions are those described below. Evaluation of the Significance of Embedded Software We sell and lease products with embedded software. We regularly review these products to determine whether embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole. If the embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole, the product is classified as a software product and revenue for the product is recognized in accordance with the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position, or SOP, No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition (SOP No. 97 2). In classifying our products, we consider the following characteristics to be indicators that embedded software is more than incidental to the product as whole: software is a significant focus of the marketing effort or the software application is sold separately; significant internally developed software costs have been incurred; and if we provide telephone support, bug fixes, and or unspecified upgrades specific to the embedded software. The evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment as the products exhibit varying degrees of the indicators identified above, such as: certain products are marketed as systems or solutions wherein it is implied, but not explicitly stated within marketing and sales collateral, that embedded software provides the basis for significant functionalities identified within the marketing efforts; internal software development costs are incurred during the product development process; separately priced extended warranty services provide post installation support relative to repair parts 53 Table of Contents and services and also include telephone support and bug fixes for the software embedded within the products; and we are required by law to provide medical safety related bug fixes for products with embedded software elements. We classify our infusion products, when sold with safety software, and patient identification products as software. We have determined the embedded software within our other products, primarily our dispensing and respiratory products, is incidental to the products as a whole. Those products are therefore not classified as software. Product development trends indicate that embedded software, connectivity and interfacing with hospital information systems will continue to be components of, and possibly significant features of, future product releases. In the future, the embedded software inherent to these future products may be determined to be more than incidental to the product and as a result the product may be classified as software for revenue recognition purposes. If these future software products are sold with extended payment terms or subject to long term leases, the timing of revenue recognition for these products could change significantly as compared to similar transactions with hardware products. Specifically, we may be unable to determine the associated payments are fixed or determinable and, as a result, we may be precluded from recognizing revenue upon the completion of installation services as we would for a hardware product. Instead, we may be required to recognize revenue on these software products over time as payments become due from the customer. Revenue Recognition for Leases Our accounting for leases involves specific determinations under applicable lease accounting standards, which often involve complex and prescriptive provisions. If a lease qualifies as a sales type capital lease, equipment revenue is recognized upon delivery or installation of the equipment as opposed to ratably over the lease term. Therefore, our lease classification procedures significantly affect the timing of revenue recognition. The critical element considered by us in determining the classification of our lease transactions is the fair value of the leased equipment, including its estimated fair value at the inception and conclusion of the lease. For the purposes of determining the fair value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease, we apply the percentage discount from rental list prices provided within the lease transaction against the purchase list price. This methodology assumes that purchase customers are provided similar discounts as lease customers. Periodically, we review discount levels provided to purchase customers and lease customers to validate this assumption. Multiple Element Arrangements The majority of our transactions qualify as multiple element arrangements. We use the relative fair value method to allocate contract proceeds to each unit of accounting, which are then individually recognized to revenue. To the extent that fair value evidence does not exist for delivered elements of the transaction, we apply the residual method. Determination as to whether fair value exists and the valuation of our fair value estimates are critical to both the relative fair value method and residual method. The determination of fair value estimates associated with our products and services is generally based on historical evidence of sales of the same product in stand alone transactions and the contract renewal prices for post contract support and separately priced extended warranty services. For software and software related products, evidence used in the determination of fair value estimates are based solely on vendor specific objective evidence. Third party fair value evidence may be used for non software products. 54 Table of Contents Different conclusions as to the existence and valuation of fair value estimates may significantly affect the timing and valuation of revenue recognition, the classification of leasing transactions, and the classification of revenue as product, service, rental or other income. It is impossible to determine the effects of potential different conclusions as they relate to the existence or valuation of fair value estimates. Business Combinations Assumptions and estimates are used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets, which requires management to use significant judgment in determining fair value. Current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is affected by purchase price allocations and by the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles, excluding goodwill. We believe the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. In conjunction with the review of a transaction, the status of the acquired companys research and development projects is assessed to determine the existence of IPR&D. In connection with certain acquisitions, we are required to estimate the fair value of acquired IPR&D, which requires selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project. Management also assesses the current status of development, nature and timing of efforts to complete such development, uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value. Costs are not assigned to IPR&D unless future development is probable. Once the fair value is determined, an asset is established, and in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method (FIN No. 4), is immediately written off in our combined statement of income. During fiscal 2008, we reversed $25 million of a previously recorded write off of IPR&D costs associated with the acquisition of Viasys, as a result of the finalization of the Viasys purchase price allocation process and recorded charges of $18 million related to the write off of IPR&D costs associated with Enturia. During fiscal 2007, we recorded charges of $84 million and $1 million primarily related to the write off of IPR&D costs associated with Viasys (see note 2 to our audited combined financial statements). In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date within fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141(R) changes many aspects of business combinations, and could significantly influence how we pursue future business combinations. See note 1 to the audited combined financial statements for further information. Goodwill and Other Intangibles We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). Under SFAS No. 142, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily trademarks and patents, continue to be amortized over their useful lives. In conducting the impairment test, the fair value of our reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to assess impairment. We perform our impairment testing at the operating segment level as defined in SFAS No. 142 because all of the components of each operating segment are similar and none of their components are reporting units. Our determination of fair value of the reporting units is based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rates used for impairment testing are based on the risk free rate plus an adjustment for risk factors. Our impairment review process uses estimates of future revenue for the reporting units, driven by assumed market growth rates and projected operating margins. These estimates are consistent with the plans and assumptions that we use to manage the underlying businesses. 55 Table of Contents Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. The use of alternative estimates, changes in the industry or adjusting the discount rate could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment. Any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to our results of operations. We performed our annual impairment tests as of March 31, 2009, from which the fair value for each reporting segment exceeded the carrying value in our testing, therefore further analysis was not required and we did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges. If the carrying value had exceeded the fair value, we would have performed further analysis, comparing the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit to the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. The most significant input in our discounted cash flow model is the discount rate. Increasing the discount rate by 1 percentage point would not have indicated impairment for any of our reporting units. See note 7 to our audited combined financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangibles. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges We separately identify restructuring and acquisition integration charges in SG&A expenses. A restructuring activity is a program whereby we fundamentally change our operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146). Under SFAS No. 146, a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred. Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies. Upon acquisition, certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141), and other integration charges are recorded as special items as incurred. The majority of the charges related to restructuring and acquisition integration can be classified in one of the following categories: employee related costs, exit costs (including lease termination costs), asset impairments, IPR&D costs, and other integration costs. Employee related costs include severance and termination benefits. Lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees, forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income. Other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility. Asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of our assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities. IPR&D costs include the write off of research and development projects in process at the time of acquisition, which had not yet reached technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative use. Other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan. See note 3 to our audited financial statements for additional information. Provision for Income Taxes Our income taxes as presented are calculated on a separate tax return basis, although our operations have historically been included in Cardinal Healths U.S. federal and state tax returns or non U.S. jurisdictions tax returns. Cardinal Healths global tax model has been developed based on its entire portfolio of businesses. Accordingly, our tax results as presented are not necessarily reflective of the results that we would have generated on a stand alone basis. 56 Table of Contents With the exception of certain dedicated foreign entities, we do not maintain taxes payable to/from our parent and we are deemed to settle the annual current tax balances immediately with the legal tax paying entities in the respective jurisdictions. These settlements are reflected as changes in Parent Company Investment. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and measurement of uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the combined financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We had deferred income tax assets before valuation allowances of $299 million and $289 million as of June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. We also had deferred income tax liabilities of $852 million and $894 million as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At June 30, 2009, we had gross federal, state and international loss and credit carryforwards of $5 million, $209 million and $54 million, respectively, the tax effect of which is an aggregate deferred tax asset of $38 million. Substantially all of these carryforwards are available for at least three years or have an indefinite carryforward period. The valuation allowance of $22 million at June 30, 2009 applies to certain federal, international, and state and local carryforwards that, in the opinion of management, are more likely than not to expire unutilized. However, to the extent that tax benefits related to these carryforwards are realized in the future, the reduction in the valuation allowance would be applied against income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and measurement of uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. However, other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate, and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). This standard provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognizing benefits, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosures. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, Cardinal Health received an IRS Revenue Agents Report for the tax years 2003 through 2005 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in these notices totals $462 million, excluding penalties and interest, which may be significant. We and Cardinal Health disagree with the IRS regarding the application of the U.S. Treasury regulations to the arrangements under review and the valuations underlying such adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them. The proper transfer price to be charged among subsidiaries and the value of intellectual property transferred among subsidiaries are subjective determinations that depend on the specific facts and circumstances at issue. Management estimated a contingent tax reserve for these issues by first concluding that our positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The reserve was then determined by evaluating and weighing the technical merits of alternative valuation methodologies against each other and concluding on the positions that provide the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate resolution. To the extent there are any administrative or case law developments that provide additional evidence in favor or against the valuation methodologies utilized, the contingent tax reserve will be adjusted in the period that such developments occur. 57 Table of Contents Since it is not currently possible to predict whether and when any of these events will occur, we are unable to quantify potential changes. Although we believe that we have provided an appropriate contingent tax reserve for these matters under FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 48, we may not be fully reserved for this matter and it is possible that we may be obligated to pay an amount in excess of the reserve, including the full amount that the IRS is seeking. Any such obligation could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Loss Contingencies We accrue for contingencies related to litigation and other claims arising out of our business in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5) which requires us to assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in our combined financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these claims are often inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Share Based Compensation Cardinal Health maintains certain share based compensation plans that enable Cardinal Health to grant awards to all employees, including our employees, in the form of Cardinal Health equity based instruments. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Cardinal Health adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), applying the modified prospective method. This statement requires all equity based payments to employees, including grants of options, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of income based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair values of options granted after Cardinal Health adopted this statement were determined using a lattice valuation model, whereas all options granted prior to adoption of this statement were valued using a Black Scholes model. Our estimate of an options fair value depends on a complex estimation process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events. These events, estimates of which are entered within the option valuation model include, but are not limited to, stock price volatility, the expected option life, expected dividend yield and option forfeiture rates. Effective with all options granted subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we estimate our future stock price volatility based on implied volatility from traded options on Cardinal Healths common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant (7 years). We analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate the expected option life and forfeiture rates. We calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors. Once employee stock option values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results. SFAS No. 123(R) requires us, however, to compare our estimated option forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary. See note 17 to our audited combined financial statements for additional information regarding share based compensation. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, No. FAS 157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP FAS 157 2), which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within 58 Table of Contents those fiscal years. We adopted SFAS No. 157 for its financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, which did not result in recognition of a transaction adjustment to retained earnings or have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We will adopt the provisions for nonfinancial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. SFAS No. 161. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities, including (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133; and (iii) how derivative instruments and the related hedged item affect an entitys results of operations, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted SFAS No. 161 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Since SFAS No. 161 is a disclosure standard, this adoption did not have any impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS No. 165. In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events (SFAS No. 165). This statement provides guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This statement is effective for interim or fiscal periods ending after June 15, 2009, and is applied prospectively. We adopted SFAS No. 165 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009; this adoption did not have any impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Currency Risk Management By nature of our global operations, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. Our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Canadian dollar. We have historically used derivative financial instruments indirectly through our participation in the centralized hedging program of Cardinal Health, which are designed to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk. Cardinal Health did not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. As an independent company, we are currently evaluating our exposures and designing our hedging strategy following the separation. We anticipate that in the future we will also implement a program based on the use of a combination of financial derivatives such as forward contracts and options to manage our foreign exchange risk. See notes 1 and 13 to the audited combined financial statements for more information on historical foreign currency risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Changes in interest rates can impact us in several ways. The return we earn on investing our cash is based on floating interest rates, and changes in rates have a direct impact on our interest income. Our primary source of debt capital is currently at fixed rates and as a result, we have a net exposure to changes in interest rates. We expect to review our exposure and sensitivity to changes in interest rates following separation from Cardinal Health. In the event we decide to change our risk profile, we will likely use financial derivatives such as interest rate swaps to adjust our exposure to changes in rates. Commodity Price Risk Management We purchase commodities such as latex, heating oil, diesel fuel and polystyrene, among others for use in our manufacturing processes. We typically purchase these commodities at market prices, and as a result, are affected by market price fluctuations. We have historically, performed a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposures for the following fiscal year, but have chosen to not hedge these exposures as they were deemed to be insignificant. 59 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis presented below refer to and should be read in conjunction with the audited combined financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to CareFusion Corporation, CareFusion, we, us, our and our company refer to CareFusion Corporation and its combined subsidiaries. References in this information statement to Cardinal Health or parent refers to Cardinal Health and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Introduction Managements discussion and analysis, which we refer to as MD&A, of our results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to the audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. MD&A is organized as follows: Separation from Cardinal Health, Inc. This section provides an overview of the decision to separate CareFusion from Cardinal Health. Overview This section provides a general description of our business. Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations This section includes key issues, factors and trends that may have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial conditions. Principles of Combination and Basis of Presentation This section describes the major principles used to prepare the financial statements, including the allocation methodology and adjustments made to present our combined financial statements. Combined Results of Operations This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources This section provides a discussion of our financial condition and cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007. Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates This section describes the accounting policies and estimates that we consider most important for our business and that require significant judgment. Separation from Cardinal Health, Inc. On September 29, 2008, Cardinal Health announced that it intended to separate its clinical and medical products businesses from the remainder of its businesses through a pro rata distribution of the common stock of an entity holding the assets and liabilities associated with the clinical and medical products businesses. CareFusion Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 2009 for the purpose of holding such businesses. We completed the spinoff from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health contributed the majority of the businesses comprising its clinical and medical products segment to us (the contribution), and distributed approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 179.8 million shares, to its shareholders (the distribution), based on a distribution ration of 0.5 shares of our common stock for each common share of Cardinal Health held on the record date of August 25, 2009. Cardinal Health retained approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 41.4 million shares, in connection with the spinoff. As a condition to the separation, Cardinal Health is required to dispose of the remaining 19% of our common stock within five years of the distribution date. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health retained certain lines of business that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the U.S. markets that were historically managed by us prior to the 33 Table of Contents spinoff, which were part of the clinical and medical products businesses of Cardinal Health. These lines of businesses are reflected in the CareFusion financial information, primarily in the medical technologies and services segment. This MD&A is written based on the fact that these businesses are incorporated within CareFusions financial position, results of operations and cash flows on an as managed basis. Going forward, starting with our Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, these businesses will be presented within our financial statements as discontinued operations as of the spinoff date of August 31, 2009. In connection with the separation and other restructuring activities not related to the separation, we expect to incur one time expenditures of between approximately $120 million to $130 million in fiscal 2010. These expenditures primarily consist of employee related costs, costs to start up certain stand alone functions and information technology systems and other one time transaction related costs. Also included are approximately $21 million of capitalized fees associated with our bridge loan facility that were expensed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to the termination of that agreement on August 31, 2009. We expect to fund these costs through cash from operations, cash on hand and, if necessary, cash available from our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities. A portion of these expenditures will be capitalized and amortized over their useful lives and others will be expensed as incurred, depending on their nature. Additionally, we will incur increased costs as an independent, publicly traded company, primarily as a result of higher charges than in the past from Cardinal Health for transition services and from establishing or expanding the corporate support for our businesses, including information technology, human resources, treasury, tax, risk management, accounting and financial reporting, investor relations, legal, procurement and other services. In the first year following the separation, these annual operating costs are estimated to be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher than the general corporate expenses we reported historically as being allocated to us from Cardinal Health. We believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these additional corporate expenses. We do not anticipate that increased costs solely from becoming an independent, publicly traded company will have an adverse effect on our growth rate in the future beyond fiscal 2010. We believe that the separation will allow us to: improve strategic planning, increase management focus and streamline decision making by providing us the flexibility to implement our unique strategic plans and to respond more effectively to our customer needs and the changing economic environment; allow us to adopt the capital structure, investment policy and dividend policy best suited to our financial profile and business needs, as well as resolve the current competition for capital among Cardinal Health and its investors; and facilitate incentive compensation arrangements for employees more directly tied to the performance of our business, and enhance employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives, while at the same time creating an independent equity structure that will facilitate our ability to effect future acquisitions utilizing our common stock. create a base of shareholders interested in Medical Technologies. Overview We are a global medical technology company with clinically proven and industry leading products and services designed to measurably improve the safety and quality of healthcare. We offer comprehensive product lines in the areas of IV infusion, medication and supply dispensing, respiratory care, infection prevention and surgical instruments. Our offerings include established brands used in hospitals throughout the United States and in more than 120 countries worldwide. Our primary product brands include: Alaris, Pyxis, AVEA, Pulmonetic Systems, Jaeger, SensorMedics, ChloraPrep and V. Mueller. 34 Table of Contents Our primary customers in the United States include hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, clinics, long term care facilities and physician offices. For both the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and 2008, we generated revenue of $4.5 billion, and net income of $568 million for fiscal 2009 and $663 million for fiscal 2008. Approximately, 76% of our fiscal 2009 revenue was from customers in the United States and 24% was from customers outside of the United States. In fiscal 2009, we introduced 17 new or enhanced products, and our innovation pipeline includes numerous additional new or enhanced products that are expected to be launched over the next 18 months. Our strategy is to enhance growth by focusing on healthcare safety and productivity, driving innovation and clinical differentiation, accelerating our global growth and pursuing strategic opportunities. Our business consists of two reporting segments: Critical Care Technologies and Medical Technologies and Services. Critical Care Technologies includes our infusion, dispensing and respiratory care businesses that develop, manufacture and sell capital equipment and related dedicated and non dedicated disposables. Medical Technologies and Services includes our infection prevention and medical specialties products and services businesses that develop, manufacture and sell primarily single use, disposable products and reusable surgical instruments. Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations The Overall Global Economic Environment, Industry Growth and Trends Healthcare related industries are generally less susceptible than some other industries to fluctuations in the overall economic environment. However, some of our businesses rely on capital spending from our customers (primarily hospitals), which spending can be influenced by a variety of economic factors, including interest rates, access to financing and endowment fluctuations. Significant changes in these economic factors can affect the sales of our capital equipment products, such as infusion pumps, dispensing equipment and ventilators. Additionally, sales volumes for some of our businesses are dependent on hospital admissions. Changes in admissions due to difficult economic times can affect our results for surgical and single use products, such as infusion and respiratory disposable sets, surgical instruments and infection prevention products. Since the beginning of fiscal 2009, we have observed certain hospitals delaying capital equipment purchase decisions, which had an adverse impact on our financial results for fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, and which we expect will have an adverse impact on our financial results through the middle of calendar year 2010. Moreover, while global healthcare expenditures are projected to grow over the coming years, reimbursement and funding for these expenditures is declining. These factors are creating both pressure and opportunity in the marketplace. Primarily in response to the delay in hospital capital spending and the overall decline in the global economy, we implemented global workforce reduction in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, which will reduce our workforce by approximately 800 people over a six month period, and eliminate an additional 500 positions through normal attrition and by not filling open roles. In addition, we have implemented cost control measures and additional reductions in discretionary spending. We recorded a $19 million pre tax restructuring charge for fiscal 2009 associated with these actions, and anticipate an additional $14 million pre tax restructuring charge for fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010 and beyond, we expect to see a benefit within our operating income due to reduced expenses as a result of these cost reduction initiatives. In addition to the factors discussed above, we also anticipate that the current presidential administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. The uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation may, while such uncertainties remain unresolved, have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and services. At this time we cannot predict which, if any, healthcare reform proposals will be adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us. 35 Table of Contents Innovation and New Products Our business strategy relies significantly on innovation to develop and introduce new products and to differentiate our products from our competitors. Our investment expense in research and development increased $3 million from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. Looking forward, we expect our research and development expenditures to further increase at a higher rate as we make additional investments to support our growth strategies. We plan to increase our research and development expenditures with internal initiatives, as well as licensing or acquiring technology from third parties. Our internal and external investments will be focused on initiatives that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. With a significant investment in research and development, a strong focus on innovation and a well managed innovation process, we believe we can continue to innovate and grow. If, however, our future innovations are not successful in meeting customers needs or prove to be too costly versus their perceived benefit, our growth may slow. Competition We operate in highly competitive markets. Our success depends on, among other things, establishing and maintaining strong customer relationships, brand recognition and technological and functional advantage for our products, particularly in our capital equipment businesses. If we fail to maintain a strong competitive position, then customers may choose not to buy our products or we may be forced to discount our products to maintain market share. International and Foreign Exchange We sell our products in more than 120 countries and manufacture our products in nine countries in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Due to the global nature of our business, our revenue and expenses are influenced by foreign exchange movements. In fiscal 2009, approximately 23% of our sales were in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies will affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars. The percentage of fiscal 2009 sales by major currencies was as follows: U.S. Dollar 77.0 % Euro 11.5 % British Pound 3.6 % All Other 7.9 % 100.0 % Product Quality and Recalls Product quality, particularly in life saving and sustaining technologies, plays a critical role in our success. A quality or safety issue may result in public warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made outside the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. Any of the foregoing events could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, recalls may negatively affect sales due to customer concerns about product quality. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our results were negatively affected by net charges for the cost of product recalls of $21 million, $18 million and $14 million, respectively. We are currently operating 36 Table of Contents our infusion business under a consent decree from the FDA, which was entered into in fiscal 2007 to resolve seizure litigation over Alaris SE pumps and amended in fiscal 2009 to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for our subsidiary that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the United States. On April 24, 2009, we submitted the corrective action plan required by the amended consent decree to the FDA. Included in the corrective action plan was, among other proposed corrective actions, a software correction that addresses a potential risk identified with the Alaris PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) module when used with the Alaris PC Unit operating with software versions 8 through 9.1. When the products are used together, the Alaris PCA module may infuse above or below the intended infusion dose if a specific sequence of events occurs. We recorded a reserve of $18 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 for the Alaris System, based on our estimate of the costs that will be incurred in connection with the corrective action plan. On June 2, 2009, the FDA notified us that the corrective action plan was acceptable and that we should begin implementation of the plan. We had placed a hold on shipping the Alaris PCA module and related Alaris PC Unit pending 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the software correction. We received 510(k) clearance on July 9, 2009 and have since resumed shipments. In response to infusion product recalls and the consent decree, we have made substantial investments in quality systems and quality personnel headcount over the past several years. While we believe that we have made significant improvements to our product quality and overall quality systems, further quality concerns, whether real or perceived, could adversely affect our results. Conversely, improving quality can be a competitive advantage and improve our results. Income Taxes Our operations have historically been included in Cardinal Healths U.S. federal and state tax returns or non U.S. jurisdictions tax returns. Prior to the separation, we and Cardinal Health entered into a tax matters agreement that governs the parties respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes. The IRS currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2007. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, Cardinal Health received an IRS Revenue Agents Report for the tax years 2003 through 2005 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in these notices totals $462 million, excluding penalties and interest, which may be significant. We and Cardinal Health disagree with the IRS regarding its application of the U.S. Treasury regulations to the arrangements under review and the valuations underlying such adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them. We believe that we have provided adequate contingent tax reserves for these matters under FIN No. 48. The tax matters agreement specifies that this matter, including the control of audit proceedings and payment of any additional liability, is our responsibility. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was 21%. However, certain of the businesses included in our combined financial statements that have a significant favorable foreign tax rate compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate were retained by Cardinal Health in the spinoff. In addition, there is an unfavorable impact on our effective state income tax rate as a result of the spinoff. We expect that our effective tax rate after the spinoff will be higher than what is included in our historical combined financial statements. Acquisitions Acquisitions have historically played a significant role in our growth. Significant acquisitions made in the last five years include VIASYS Healthcare Inc., or Viasys, and the assets of Enturia, Inc., or Enturia. While we believe that the integration of these acquisitions has generally been successful, our failure to complete or integrate future acquisitions successfully might negatively affect our results. For further information regarding acquisitions, see Combined Results of Operations below and note 2 to the audited combined financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Principles of Combination and Basis of Presentation Our combined financial statements presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, and discussed below, have been prepared on a stand alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cardinal Health. The combined financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as we were historically managed, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Included within our combined financial statements are the results of certain businesses which have historically been managed by us but that were retained by Cardinal Health in the spinoff. Our fiscal year ends on June 30. All significant intra company transactions and accounts have been eliminated. All significant intercompany transactions between us and Cardinal Health have been included in these combined financial statements and are considered to be effectively settled for cash in the combined financial statements at the time the transaction is recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions is reflected in the combined statements of cash flow as a financing activity and in the combined balance sheets as Parent Company Investment. Our combined financial statements include expenses of Cardinal Health allocated to us for certain functions provided by Cardinal Health, including, but not limited to, general corporate expenses related to finance, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, ethics and compliance, shared services, employee benefits and incentives, insurance and stock based compensation. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, Cardinal Health allocated to us general corporate expenses of $406 million, $407 million and $428 million, respectively. These expenses have been allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on the basis of revenue, headcount or other measures. Both we and Cardinal Health consider the basis on which the expenses have been allocated to be a reasonable reflection of the services provided to or the benefit received by us during the periods presented. The allocations may not, however, reflect the expense we would have incurred as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Actual costs that may have been incurred if we had been a stand alone company would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure, what functions were outsourced or performed by employees, and strategic decisions made in areas such as information technology and infrastructure. Following the separation, we will perform these functions using our own resources or purchased services. For an interim period, however, some of these functions will continue to be provided by Cardinal Health under the transition services agreement. In addition to the transition services agreement, we entered into a number of commercial agreements with Cardinal Health in connection with the separation, many of which have terms longer than one year. Cardinal Health uses a centralized approach to U.S. domestic cash management and financing of its operations, excluding debt directly incurred by any of its businesses, such as debt assumed in an acquisition or certain capital lease obligations. The majority of our domestic cash was transferred to Cardinal Health daily and Cardinal Health funded our operating and investing activities as needed. A portion of Cardinal Healths consolidated debt has been allocated to us based on the debt levels consistent with an investment grade credit rating, including amounts directly incurred. Cardinal Healths historical long term debt balances were allocated to us based on a debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, leverage ratio, which, based on discussions with external advisors and comparisons with BBB rated companies in the S&P 500, is consistent with an investment grade credit rating. This allocation methodology is also generally consistent with managements long term capital structure plans for CareFusion as a separate, stand alone company. In contrast, short term debt balances (e.g., commercial paper, bank loans) held at the corporate level were not allocated down to CareFusion as this debt was issued to fund the operations of the Cardinal Health healthcare supply chain services businesses. As both CareFusion and Cardinal Health have established post spin capital structures that support investment grade credit ratings, we believe that utilizing financial metric targets to allocate historical third party debt is reasonable and appropriate. Cardinal Health debt allocated as of June 30, 2009 and 2008 was $1,281 million and $1,597 million, respectively. Net interest expense has been allocated in the same proportions as debt and includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges. For fiscal years 38 Table of Contents 2009, 2008 and 2007, Cardinal Health has allocated to us net interest expense of $80 million, $88 million and $72 million, respectively. Cash transfers to and from Cardinal Healths U.S. domestic cash management accounts are reflected in Parent Company Investment in the combined balance sheets. We believe that the allocation basis for debt and net interest expense is reasonable based on the debt levels consistent with maintaining an investment grade credit rating for us. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. During fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, Cardinal Health paid royalties to us under various royalty agreements. During fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, we earned royalty income from Cardinal Health of $233 million, $189 million and $208 million, respectively. As a result of the separation, we no longer receive royalty income from these agreements, as the intellectual property underlying the royalty income remained with Cardinal Health. The combined financial statements also include the push down of certain assets and liabilities that have historically been held at the Cardinal Health corporate level but which are specifically identifiable or otherwise allocable to us. The cash and cash equivalents held by Cardinal Health at the corporate level were not allocated to us for any of the periods presented. Cash and equivalents in our combined balance sheets primarily represent cash held locally by international entities included in our combined financial statements. Transfers of cash to and from Cardinal Healths domestic cash management system are reflected as a component of Parent Company Investment on the combined balance sheets. Cardinal Health maintains self insurance programs at a corporate level. We were allocated a portion of expenses associated with these programs as part of the general corporate overhead expenses. We were not allocated any portion of the related reserves as these reserves represent obligations of Cardinal Health which are not transferable. See note 1 to the audited combined financial statements for additional detail regarding the push down of assets and liabilities, including certain prepaid expenses, property and equipment and employee compensation liabilities. Our combined financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented. See note 14 to the audited combined financial statements for further description of the transactions between Cardinal Health and us. Combined Results of Operations The following table presents, for the periods indicated, selected items from our combined financial statements: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, Change (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs.2008 2008 vs.2007 Revenue $ 4,501 $ 4,518 $ 3,478 % 30 % Gross Margin 1,982 2,046 1,567 (3 )% 31 % Gross Margin Percentage 44.0 % 45.3 % 45.1 % Operating Income 589 725 465 (19 )% 56 % Provision for Income Taxes 151 184 116 (18 )% 59 % Effective Tax Rate 21.0 % 21.8 % 18.8 % Net Income $ 568 $ 663 $ 502 (14 )% 32 % 39 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2009 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2008 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, % of Revenue (in millions) 2009 2008 Change 2009 2008 Revenue $ 4,501 $ 4,518 % Cost of Products Sold 2,519 2,472 2 % 56 % 55 % Gross Margin 1,982 2,046 (3 )% 44 % 45 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 1,155 1,104 5 % 26 % 24 % Research and Development Expenses 165 162 2 % 4 % 4 % Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 73 37 97 % 2 % 1 % Acquired In Process Research and Development 18 (100 )% % % Operating Income 589 725 (19 )% 13 % 16 % Interest Expense and Other, Net (Including Net Interest Expense Allocated from Parent of $80 and $88 for Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, respectively) 103 67 54 % 2 % 1 % Royalty (Income) and Other, Net Received from Parent (233 ) (189 ) 23 % (5 )% (4 )% Income Before Income Taxes 719 847 (15 )% 16 % 19 % Provision for Income Taxes 151 184 (18 )% 3 % 4 % Net Income $ 568 $ 663 (14 )% 13 % 15 % Revenue Total revenue decreased slightly by $17 million to $4,501 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue decline resulted from lower sales volume in our capital equipment businesses ($149 million), as a result of the deferral of capital spending by hospitals and a ship hold on our Alaris infusion devices. Hospitals delayed their capital spending during fiscal 2009 due to the decline in the overall global economic environment, which we believe created uncertainty in regards to access to capital markets and reduced the size of hospital endowments that are utilized to provide funding for capital equipment products. For several months of fiscal 2009, we also placed a hold on shipping the Alaris PCA module and related Alaris PC Unit while we sought FDA clearance for a software correction under the corrective action plan, which we receive in July 2009. As a result of these items, the volume of our capital equipment sales decreased, and overall capital goods products revenues decreased ($149 million). Additionally, revenue declined due to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($118 million) and divestitures ($17 million). Sales transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar comprised approximately 23% and 28% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which the majority is denominated in euros and British pounds. On average during fiscal year 2009, the United States dollar strengthened relative to the euro and British pound by approximately 7% and 26%, respectively. The aforementioned revenue declines were partially offset by revenue increases associated with acquisitions ($170 million), primarily due to our acquisition of Enturia in fiscal year 2008; international growth, exclusive of effects of foreign exchange ($32 million); and new products ($25 million). 40 Table of Contents Segment revenue is shown in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2009 2008 Change Critical Care Technologies $ 2,429 $ 2,603 (7 )% Medical Technologies and Services 2,072 1,915 8 % Revenue $ 4,501 $ 4,518 % Critical Care Technologies segment revenue decreased $174 million, or 7%, to $2,429 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume of capital equipment due to delays in hospital capital spending and the Alaris infusion device ship hold discussed above ($149 million) and the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($59 million), partially offset by increases in revenues associated with new products, largely due to new respiratory ventilator equipment products ($20 million). Medical Technologies and Services segment revenue increased $157 million, or 8%, to $2,072 million, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue increase was primarily due to acquisitions (approximately $170 million); increased sales to existing customers, primarily surgical gloves and one month of year over year revenue growth of the suite of Enturias infection prevention products (combined $50 million); and international revenue growth, excluding effects of foreign exchange rates ($40 million). These increases were partially offset by the negative effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($59 million) and divestitures ($16 million). Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold increased $47 million, or 2%, to $2,519 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products sold increased to 56% in fiscal year 2009 from 55% in fiscal year 2008. The increase in cost of products sold was due to the costs associated with incremental revenues from acquisitions, primarily Enturia; increases in international sales volume; and increases in petroleum based raw materials; partially offset by the decrease in sales volume of capital equipment. Gross Margin For the foregoing reasons, gross margin decreased $64 million, or 3%, to $1,982 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 44% and 45% in fiscal year 2009 and 2008, respectively. During fiscal year 2009, gross margin as a percentage of revenue was negatively affected by international pricing pressure; the effects of foreign exchange, in which the benefits of changes in foreign exchange rates associated with our procurement transactions were more than outweighed by unfavorable impacts associated with sales transactions; and the adverse effects of the under utilization of our capital equipment manufacturing facilities. Partially offsetting these effects were increased sales volumes in certain of our infection prevention and skin preparation businesses and a shift in sales mix favoring disposable products within our Critical Care Technologies segment due to the decline in sales volume of capital equipment. Our infection prevention, skin preparation, and disposable products each recognize higher margins than our other product offerings. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses increased $51 million, or 5%, to $1,155 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. SG&A expenses increased primarily due to 41 Table of Contents acquisitions ($54 million), additional investments in product quality processes ($11 million), and additional provisions for bad debts ($4 million). These increases were partially offset by a decrease due to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($29 million) and a decrease in management incentive compensation expense ($24 million). SG&A expenses allocated by Cardinal Health to us during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 were $406 million and $407 million, respectively. Allocated SG&A expenses include expenses for shared functions, including management, finance, financial shared services, human resources, information technology, legal, legislative affairs and management incentive plan expenses. SG&A expenses historically allocated to us are not likely to be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented or for future periods following our separation from Cardinal Health. Research and Development Research and development expenses increased $3 million, or 2%, to $165 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges Restructuring and acquisition integration charges increased $36 million, or 97%, to $73 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Restructuring and acquisition integration charges incurred in fiscal 2009 were primarily comprised of integration expenses associated with Viasys ($9 million); employee related restructuring costs ($40 million); and facility exit costs ($21 million). In the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, we announced a cost reduction initiative primarily in response to the delay in hospital capital spending and the overall decline in the global economy. Under this initiative, we will reduce our global workforce by approximately 800 people, and eliminate an additional 500 positions through normal attrition and by not filling open roles. In fiscal year 2009, we recorded a $19 million pre tax restructuring charge associated with this cost reduction initiative, included within employee related restructuring costs identified above, and expect to record an additional $14 million pre tax restructuring charge in fiscal year 2010. Restructuring and acquisition integration charges incurred in fiscal 2008 were primarily comprised of integration costs associated with our acquisition of Viasys and restructuring costs related to the closure of a replenishment center, headcount reductions within existing operations and other facility exit costs. Acquired In process Research and Development In connection with our acquisition of certain businesses in fiscal year 2008, we obtained in process research and development projects, or IPR&D. At the time of acquisition, these projects had not yet achieved technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative use and, accordingly, the estimated fair value of the IPR&D was expensed at the acquisition date. During fiscal 2008, we recorded charges to write off our preliminary estimates of fair values of the IPR&D associated with the Enturia acquisition ($18 million), other minor acquisitions ($25 million), and adjusted downward the IPR&D charges initially recorded in fiscal year 2007 associated with the Viasys acquisition based on the final valuation of its related IPR&D in fiscal 2008 ($25 million). Operating Income For the foregoing reasons, operating income decreased $136 million, or 19%, to $589 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13% in fiscal 2009 compared to 16% in the prior fiscal year. 42 Table of Contents Segment profit from our two reporting segments, Critical Care Technologies and Medical Technologies and Services, is shown in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2009 2008 Change Critical Care Technologies $ 402 $ 511 (21 )% Medical Technologies and Services 260 269 (3 )% Segment Profit 662 780 (15 )% Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 73 37 Acquired In Process Research and Development 18 Operating Income $ 589 $ 725 Critical Care Technologies segment profit decreased $109 million, or 21%, to $402 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in segment profit was primarily a result of a lower sales volume of capital equipment due to the delay in hospital capital spending and the Alaris infusion device ship hold ($85 million) and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($22 million). Segment profit as a percentage of segment revenue was 17% and 20% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Medical Technologies and Services segment profit decreased $9 million, or 3%, to $260 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in segment profit was primarily due to increased raw materials costs ($47 million), and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($26 million), partially offset by the profitability of prior year acquisitions ($52 million). Segment profit as a percentage of segment revenue was 13% and 14% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Interest Expense and Other Interest expense and other, net increased $36 million, or 54%, to $103 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest expense and other, net was primarily the result of increases in losses due to changes in foreign exchange rates ($38 million) and decreases in interest income earned ($6 million), partially offset by a reduction in interest expense allocated to us by Cardinal Health ($8 million). Interest expense allocated to us by Cardinal Health totaled $80 million and $88 million in fiscal year 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in allocated interest expense was primarily due to lower levels of debt allocated to us by Cardinal Health. See note 9 to the audited combined financial statements for further information. Royalty Income and Other, Net Received From Parent Royalty income and other, net received from parent increased $44 million, or 23%, to $233 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. As a result of our separation from Cardinal Health, we no longer receive this royalty income, as the intellectual property underlying the royalty income remained with Cardinal Health. Provision for Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, our provision for income taxes decreased $33 million, or 18%, to $151 million, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in income tax expense was due to a reduction in income before income taxes, a decrease related to a claim filed with the IRS to amend our position relative to sales type lease transactions ($24 million), and a decrease for the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the impact of internal reorganizations ($21 million). These decreases in tax are partially offset by an unfavorable tax adjustment for accrued interest related to proposed tax assessments ($9 million), the 43 Table of Contents impact of an increase in our overall state tax rate for the current year before the favorable effect of audit settlements ($6 million), and the impact of nondeductible IPR&D charges in fiscal 2008 ($9 million). As a result of this activity, our effective tax rate decreased slightly to 21.0% in fiscal year 2009 from 21.8% in fiscal year 2008. During the third quarter of 2009, Cardinal Health filed a claim with the IRS to amend the filing position taken on its U.S. federal income tax return for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 related to a secured loan transaction involving certain of our sales type lease receivables. Since our income taxes are presented on a separate return basis, we recognized a $24 million net tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 related to this item. Generally, fluctuations in our effective tax rate are primarily due to changes within international and state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of restructuring and acquisition integration charges and other discrete items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item. The provision for income tax amounts historically calculated is not likely to be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented or for future periods following the separation. Cardinal Health files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. Our operations have historically been included in Cardinal Healths results. With few exceptions, Cardinal Health is subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years ended June 30, 2001 through the current fiscal year. The IRS currently has ongoing audits of fiscal years 2001 through 2007. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, Cardinal Health received an IRS Revenue Agent Report for tax years 2003 through 2005 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in the notice totals $462 million, excluding penalties and interest, which may be significant. We and Cardinal Health disagree with these proposed adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them. Although we believe that we have provided adequate contingent tax reserves for these matters under FIN No. 48, we may not be fully reserved for this matter and it is possible that we may be obligated to pay an amount in excess of the reserve, including the full amount that the IRS is seeking. Under the tax matters agreement between CareFusion and Cardinal Health, the resolution of the matter will be allocated to us. If this matter is not resolved in our favor, it may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For additional detail regarding the provision for income taxes, see note 10 to our audited combined financial statements. Net Income For the foregoing reasons, net income decreased $95 million, or 14%, to $568 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. Net income as a percentage of revenue was 13% and 15% in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. 44 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2007 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, % of Revenue (in millions) 2008 2007 Change 2008 2007 Revenue $ 4,518 $ 3,478 30 % Cost of Products Sold 2,472 1,911 29 % 55 % 55 % Gross Margin 2,046 1,567 31 % 45 % 45 % Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 1,104 890 24 % 24 % 26 % Research and Development Expenses 162 103 57 % 4 % 3 % Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 37 24 54 % 1 % 1 % Acquired In Process Research and Development 18 85 (79 )% % 2 % Operating Income 725 465 56 % 16 % 13 % Interest Expense and Other, Net (Including Net Interest Expense Allocated from Parent of $88 and $72 for Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007, respectively) 67 55 22 % 1 % 2 % Royalty (Income) and Other, Net Received from Parent (189 ) (208 ) (9 )% (4 )% (6 )% Income Before Income Taxes 847 618 37 % 19 % 18 % Provision for Income Taxes 184 116 59 % 4 % 3 % Net Income $ 663 $ 502 32 % 15 % 14 % Revenue Revenue increased $1,040 million, or 30%, to $4,518 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenue growth was favorably affected by acquisitions ($626 million); increased sales volume to existing customers ($154 million); international revenue growth ($130 million), which included the positive effect of foreign exchange rates ($91 million); and new products ($95 million). Segment revenue is shown in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2008 2007 Change Critical Care Technologies $ 2,603 $ 1,905 37 % Medical Technologies and Services 1,915 1,573 22 % Revenue $ 4,518 $ 3,478 30 % Critical Care Technologies segment revenue increased $698 million, or 37%, to $2,603 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was due primarily to acquisitions ($420 million), primarily related to increased sales of respiratory equipment from the Viasys acquisition; increased sales to existing customers ($115 million), largely related to medication dispensing equipment; increased revenue from new products ($73 million) and new customers ($33 million), largely related to new infusion product releases and successful competitive infusion product placements; the favorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($33 million); and financing interest on sales type leases ($14 million). Medical Technologies and Services segment revenue increased $342 million, or 22%, to $1,915 million, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Acquisitions increased revenue by $206 million, primarily related to increased sales of neurological diagnostic equipment from the Viasys 45 Table of Contents acquisition and infection prevention products from the Enturia acquisition. Revenue also increased from sales to existing customers ($39 million), sales of new products ($22 million), including domestic surgical gloves and medical specialties products, as well as an increase in international revenue ($101 million), primarily across Europe, which included the favorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($59 million). Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold increased $561 million, or 29%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Cost of products sold increased primarily due to acquisitions ($334 million), primarily related to the Viasys acquisition; the aforementioned increases in sales to existing customers and new products ($139 million); and the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($43 million). In addition, our Medical Technologies and Services segment experienced increases in the costs of petroleum based raw materials ($8 million) and our Critical Care Technologies segment experienced increased costs associated with infusion product recalls ($4 million). Gross Margin For the foregoing reasons, gross margin increased $479 million, or 31%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45% in each year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased $214 million, or 24%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to acquisitions ($192 million); the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign exchange rates ($21 million); and increased variable costs associated with our revenue growth, partially offset by decreases in equity based and other variable compensation ($21 million); and a decrease in SG&A expenses allocated to us by Cardinal Health ($21 million). SG&A expenses allocated by Cardinal Health to us during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2008 and 2007 were $407 million and $428 million, respectively. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue was 24% and 26% for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Research and Development R&D expenses increased $59 million, or 57%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to acquisitions ($40 million), primarily the Viasys acquisition, and increased spending on innovation ($9 million). Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges Restructuring and acquisition integration charges increased $13 million to $37 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to increased acquisition integration charges ($16 million) partially offsetting a reduction in restructuring charges ($3 million). The acquisition integration charges incurred during fiscal 2008 were primarily a result of the acquisition of Viasys ($24 million). The acquisition integration charges incurred during fiscal 2007 were primarily a result of the acquisition of Viasys ($8 million). Restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2008 related to the closure of a replenishment center, headcount reductions within existing operations and other facility exit costs. The restructuring costs incurred for fiscal 2007 related to facility closures, a global restructuring program initiated in fiscal 2005 and projects aimed at improvements in manufacturing cost and efficiency. See note 3 to the audited combined financial statements for additional detail regarding these restructuring and acquisition integration charges. 46 Table of Contents Acquired In process Research and Development In connection with our acquisition of certain businesses in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, we obtained in process research and development projects, or IPR&D. At the time of acquisition, these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative use and, accordingly, the estimated fair value of the IPR&D was expensed at the acquisition date. These projects primarily related to the following areas: Infection prevention (acquired in connection with the fiscal 2008 acquisition of Enturia); Respiratory therapy diagnostic instruments and ventilation products (acquired in connection with the fiscal 2007 acquisition of Viasys); and Surgical devices (acquired in connection with the 2008 acquisition of other businesses that were individually not significant). IPR&D decreased $67 million to $18 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2008, we recorded charges to write off our preliminary estimates of fair values of the IPR&D associated with the Enturia acquisition ($18 million) and other acquisitions ($25 million). During fiscal 2008, we finalized the valuation of the IPR&D associated with the Viasys acquisition and recorded an adjustment ($25 million) to reduce the cumulative IPR&D charge associated with the Viasys acquisition to $59 million. During fiscal 2007, we recorded a charge to write off our preliminary estimate of the fair value of the IPR&D associated with the Viasys acquisition ($84 million). The fair value of the IPR&D was determined using the discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow was determined based upon projected revenue, expenses and contributory assets related to the specific project and a discount rate based upon the overall weighted average cost of capital for the asset and the additional risk related to the uncertainty of the project. We also assessed the current status of development, nature and timing of efforts to complete such development, uncertainties, and other factors when estimating the fair value. Costs were not assigned to IPR&D unless future development was probable. At the time of acquisition, the in process projects were at various stages of completion with some requiring several years to reach commercialization. The estimated cost to complete the projects at the date of the acquisitions was $33 million. The majority of the technology has not yet come to fruition as it is still in process; however, completion is expected for all projects by the end of calendar year 2011. See note 2 to the audited combined financial statements for additional detail regarding acquired IPR&D. Operating Income For the foregoing reasons, operating income increased $260 million, or 56%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 16% from 13% in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. Segment profit from our two reporting segments, Critical Care Technologies and Medical Technologies and Services, is shown in the table below: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2008 2007 Change Critical Care Technologies $ 511 $ 345 48 % Medical Technologies and Services 269 229 17 % Segment Profit 780 574 36 % Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 37 24 Acquired In Process Research and Development 18 85 Operating Income $ 725 $ 465 47 Table of Contents Critical Care Technologies segment profit increased $166 million, or 48%, to $511 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit was primarily a result of the profitability associated with acquisitions ($38 million); favorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($16 million); and the remainder due primarily to earnings associated with non acquisition related revenue growth. Segment profit as a percentage of revenue was 20% and 18% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Medical Technologies and Services segment profit increased $40 million, or 17%, to $269 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit was primarily a result of profitability associated with acquisitions ($22 million); favorable changes in foreign exchange rates ($11 million); and the earnings associated with the increases in sales to existing customers and new products. Segment profit as a percentage of revenue was 14% and 15% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Interest Expense and Other Interest expense and other increased $12 million, or 22%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest expense ($14 million) primarily resulting from increased levels of debt allocated to us by Cardinal Health. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, interest expense allocated to us by Cardinal Health was $88 million and $72 million, respectively. Royalty Income and Other, Net Received From Parent Royalty income and other, net received from parent decreased $19 million, or 9%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. As a result of the separation, the intellectual property underlying the royalty income remained with Cardinal Health. Provision for Income Taxes For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, our provision for income taxes increased $68 million, or 59%, to $184 million, compared to the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was 21.8% compared to 18.8% for the prior fiscal year. The increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate was due to an increase in the overall proportion of domestic income which is taxed at higher rates than foreign income ($91 million), and a revaluation of state deferred tax assets and liabilities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 ($17 million). These increases were partially offset by the effect of a one time permanent difference during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 for non deductible IPR&D associated with the Viasys acquisition ($40 million). Net Income For the foregoing reasons, net income increased $161 million, or 32%, to $663 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. Net income as a percentage of revenue was 15% and 14% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Historically, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, positive cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations primarily represents inflows from net income (adjusted for depreciation and other non cash items) and outflows from investment in sales type leases entered into, as we sell and install dispensing equipment, and other increases in working capital needed to grow the business. Cash flows from investing 48 Table of Contents activities represent our investment in intellectual property and capital equipment required to grow, as well as acquisitions. Cash flows from financing activities are primarily changes in Cardinal Healths investment in us. In the past, Cardinal Health would fund our operating and investing activities as needed and transfer our excess cash at its discretion. Transfers of cash both to and from Cardinal Healths cash management system are reflected as a component of Parent Company Investment within Parent Company Equity in the combined balance sheets. As a result of our separation from Cardinal Health, our capital structure, long term capital commitments and sources of liquidity have changed significantly from our historical capital structure as described herein. In addition, we will no longer receive cash from Cardinal Health to fund our operating or investing needs. Instead, our ability to fund our capital needs will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, overall capacity and terms of financing arrangements, and access to the capital markets. We believe that our future cash from operations together with our access to funds available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities and the capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and new business development activities. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table summarizes our statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, 2008, and 2007: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash Flow Provided by/(Used in) Operating Activities $ 803 $ 886 $ 520 Investing Activities $ (154 ) $ (773 ) $ (1,722 ) Financing Activities $ (421 ) $ (250 ) $ 1,681 Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $83 million to $803 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income, after adjustment for non cash items ($195 million); reduced cash flows associated with other accrued liabilities and operating items ($28 million), primarily consisting of cash outflows related to employee related accrued liabilities, and merger and restructuring liabilities. These reductions in operating cash flows were partially offset by increased cash flows from collections of accounts receivable ($87 million) and sales type capital leases ($88 million). Net cash used in investing activities decreased $619 million to $154 million compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily related to the cash purchase price of Enturia in fiscal 2008 ($476 million) and reductions in capital expenditures ($60 million). The net cash used in financing for both years was primarily the result of net cash transfers to and from Cardinal Health. Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $366 million to $886 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to the increase in net income, after adjustments for non cash items ($239 million); and increased cash inflows associated with trade receivables and inventories ($157 million). Reductions in inventory balances were the result of significant efforts made in fiscal 2008 to reduce inventory on hand within our Medical Technologies and Services segment. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $949 million to $773 million for the same period, primarily related to differences in purchase price for Enturia in fiscal 2008 compared to Viasys in fiscal 2007 and additional capital expenditures. The net cash used in financing for both years was primarily the result of net cash transfers to and from Cardinal Health. 49 Table of Contents Capital Resources Cardinal Health uses a centralized approach to U.S. domestic cash management and financing of its operations, excluding debt directly incurred by any of its businesses, such as debt assumed in an acquisition or certain capital lease obligations. Prior to the separation, the majority of our domestic cash was transferred to Cardinal Health daily, and Cardinal Health funded our operating and investing activities as needed. Accordingly, a portion of Cardinal Healths consolidated debt has been allocated to us based on our debt capacity consistent with an investment grade credit rating, including amounts directly incurred. Cardinal Healths historical long term debt balances were allocated to us based on a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, which, based on discussions with external advisors and comparisons with BBB rated companies in the S&P 500, is consistent with an investment grade credit rating. This allocation methodology is also generally consistent with managements long term capital structure plans for CareFusion as a separate, stand alone company. In contrast, short term debt balances (e.g., commercial paper, bank loans) held at the corporate level were not allocated down to CareFusion as this debt was issued to fund the operations of the Cardinal Health healthcare supply chain services businesses. As both CareFusion and Cardinal Health have established post spin capital structures that support investment grade credit ratings, we believe that utilizing financial metric targets to allocate historical third party debt is reasonable and appropriate. Total debt at June 30, 2009 was $1,289 million, of which $1,281 million was due to Cardinal Health. Total debt at June 30, 2008 was $1,609 million, of which $1,597 million was due to Cardinal Health. We believe that the allocation basis for debt is reasonable based on our debt capacity consistent with an investment grade credit rating. However, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Our cash and equivalents balance as of June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, included $767 million and $568 million of cash, respectively, held by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Although the vast majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, doing so on more than a temporary basis could subject it to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. Bridge Loan Facility. In connection with the separation, On July 1, 2009, we entered into a senior unsecured bridge loan facility (the bridge loan facility) to provide financing for an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, with a term of 364 days from the date of any funding, for payment of the distribution to Cardinal Health as part of our spinoff. As the senior unsecured note offering (see below) was successfully completed prior to the separation, those proceeds were used to finance the payment of the distribution to Cardinal Health in lieu of drawing the bridge loan facility. As a result, the bridge loan facility was terminated on August 31, 2009. Revolving Credit Facilities. On July 1, 2009, we also entered into two senior unsecured revolving credit facilities with an aggregate principal amount of $720 million, with commitments thereunder allocated as follows: $240 million 364 day revolving credit facility; and $480 million three year revolving credit facility. The commitments under the three year revolving credit facility are subject to increase, upon our request and consent by the lenders, by up to an aggregate of $30 million, subject to certain conditions and commitments. Borrowings under the three year revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate per annum based upon the London interbank offered rate for dollars (LIBOR) or the alternate base rate (ABR), in each case, plus an applicable margin, which in the case of LIBOR varies from 2.1% to 3.375% depending on CareFusions debt ratings and in the case of ABR varies from 1.1% to 2.375% depending on CareFusions debt ratings. Borrowings under the 364 day revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate per annum based upon LIBOR or ABR, in each case, plus an applicable margin, which in the case of LIBOR varies from 2.2% to 3.5% based upon CareFusions debt ratings and in the case of ABR varies from 1.2% to 2.5% based upon CareFusions debt ratings. All obligations under the revolving credit facilities will continue to be guaranteed by each of our existing and future direct and indirect material domestic subsidiaries. 50 Table of Contents The revolving credit facilities contain several customary covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, investments, dispositions, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, and sale and lease back transactions. The revolving credit facilities also contain financial covenants requiring CareFusion to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.00:1.00 at any time during any period of four fiscal quarters, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter of at least (i) 3.25:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ended on September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009, (ii) 3.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended on March 31, 2010, and (iii) 3.75:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ended on June 30, 2010 and thereafter. The revolving credit facilities are subject to customary events of default, including, but not limited to, non payment of principal or other amounts when due, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross default to other material indebtedness, certain ERISA related events, certain voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy events, and change of control. We currently do not anticipate utilizing our revolving credit facilities for current operations as we believe that our anticipated cash flows will be sufficient. However, based on operating needs, strategic planning and other factors, we may utilize the revolving credit facilities in the future. Senior Unsecured Notes. On July 14, 2009, we offered and sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The notes consist of the following tranches: $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2012; $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2014; and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2019. The net proceeds of the offering were placed into an escrow account and were subsequently used to finance the distribution payment to Cardinal Health of approximately $1.4 billion related to our spinoff. The 2012 notes will mature on August 1, 2012, the 2014 notes will mature on August 1, 2014 and the 2019 notes will mature on August 1, 2019. In each case, interest will be paid on each February 1 and August 1, commencing February 1, 2010. The indenture for the senior notes limits our ability to incur certain secured debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. In accordance with the indenture, we may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or the sum of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest in respect of the senior notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption) discounted to its present value, on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360 day year consisting of twelve 30 day months) at an adjusted treasury rate plus 45 basis points in the case of the 2012 notes, 45 basis points in the case of the 2014 notes and 50 basis points in the case of the 2019 notes, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the amount being redeemed to the date of redemption. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and experience a below investment grade rating event, each as defined in the senior notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes repurchased to the date of repurchase. Dividends We currently intend to retain any income to finance research and development, acquisitions and the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any dividends in the future by us will be subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, income, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Moreover, if we determine to pay any dividend in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends. 51 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2009, our contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows: Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Long Term Debt1,7 $ 129 $ 296 $ 107 $ 754 $ 1,286 Capital Lease Obligations2 1 2 3 Other Long Term Liabilities3 17 20 7 1 45 Interest on Long Term Debt4,7 65 113 88 156 422 Operating Leases5 35 56 44 51 186 Purchase Obligations6 178 24 2 204 Total Financial Obligations $ 425 $ 511 $ 248 $ 962 $ 2,146 1 Represents maturities of our long term debt obligations, excluding capital lease obligations described below, as described in note 9 to the audited combined financial statements. 2 Represents maturities of our capital lease obligations included within long term debt on CareFusions balance sheet and the related estimated future interest payments. 3 Represents cash outflows by period for certain of our long term liabilities in which cash outflows could be reasonably estimated. Certain long term liabilities, such as unrecognized tax benefits of $271 million and deferred taxes of $575 million, have been excluded from the table above because of the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflow. See note 10 to the audited combined financial statements for additional information. 4 Interest obligation is calculated based on each outstanding debt stated or coupon rate, or existing variable rate as of June 30, 2009, as applicable. 5 Represents minimum rental payments and the related estimated future interest payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms as described in note 11 to the audited combined financial statements. 6 Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including the following: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. In addition, contracts that can be unilaterally cancelled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period. 7 Included within Long Term Debt and Interest on Long Term Debt are $1,281 million of long term debt and $421 million of interest expense associated with debt allocated to us from Cardinal Health. See note 9 to the audited combined financial statements for additional information. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements See note 18 to the audited combined financial statements for a discussion of off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical 52 Table of Contents accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant effect on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience, trends, and managements judgment. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and believe our estimates to be reasonable. Other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our combined financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see note 1 to our audited combined financial statements. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue through the sale and lease of equipment, software, services, medical products, supplies, and the income associated with the financing of our equipment leases. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB No. 104), we recognize revenue when each of the following criteria exists: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; product delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends on a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized may involve subjective or complex judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. The significant judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and could result in material differences under other assumptions and conditions are those described below. Evaluation of the Significance of Embedded Software We sell and lease products with embedded software. We regularly review these products to determine whether embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole. If the embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole, the product is classified as a software product and revenue for the product is recognized in accordance with the provisions of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position, or SOP, No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition (SOP No. 97 2). In classifying our products, we consider the following characteristics to be indicators that embedded software is more than incidental to the product as whole: software is a significant focus of the marketing effort or the software application is sold separately; significant internally developed software costs have been incurred; and if we provide telephone support, bug fixes, and or unspecified upgrades specific to the embedded software. The evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment as the products exhibit varying degrees of the indicators identified above, such as: certain products are marketed as systems or solutions wherein it is implied, but not explicitly stated within marketing and sales collateral, that embedded software provides the basis for significant functionalities identified within the marketing efforts; internal software development costs are incurred during the product development process; separately priced extended warranty services provide post installation support relative to repair parts 53 Table of Contents and services and also include telephone support and bug fixes for the software embedded within the products; and we are required by law to provide medical safety related bug fixes for products with embedded software elements. We classify our infusion products, when sold with safety software, and patient identification products as software. We have determined the embedded software within our other products, primarily our dispensing and respiratory products, is incidental to the products as a whole. Those products are therefore not classified as software. Product development trends indicate that embedded software, connectivity and interfacing with hospital information systems will continue to be components of, and possibly significant features of, future product releases. In the future, the embedded software inherent to these future products may be determined to be more than incidental to the product and as a result the product may be classified as software for revenue recognition purposes. If these future software products are sold with extended payment terms or subject to long term leases, the timing of revenue recognition for these products could change significantly as compared to similar transactions with hardware products. Specifically, we may be unable to determine the associated payments are fixed or determinable and, as a result, we may be precluded from recognizing revenue upon the completion of installation services as we would for a hardware product. Instead, we may be required to recognize revenue on these software products over time as payments become due from the customer. Revenue Recognition for Leases Our accounting for leases involves specific determinations under applicable lease accounting standards, which often involve complex and prescriptive provisions. If a lease qualifies as a sales type capital lease, equipment revenue is recognized upon delivery or installation of the equipment as opposed to ratably over the lease term. Therefore, our lease classification procedures significantly affect the timing of revenue recognition. The critical element considered by us in determining the classification of our lease transactions is the fair value of the leased equipment, including its estimated fair value at the inception and conclusion of the lease. For the purposes of determining the fair value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease, we apply the percentage discount from rental list prices provided within the lease transaction against the purchase list price. This methodology assumes that purchase customers are provided similar discounts as lease customers. Periodically, we review discount levels provided to purchase customers and lease customers to validate this assumption. Multiple Element Arrangements The majority of our transactions qualify as multiple element arrangements. We use the relative fair value method to allocate contract proceeds to each unit of accounting, which are then individually recognized to revenue. To the extent that fair value evidence does not exist for delivered elements of the transaction, we apply the residual method. Determination as to whether fair value exists and the valuation of our fair value estimates are critical to both the relative fair value method and residual method. The determination of fair value estimates associated with our products and services is generally based on historical evidence of sales of the same product in stand alone transactions and the contract renewal prices for post contract support and separately priced extended warranty services. For software and software related products, evidence used in the determination of fair value estimates are based solely on vendor specific objective evidence. Third party fair value evidence may be used for non software products. 54 Table of Contents Different conclusions as to the existence and valuation of fair value estimates may significantly affect the timing and valuation of revenue recognition, the classification of leasing transactions, and the classification of revenue as product, service, rental or other income. It is impossible to determine the effects of potential different conclusions as they relate to the existence or valuation of fair value estimates. Business Combinations Assumptions and estimates are used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets, which requires management to use significant judgment in determining fair value. Current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is affected by purchase price allocations and by the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles, excluding goodwill. We believe the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. In conjunction with the review of a transaction, the status of the acquired companys research and development projects is assessed to determine the existence of IPR&D. In connection with certain acquisitions, we are required to estimate the fair value of acquired IPR&D, which requires selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project. Management also assesses the current status of development, nature and timing of efforts to complete such development, uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value. Costs are not assigned to IPR&D unless future development is probable. Once the fair value is determined, an asset is established, and in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method (FIN No. 4), is immediately written off in our combined statement of income. During fiscal 2008, we reversed $25 million of a previously recorded write off of IPR&D costs associated with the acquisition of Viasys, as a result of the finalization of the Viasys purchase price allocation process and recorded charges of $18 million related to the write off of IPR&D costs associated with Enturia. During fiscal 2007, we recorded charges of $84 million and $1 million primarily related to the write off of IPR&D costs associated with Viasys (see note 2 to our audited combined financial statements). In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date within fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141(R) changes many aspects of business combinations, and could significantly influence how we pursue future business combinations. See note 1 to the audited combined financial statements for further information. Goodwill and Other Intangibles We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). Under SFAS No. 142, purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily trademarks and patents, continue to be amortized over their useful lives. In conducting the impairment test, the fair value of our reporting units is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to assess impairment. We perform our impairment testing at the operating segment level as defined in SFAS No. 142 because all of the components of each operating segment are similar and none of their components are reporting units. Our determination of fair value of the reporting units is based on a discounted cash flow analysis. The discount rates used for impairment testing are based on the risk free rate plus an adjustment for risk factors. Our impairment review process uses estimates of future revenue for the reporting units, driven by assumed market growth rates and projected operating margins. These estimates are consistent with the plans and assumptions that we use to manage the underlying businesses. 55 Table of Contents Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units. The use of alternative estimates, changes in the industry or adjusting the discount rate could affect the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in impairment. Any identified impairment would result in an adjustment to our results of operations. We performed our annual impairment tests as of March 31, 2009, from which the fair value for each reporting segment exceeded the carrying value in our testing, therefore further analysis was not required and we did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges. If the carrying value had exceeded the fair value, we would have performed further analysis, comparing the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit to the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. The most significant input in our discounted cash flow model is the discount rate. Increasing the discount rate by 1 percentage point would not have indicated impairment for any of our reporting units. See note 7 to our audited combined financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangibles. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges We separately identify restructuring and acquisition integration charges in SG&A expenses. A restructuring activity is a program whereby we fundamentally change our operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Restructuring charges are recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146). Under SFAS No. 146, a liability is measured at its fair value and recognized as incurred. Acquisition integration charges include costs to integrate acquired companies. Upon acquisition, certain integration charges are included within the purchase price allocation in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141), and other integration charges are recorded as special items as incurred. The majority of the charges related to restructuring and acquisition integration can be classified in one of the following categories: employee related costs, exit costs (including lease termination costs), asset impairments, IPR&D costs, and other integration costs. Employee related costs include severance and termination benefits. Lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees, forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income. Other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility. Asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of our assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities. IPR&D costs include the write off of research and development projects in process at the time of acquisition, which had not yet reached technological feasibility and were deemed to have no alternative use. Other integration costs primarily include charges directly related to the integration plan such as consulting costs related to information systems and employee benefit plans as well as relocation and travel costs directly associated with the integration plan. See note 3 to our audited financial statements for additional information. Provision for Income Taxes Our income taxes as presented are calculated on a separate tax return basis, although our operations have historically been included in Cardinal Healths U.S. federal and state tax returns or non U.S. jurisdictions tax returns. Cardinal Healths global tax model has been developed based on its entire portfolio of businesses. Accordingly, our tax results as presented are not necessarily reflective of the results that we would have generated on a stand alone basis. 56 Table of Contents With the exception of certain dedicated foreign entities, we do not maintain taxes payable to/from our parent and we are deemed to settle the annual current tax balances immediately with the legal tax paying entities in the respective jurisdictions. These settlements are reflected as changes in Parent Company Investment. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and measurement of uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the combined financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. We had deferred income tax assets before valuation allowances of $299 million and $289 million as of June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008, respectively. We also had deferred income tax liabilities of $852 million and $894 million as of June 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At June 30, 2009, we had gross federal, state and international loss and credit carryforwards of $5 million, $209 million and $54 million, respectively, the tax effect of which is an aggregate deferred tax asset of $38 million. Substantially all of these carryforwards are available for at least three years or have an indefinite carryforward period. The valuation allowance of $22 million at June 30, 2009 applies to certain federal, international, and state and local carryforwards that, in the opinion of management, are more likely than not to expire unutilized. However, to the extent that tax benefits related to these carryforwards are realized in the future, the reduction in the valuation allowance would be applied against income tax expense. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and measurement of uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. However, other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate, and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN No. 48). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109). This standard provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognizing benefits, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosures. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, Cardinal Health received an IRS Revenue Agents Report for the tax years 2003 through 2005 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in these notices totals $462 million, excluding penalties and interest, which may be significant. We and Cardinal Health disagree with the IRS regarding the application of the U.S. Treasury regulations to the arrangements under review and the valuations underlying such adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them. The proper transfer price to be charged among subsidiaries and the value of intellectual property transferred among subsidiaries are subjective determinations that depend on the specific facts and circumstances at issue. Management estimated a contingent tax reserve for these issues by first concluding that our positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The reserve was then determined by evaluating and weighing the technical merits of alternative valuation methodologies against each other and concluding on the positions that provide the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate resolution. To the extent there are any administrative or case law developments that provide additional evidence in favor or against the valuation methodologies utilized, the contingent tax reserve will be adjusted in the period that such developments occur. 57 Table of Contents Since it is not currently possible to predict whether and when any of these events will occur, we are unable to quantify potential changes. Although we believe that we have provided an appropriate contingent tax reserve for these matters under FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 48, we may not be fully reserved for this matter and it is possible that we may be obligated to pay an amount in excess of the reserve, including the full amount that the IRS is seeking. Any such obligation could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Loss Contingencies We accrue for contingencies related to litigation and other claims arising out of our business in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS No. 5) which requires us to assess contingencies to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in our combined financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these claims are often inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Share Based Compensation Cardinal Health maintains certain share based compensation plans that enable Cardinal Health to grant awards to all employees, including our employees, in the form of Cardinal Health equity based instruments. During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Cardinal Health adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), applying the modified prospective method. This statement requires all equity based payments to employees, including grants of options, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of income based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair values of options granted after Cardinal Health adopted this statement were determined using a lattice valuation model, whereas all options granted prior to adoption of this statement were valued using a Black Scholes model. Our estimate of an options fair value depends on a complex estimation process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events. These events, estimates of which are entered within the option valuation model include, but are not limited to, stock price volatility, the expected option life, expected dividend yield and option forfeiture rates. Effective with all options granted subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we estimate our future stock price volatility based on implied volatility from traded options on Cardinal Healths common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant (7 years). We analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to estimate the expected option life and forfeiture rates. We calculated separate option valuations for three separate groups of employees with similar historical exercise behaviors. Once employee stock option values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results. SFAS No. 123(R) requires us, however, to compare our estimated option forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary. See note 17 to our audited combined financial statements for additional information regarding share based compensation. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 157. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, No. FAS 157 2 Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP FAS 157 2), which delayed the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within 58 Table of Contents those fiscal years. We adopted SFAS No. 157 for its financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, which did not result in recognition of a transaction adjustment to retained earnings or have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We will adopt the provisions for nonfinancial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. SFAS No. 161. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities, including (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments; (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133; and (iii) how derivative instruments and the related hedged item affect an entitys results of operations, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We adopted SFAS No. 161 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Since SFAS No. 161 is a disclosure standard, this adoption did not have any impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. SFAS No. 165. In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events (SFAS No. 165). This statement provides guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. This statement is effective for interim or fiscal periods ending after June 15, 2009, and is applied prospectively. We adopted SFAS No. 165 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009; this adoption did not have any impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Currency Risk Management By nature of our global operations, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates. Our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Canadian dollar. We have historically used derivative financial instruments indirectly through our participation in the centralized hedging program of Cardinal Health, which are designed to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk. Cardinal Health did not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. As an independent company, we are currently evaluating our exposures and designing our hedging strategy following the separation. We anticipate that in the future we will also implement a program based on the use of a combination of financial derivatives such as forward contracts and options to manage our foreign exchange risk. See notes 1 and 13 to the audited combined financial statements for more information on historical foreign currency risk management. Interest Rate Risk Management Changes in interest rates can impact us in several ways. The return we earn on investing our cash is based on floating interest rates, and changes in rates have a direct impact on our interest income. Our primary source of debt capital is currently at fixed rates and as a result, we have a net exposure to changes in interest rates. We expect to review our exposure and sensitivity to changes in interest rates following separation from Cardinal Health. In the event we decide to change our risk profile, we will likely use financial derivatives such as interest rate swaps to adjust our exposure to changes in rates. Commodity Price Risk Management We purchase commodities such as latex, heating oil, diesel fuel and polystyrene, among others for use in our manufacturing processes. We typically purchase these commodities at market prices, and as a result, are affected by market price fluctuations. We have historically, performed a sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposures for the following fiscal year, but have chosen to not hedge these exposures as they were deemed to be insignificant. 59 Table of Contents
