BUSINESS Overview We are a global medical technology company with clinically proven and industry leading products and services designed to measurably improve the safety, quality, efficiency and cost of healthcare. Our offerings include established brands used in hospitals throughout the United States and more than 130 countries worldwide. We offer comprehensive product lines in the areas of intravenous (IV) infusion, medication and supply dispensing, respiratory care, infection prevention and surgical instruments. Our primary product brands include: Alaris IV infusion systems that feature our proprietary Guardrails software, an application that alerts the clinician when a parameter is outside the institutions pre established limitations for that medication, thereby helping to reduce IV medication errors; Pyxis automated medication dispensing systems that provide comprehensive medication management and Pyxis automated medical supply dispensing systems; AVEA and Pulmonetic Systems ventilation and respiratory products, and Jaeger and SensorMedics pulmonary products; ChloraPrep skin antiseptic products and MedMined software and surveillance services that help target healthcare associated infections (HAIs); and V. Mueller surgical instruments and related products and services. For each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, we generated revenue of $3.5 billion. We generated income from continuing operations of $291 million in fiscal year 2011 and $158 million in fiscal year 2010. Approximately 20% of our fiscal year 2011 revenue was from customers outside of the United States. Separation from Cardinal Health We were incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 2009 for the purpose of holding Cardinal Health, Inc.s clinical and medical products businesses in anticipation of spinning off from Cardinal Health. We completed the spinoff from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health contributed the majority of the businesses comprising its clinical and medical products segment to us (the contribution) and distributed approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 179.8 million shares, to its shareholders (the distribution). Cardinal Health retained approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 41.4 million shares, in connection with the spinoff. As of September 15, 2010, Cardinal Health had sold all remaining shares of our common stock retained in connection with the spinoff. Until our separation from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009, CareFusion Corporation was a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardinal Health. Accordingly, our historical financial information for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 and prior years does not reflect our results as a separate, stand alone company. In this Annual Report on Form 10 K, we describe the businesses contributed to us by Cardinal Health in the spinoff as if they were our businesses for all historical periods described. References in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to our historical assets, liabilities, products, businesses or activities of our business are generally intended to refer to the historical assets, liabilities, products, businesses or activities of the contributed businesses, as conducted as part of Cardinal Health and its subsidiaries prior to the spinoff. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health retained certain lines of business that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the United States markets that were historically managed by us prior to the spinoff, which were part of the clinical and medical products businesses of Cardinal Health. These lines of businesses are reflected in the financial information included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K as discontinued operations. 1 Table of Contents Our Strengths We possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, including: Scale and focus. We are one of the largest medical technology companies in the world, with long standing customer relationships, a global presence, and a focus on helping clinicians improve patient safety. The prevalence and magnitude of medical errors and HAIs have put patient safety among the top issues for hospitals, regulators and payers in the United States and increasingly, worldwide. We believe that we are well positioned to address these global quality and patient safety needs by providing products and services that help hospitals and other healthcare providers prevent medication errors, reduce infections, and manage medications and supplies more efficiently. Technology leadership and innovation. We have a long history of innovation and developing products and services that enable our customers to deliver safer and more cost effective patient care. We pioneered the concept of a smart infusion pump that alerts the clinician when a parameter is outside the institutions pre established limitations for that medication, and we created the market for medication dispensing machines that automate the management of medications from the pharmacy to the nursing unit. We have also integrated our products with other information systems within the hospital, including financial and business systems that support patient admissions, discharges and transfers, operational systems that include inventory management and clinical systems that include pharmacy information and electronic medical records. We were the first to integrate automated supply dispensing systems with clinical information systems that enable clinicians to chart, charge and reorder supplies with the touch of a button. Today, we have an extensive library of healthcare information system interfaces, with almost 17,000 distinct interfaces to almost 300 vendor systems in almost 3,500 facilities domestically. These interfaces allow us to integrate our products with any of the major information technology products in healthcare. In the respiratory care arena, we have strong positions with technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary and sleep related disorders. We believe that our strong heritage of leadership and innovation provides us with a solid foundation for the continued development of safe and cost effective products that will enable us to continue to grow our revenue. Industry expertise. We employ a wide range of experienced clinical professionals, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists, who bring a detailed understanding of how providers use our products and the current state of clinical practice, including best practices for infusion, medication management, infection prevention and respiratory therapy. These experts enable us to develop innovative and industry leading products and services because of their in depth understanding of the medical and clinical protocols for our products. Focus on customer service. As of June 30, 2011, we employed more than 800 sales people in the United States and over 1,300 field, clinical and technical service personnel. We work with our customers to optimize their workflow as we meet their equipment needs, allowing them to deliver the highest level of patient care and reduce operating costs. We provide on site clinical and technical support, product effectiveness tracking and customer training to provide the support necessary to maximize medication safety. Strategy We seek to grow our business by, among other things: Focusing on healthcare safety and productivity. We intend to continue to address the global priority of quality and patient safety by providing products and services that help hospitals and other healthcare providers prevent medication errors, reduce infections and manage medications and supplies more efficiently, which helps to reduce overall costs for our customers. Productivity and safety are rapidly becoming the standards by which healthcare providers are measured and compensated. We intend to continue to expand our product portfolio with additional and enhanced products and services that enable hospitals and other healthcare providers to reduce medication errors and overall treatment costs. 2 Table of Contents Focusing on innovative and proven products. With hospitals and other healthcare providers increasingly adopting outcome based standards as a key part of their decision making processes, we will offer additional and enhanced products and services that demonstrate clinical differentiation by providing solutions with simple and compelling economic benefits. We intend to increase our investment in research and development to bring to market products that make it easy for providers to follow evidence based protocols in patient care. In fiscal year 2011, we introduced 19 new or enhanced products, and our innovation pipeline includes numerous additional new or enhanced products that are expected to be launched in the next few years. Accelerating global growth. Our industry leading positions in the United States markets in which we currently operate provide us with a platform for growth outside of the United States. Because our products and technologies have similar applications around the world, we intend to focus on expanding our operations in select developed and emerging markets outside the United States. We also intend to invest in expanding our research and development capabilities to better tailor products to the needs of markets outside the United States. Pursuing strategic opportunities. We intend to continue to explore organic growth, strategic alliances and acquisition opportunities that enable us to address our customers key concerns of productivity and medication safety. We intend to selectively pursue strategic opportunities that give us access to innovative technologies, complementary product lines or new markets, yet remain consistent with our focus on productivity and safety. Our business strategy also involves assessing our portfolio of businesses with a view of divesting non core businesses and product lines that do not align with our objectives. Acquisitions and Dispositions Our business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions by Cardinal Health of established healthcare companies. Since our separation from Cardinal Health, we have taken steps to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and to divest non core businesses. During fiscal year 2010, we acquired Medegen, a manufacturer of clinically differentiated IV needleless access valves and administration sets, and during fiscal year 2011, we acquired Vestara, a developer of technology solutions that enable the safe, efficient disposal and tracking of environmentally sensitive pharmaceutical waste. In August 2011, we completed our acquisition of Rowa, a Germany based company specializing in robotic medication storage and retrieval systems for retail and hospital pharmacies. In addition, during fiscal year 2010, we divested our Audiology business and our Research Services business, and during fiscal year 2011, we divested our International Surgical Products business and our Onsite Services business. The results of our Audiology business and our International Surgical Products business are reflected in discontinued operations in the financial information included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Business Segments Our business consists of two reporting segments: Critical Care Technologies and Medical Technologies and Services. Critical Care Technologies includes our infusion, dispensing and respiratory care businesses that develop, manufacture and sell capital equipment and related dedicated and non dedicated disposables. Medical Technologies and Services includes our infection prevention and medical specialties products and services businesses that develop, manufacture and sell primarily single use, disposable products and reusable surgical instruments. See note 18 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for certain segment financial data relating to our business. In July 2011, we made a decision to realign our businesses to reduce complexity, provide clearer governance for our investments and make it easier for our customers to do business with us. Our businesses will be organized into two new global operating segments aligned around our capital equipment businesses, which will be called our Medical Systems segment, and our disposable products businesses, which will be called our Procedural Solutions segment. 3 Table of Contents There were no changes to our reportable segments for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 as a result of these changes. Our periodic filings beginning with our Form 10 Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, will reflect the effect of this realignment. Critical Care Technologies Segment In our Critical Care Technologies (CCT) segment, we develop, manufacture and market equipment and related supplies for infusion, medication and supply dispensing and respiratory care. We believe our products enable healthcare professionals to improve patient safety by reducing medication errors and improving administrative controls, while simultaneously improving workflow and increasing operational efficiency. This segment primarily sells capital equipment and related dedicated and non dedicated disposable products. We sell these products primarily through our direct sales force, but use third party distributors as well, particularly outside the United States. Our products in this segment are integrated with other information systems within the hospital, including financial and business systems that support patient admissions, discharges and transfers, operational systems that include inventory management and clinical systems that include pharmacy information and electronic medical records. Today, we have an extensive library of healthcare information system interfaces, with almost 17,000 distinct interfaces to almost 300 vendor systems in almost 3,500 facilities domestically. In addition to our range of infusion and dispensing systems and respiratory products, we also offer a comprehensive group of value added services and programs, software technical services and clinical education. Our project management teams help our customers develop a project implementation plan and help to ensure a rapid, seamless implementation of our products. We offer a field service organization as well as customer call centers to support our customers before, during and after product installation. Our field service organization provides on site expertise to resolve customers service issues, and we operate several customer call centers to provide additional support to our customers. We also maintain a remote access system to help us quickly diagnose and rapidly resolve customers service issues. The following chart presents the CCT segments key business units and product lines: Business Unit Product Lines Infusion IV medication safety and infusion therapy delivery systems, including dedicated and non dedicated disposables, software applications and related patient monitoring equipment (sold under the Alaris, SmartSite, MaxPlus and MaxGuard brands) Dispensing Automated dispensing machines and related applications for distributing and managing medication and medical supplies (sold under the Pyxis brand) Respiratory Care Equipment and supplies for ventilation and respiratory and sleep diagnostics (sold under the AVEA, Pulmonetic Systems, Jaeger and SensorMedics brands) Infusion We are a leader in the design, development and marketing of IV medication technology, including IV infusion systems that deliver medications and other fluids directly into a patients veins in precise, measured quantities over a wide range of infusion rates. We have the largest installed base of large volume infusion pumps (a key component of the infusion system) in the United States. We sell infusion products primarily to hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers and transport services. The international infusion systems market is more regionalized and fragmented than the United States market, and we have developed infusion products tailored to meet the different needs of this market. As regions become 4 Table of Contents more aware of the importance of patient safety, we expect the demand for more sophisticated products will increase as it has in the United States. We have an established presence in countries that have already recognized the importance of patient safety, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. Our Alaris System enables healthcare professionals to administer IV fluids while at the same time monitoring vital signs such as respiratory activity and blood oxygen levels. The Alaris System utilizes our proprietary Guardrails software application that alerts a clinician when a parameter is outside the institutions pre established limitations (known as a data set) for that medication, thereby helping to reduce IV medication errors. Using a centralized server, data sets can be uploaded wirelessly to the individual Alaris System units and continuous quality improvement (CQI) data can be downloaded from the Alaris System. The CQI data is then used to refine the data sets. In addition, the centralized server makes it possible to send infusion system data to other hospital information systems, including electronic medication administration records, pharmacy information systems, alarms, management applications and documentation systems. We offer a full range of disposable IV administration sets and accessories, many of which feature our proprietary SmartSite needle free valves. In addition, our acquisition of Medegen in May 2010 expanded our product offerings to include clinically differentiated IV needleless access valves and administration sets, which we expect to drive continued market penetration and innovation. In North America, each of our current large volume infusion pumps uses only dedicated disposable administration sets designed and manufactured by or for us for that particular pump. Dispensing We are the leading provider of point of care systems that automate the dispensing of medications and supplies in hospitals and other healthcare facilities in the United States, where about one out of every two acute care hospitals use our flagship product line, the Pyxis MedStation system. We sell our dispensing products primarily to hospitals and other healthcare facilities including oncology clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, long term care facilities and physician offices. Internationally, the standards for clinical and pharmacy practice, the prevalence of clinical information systems and the regulatory and reimbursement policies tend to vary by country and region. As such, the current market for our medication and supply dispensing products is in an early stage of development. We consider the international market for these products to be a long term growth opportunity. In August 2011, we took steps to accelerate our international growth by acquiring Rowa, whose robotic medication storage and retrieval systems are designed to address the unique pharmacy operations requirements outside of the United States. Studies show that the medication process is the most complex and therefore one of the largest sources of hospital inefficiencies. In 1989, we championed the concept of decentralized medication management where medications are securely maintained and accessed at the nurses unit and became the first to introduce automated dispensing products to the market. Our products are designed to help healthcare professionals reduce medication errors, enhance administrative controls, improve clinician workflow, increase operational efficiency and improve billing accuracy. Our products enable healthcare professionals to provide safer patient care by helping to ensure that the right medications are delivered in the right doses via the right routes to the right patients at the right times. Our Pyxis medication management products automate the management of medications from the pharmacy to the nursing unit and integrate with other operational and information systems within the hospital. Other Pyxis products that are focused on medication management include the Pyxis Anesthesia system for medication dispensing in the operating room and the PyxisConnect physician order management system, which streamlines the physician order process, decreases order turnaround time and reduces transcription errors. We have other product offerings that, among other things, help to secure, track and replenish supplies of controlled substances and help to ensure the accuracy of medications picked in the pharmacy and delivered to the Pyxis MedStation system. 5 Table of Contents In addition to medication dispensing, we also offer a comprehensive portfolio of medical supply management systems at the point of use, including the Pyxis SupplyStation system and the Pyxis ProcedureStation system, which are supply dispensing systems with controlled access and radio frequency features that deliver custom solutions tailored to meet the needs of each customer. Following our acquisition of Vestara in April 2011, we also introduced the Pyxis Ecostation system, a hardware and software system that can help hospitals identify, classify and segregate pharmaceutical waste, while providing records to facilitate tracking and regulatory controls. We also offer wireless handheld technology that supports both our infusion and dispensing businesses. Our positive patient identification applications for bedside verification are a critical enabler of our integrated medication management and patient safety capabilities. Using our wireless handheld technologies for positive patient identification can help healthcare providers ensure the safety and accuracy of medication administration, specimen collection and blood transfusions. We believe these technologies can also improve patient charting and review. To help provide financial flexibility to our customers, we offer them the opportunity to lease our dispensing products. We provide the financing for the majority of our customers under our leasing program rather than relying on third party providers of credit. Respiratory Care We develop, manufacture, market and service products for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary and sleep related disorders. Patients with respiratory conditions are among the highest cost, highest risk, largest and fastest growing hospital populations. We offer an extensive line of industry leading mechanical ventilators marketed globally that treat respiratory insufficiency caused by illness, injury or premature birth. These products are used in a variety of settings, from intensive care units to homecare. We sell our respiratory care products worldwide to a variety of customers including hospitals, clinics, private physicians and research centers. We also offer high frequency oscillatory ventilators (HFOV) which are specialized devices designed to provide superior pulmonary gas exchange, while protecting the patients lungs from damage that may be caused by the cyclic expansion and contraction characteristic of conventional ventilators. Our HFOV products are primarily used to treat children and premature infants who suffer from acute respiratory failure and adults who suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome. We are one of the largest manufacturers of lung function testing equipment. We offer a broad line of pulmonary function testing equipment, from basic spirometry products, which measure the rate and volume of breathing, to complete pulmonary function and metabolic systems, which measure a wide range of heart, lung and metabolic functions. Other respiratory products we offer include dedicated disposables such as ventilator circuits (tubing used to connect patients to ventilator machines), oxygen masks, cannulae and suction catheters used to clear the trachea. We also have an established presence in the sleep diagnostics market and sell products ranging from basic sleep diagnostic systems that monitor a single patient to networked, modular, expandable sleep labs that can monitor multiple patients simultaneously. Our range of products used to treat obstructive sleep apnea includes face masks, headgear, replacement filters and tubing, and a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device for providing the therapy. Medical Technologies and Services Segment In our Medical Technologies and Services (MT&S) segment, we develop, manufacture and market single use skin antiseptic and other patient preparation products, software based infection detection services, reusable surgical instruments and neurological monitoring and diagnostic equipment. The majority of products in this segment are 6 Table of Contents used in the operating room and interventional suites, and to a lesser degree in the critical care departments of hospitals. We sell these products and services through a combination of direct sales representatives and third party distributors. The following chart presents the MT&S segments key business units and product lines: Business Unit Product Lines Infection Prevention Single use skin antiseptic (sold under the ChloraPrep brand) and other patient preparation, hair removal and skin care products Medical Specialties Surgical instruments (sold under the V. Mueller brand), interventional specialty products, such as diagnostic trays and biopsy needles, drainage catheters and vertebral augmentation products In addition, our MT&S segment includes our MedMined business, which develops infection detection software, and our Neurological Care business, which provides neurodiagnostic and monitoring solutions. In furtherance of our business strategy to divest non core businesses and product lines that do not align with our objectives, we sold several businesses that were historically part of the MT&S segment. During fiscal year 2010, we sold our Audiology business and our Research Services business. During fiscal year 2011, we also divested our OnSite Services instrument management and repair business and our International Surgical Products business, which sold third party sourced surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products and custom surgical procedure kits outside of the United States. Infection Prevention Our infection prevention business consists mainly of single use medical products used in surgical and vascular access procedures. Many of these products enhance patient outcomes by helping reduce HAIs. HAIs are a significant issue for hospitals around the world, and a recent cost estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the CDC) puts the economic impact of HAIs between $35 billion and $45 billion per year in the United States alone. As of October 1, 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services no longer reimburse hospitals for the added cost of treating certain HAIs, placing an increased economic burden on hospitals. Most HAIs are related to routine procedures and occurrences in hospitals; in fact, the CDC estimates that 32% of all HAIs are urinary tract infections, 22% are surgical site infections, and 14% are bloodstream infections. Our key product offering is our line of proprietary ChloraPrep sterile single use applicators, which are used by hospitals and surgery centers as a skin antiseptic before surgical procedures or before injections. We began to market the ChloraPrep products in the United States upon our acquisition of the assets of Enturia in fiscal year 2008, and have since expanded into international markets. ChloraPrep products use a 2.0% concentration of the skin antiseptic chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the superiority of CHG to traditional iodine based products. As a result, more than a dozen internationally recognized agencies and organizations, including the CDC, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, the National Institutes of Health, the American Association of Critical Care Nurses and the American Academy of Pediatrics support the use of CHG based formulations for patient skin preparation. In addition to ChloraPrep products, we also manufacture and market a broad line of patient preparation, hair removal and skin care products, including clippers and razors, special soaps, sponges and scrub brushes for surgeons and other operating room personnel. While our direct selling organization primarily promotes our infection prevention products to acute care hospitals, our products are also used in ambulatory surgical centers and other healthcare settings such as home health and reference labs. 7 Table of Contents We have sales representatives or commissioned agents outside the United States. We currently have regulatory approval to sell ChloraPrep products in the United Kingdom, and over a dozen countries in Europe, and over time our intention is to use our sales organization outside the United States to bring ChloraPrep products to additional international markets. We also offer MedMined services that feature infection detection software for hospitals, alerting clinicians to early signs of an emerging infection issue and allowing the hospital to target improvement efforts at the right place and time. This patented program automatically identifies patterns indicative of specific and correctable quality breakdowns to prevent and treat HAIs. More than 300 hospitals in the United States use MedMined services to help them detect, monitor, prevent and measure outcomes related to HAIs. Medical Specialties Our V. Mueller brand is the largest United States supplier of reusable stainless steel surgical instruments primarily focused on the operating room. V. Mueller is an established brand that has been in business for over 100 years and today enables hospitals and surgeons to manage their surgical instruments to ensure the highest level of safety, productivity, quality and performance. We offer over 25,000 unique surgical instruments, as well as surgical instrument information tracking systems and surgical instrument sterilization container systems. Key products include clamps, needle holders, retractors, specialty scissors and forceps. Our V. Mueller products are sold predominantly in the United States directly to hospitals through a direct selling organization. Additionally, we develop and manufacture a variety of medical devices used primarily by interventional radiologists and surgeons in combination with certain image guidance technologies (for example, x ray, computed tomography and ultrasound). We offer an extensive line of products that support interventional medicine for a variety of clinical disciplines in body and spine pain interventions. Our products include diagnostic trays, bone marrow and soft tissue biopsy needles, drainage catheters and vertebral augmentation products to treat painful fractures of the spine. These products are sold predominantly in the United States directly to hospitals. In addition to the products and services described above, we also develop, manufacture, market and service a comprehensive line of neurological and vascular diagnostic and monitoring products, as well as provide a complete line of accessories for these devices. We sell these products globally to a variety of customers, including hospitals and other healthcare facilities such as private practice and outpatient clinics, ambulatory surgery centers and physician offices. Competition The markets for our products are highly competitive. No one company competes with us across the breadth of our offerings, but individual product lines face significant competition in both our domestic and international markets. We compete based upon quality and reliability, technological innovation, price, customer service and support capabilities, brand recognition, patents and other intellectual property and the value proposition of helping improve patient outcomes, while reducing overall costs associated with patient safety. We believe our superior product quality and brand strength give us a competitive advantage. We expect to continue to use our clinical expertise to offer innovative, industry leading products for our customers. Customers, Sales and Distribution Sales to customers in the United States accounted for approximately 80% of our fiscal year 2011 revenue. Our primary end customers in the United States include hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, clinics, long term care facilities and physician offices. A substantial portion of our products in the United States are sold to hospitals that are members of a group purchasing organization (GPO), integrated delivery networks (IDNs), and through wholesalers and distributors. Included within our product sales to wholesalers and distributors are product sales to Cardinal Health, with whom we have a non exclusive distribution relationship following the spinoff. We have purchasing agreements for specified products with a wide range of GPOs in the United States. 8 Table of Contents The scope of products included in these agreements varies by GPO. Sales to customers outside the United States comprised approximately 20% of our fiscal year 2011 revenue, including sales to customers in over 130 countries worldwide. Our primary customers in markets outside the United States are hospitals and wholesalers, which are served through a direct sales force with a presence in more than 15 countries and a network of distributors. Our capital equipment products generally are delivered from our manufacturing facilities directly to the customer. Our disposables and other non capital equipment products generally are delivered from our manufacturing facilities and from third party manufacturers to warehouses and from there, the products are delivered to the customer. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products by road, rail, sea and air. Intellectual Property Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others. We hold numerous patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the United States and in other countries that relate to aspects of the technology used in many of our products. Our policy is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries when we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. We own or have rights to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business. Some of the more important trademarks that we own or have rights to use that appear in this Annual Report on Form 10 K include: CareFusionTM, Alaris&reg;, Guardrails&reg;, Pyxis&reg;, AVEA&reg;, Pulmonetic SystemsTM, Jaeger&reg;, SensorMedics&reg;, ChloraPrep&reg;, V. Mueller&reg;, SmartSite&reg;, PyxisConnect&reg;, Pyxis MedStationTM, Pyxis SupplyStationTM, Pyxis ProcedureStationTM, Pyxis EcoStationTM, MedMinedTM, CardinalASSISTTM, EnVeTM, Valuelink&reg;, MaxPlusTM and MaxGuardTM which may be registered or trademarked in the United States and other jurisdictions. Research and Development We continuously engage in research and development to introduce new products and enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of our existing products. Our research and development efforts include internal initiatives as well as collaborative development opportunities with third parties and licensing or acquiring technology from third parties. We employ engineers, software developers, clinicians and scientists in research and development worldwide. These experts enable us to create innovative, industry leading products and services because of their in depth understanding of the medical and clinical protocols for our product lines. Our research and development expenses were $155 million, $159 million and $160 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We evaluate developing technologies in areas where we have technological or marketing expertise for possible investment or acquisition. We intend to continue our focus on research and development as a key strategy for growth, which will focus on internal and external investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. 9 Table of Contents Quality Management We place significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to our customers. Quality management plays an essential role in understanding and meeting customer requirements, effectively resolving quality issues and improving our products and services. We have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of our products. To assess and facilitate compliance with applicable requirements, we regularly review our quality systems to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. We also perform assessments of our suppliers of raw materials, components and finished goods. In addition, we conduct quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of products and services. From time to time, we may determine that products manufactured or marketed by us do not meet our specifications, published standards or regulatory requirements. When a quality issue is identified, we investigate the issue and seek to take appropriate corrective action, such as withdrawal of the product from the market, correction of the product at the customer location, notice to the customer of revised labeling or other actions. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business. Regulatory Matters Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our medical device products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation. Most notably, all of our medical devices sold in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), as implemented and enforced by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA, and in some cases other government agencies, administers requirements covering the design, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution and post market surveillance of our products. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market must first receive either premarket notification clearance (by making a 510(k) submission) or premarket approval (by filing a premarket approval application (PMA)) from the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act. In addition, certain modifications made to marketed devices also may require 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. The FDAs 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months, but it can last longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer. The FDA has recently announced recommendations following two task force investigations into the agencys medical device 510(k) clearance process. If implemented, these recommendations would make the 510(k) clearance process more expensive for us, and could result in delays of future launches of new or modified medical devices. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will be obtained for any product that we propose to market. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements include the following: product listing and establishment registration; adherence to the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which requires stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; labeling requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of off label uses or indications; adverse event reporting; post approval restrictions or conditions, including post approval clinical trials or other required testing; post market surveillance requirements; the FDAs recall authority, whereby it can ask for, or require, the recall of products from the market; and requirements relating to voluntary corrections or removals. Our manufacturing facilities, as well as those of certain of our suppliers, are subject to periodic and for cause inspections to verify compliance with the QSR as well as other regulatory requirements. If the FDA were to find 10 Table of Contents that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacturing and distributing products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made outside of the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business. Regulation of Medical Devices Outside of the United States Medical device laws also are in effect in many of the non United States markets in which we do business. These laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications. Inspection of and controls over manufacturing, as well as monitoring of device related adverse events, also are components of most of these regulatory systems. Most of our business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. For example, the European Commission (EC) has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through European Medical Device Directives with which manufacturers must comply. Under these regulations, manufacturers must have received product EC certification from a notified body in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the European Union. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products with an EC mark. Products covered by the EC regulations that do not bear the EC mark may not be sold or distributed within the European Union. Regulation of Drugs We market a line of topical antiseptics under the ChloraPrep brand name that are regulated by the FDA and comparable international authorities as nonprescription or over the counter (OTC) drugs. Some of these products are marketed under a new drug application approved by the FDA or its international counterparts. OTC drugs are regulated in the same fashion as prescription drugs in that we must comply with good manufacturing practices, our manufacturing facilities (or those of our contract manufacturers) must be registered and all facilities are subject to inspection by federal and state authorities. Outside the United States, regulatory authorities regulate our OTC products in a manner similar to the FDA. In the United States, advertising of OTC drugs is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, which imposes certain restrictions on our promotional activities for these products. If we (or our suppliers) fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we could face sanctions ranging from warning letters, injunctions, product seizures, civil or criminal enforcement actions, consent decrees, or removal of the product from distribution. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business. Healthcare Laws We are subject to various federal, state and local laws in the United States targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, which generally prohibit us from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other government sponsored healthcare programs. Healthcare costs have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. The United States federal government continues to scrutinize potentially fraudulent practices affecting Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Payers have become more influential in the marketplace and increasingly are focused on drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of healthcare. Violations of fraud and abuse related laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. 11 Table of Contents Other Regulatory Requirements We are also subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti bribery laws applicable in non United States jurisdictions that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non United States government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government sponsored healthcare systems around the world, most of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In the sale, delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the United States, we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those administered by the Department of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and or with certain individuals identified by the United States government. Despite our global trade and compliance program, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and imprisonment. Raw Materials We use a wide variety of resin, metals and electrical components for production of our products. We primarily purchase these materials from external suppliers, some of which are single source suppliers. We purchase materials from selected suppliers based on quality assurance, cost effectiveness and constraints resulting from regulatory requirements, and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Global commodity pricing can ultimately affect pricing of certain of these raw materials. Though we believe we have adequate available sources of raw materials, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access the quantity of raw material needed to sustain operations as well as at a cost effective price. Environmental Our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws. In the United States, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies administer laws that restrict the emission of pollutants into the air, discharges of pollutants into bodies of water and disposal of pollutants on the ground. Violations of these laws can result in significant civil and criminal penalties and incarceration. The failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental law and subject the owner and operator to civil and criminal sanctions. Most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental law. United States laws also typically allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations. Outside the United States, the environmental laws and their enforcement vary and may be more burdensome. For example, some European countries impose environmental taxes or require manufacturers to take back used products at the end of their useful life, and others restrict the materials that manufacturers may use in their products and require redesign and labeling of products. Although such laws do not currently have a significant impact on our products, they are expanding rapidly in Europe. We have management programs and processes in place that are intended to minimize the potential for violations of these laws. Other environmental laws, primarily in the United States, address the contamination of land and groundwater and require the clean up of such contamination. These laws may apply not only to the owner or operator of an on going business, but also to the owner of land contaminated by a prior owner or operator. In addition, if a parcel is contaminated by the release of a hazardous substance, such as through its historic use as a disposal site, any person or company that has contributed to that contamination, whether or not it has a legal interest in the land, may be subject to a requirement to clean up the parcel. 12 Table of Contents Employees At June 30, 2011, we employed over 14,000 people across our global operations, with approximately 6,500 employed in the United States. In Europe, some of our employees are represented by unions or works councils. Overall, we consider our employee relations to be good.

We have included the certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Section 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules, relating to the quality of our public disclosure, as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10 K. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We urge you to carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10 K in evaluating us and our common stock. Any of the following risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to our business and risks related to our common stock. Risks Related to Our Business We may be unable to effectively enhance our existing products or introduce and market new products or may fail to keep pace with advances in technology. The healthcare industry is characterized by evolving technologies and industry standards, frequent new product introductions, significant competition and dynamic customer requirements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive. As a result, our position in the industry could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products, as well as the pricing models for such products. The success of our business depends on our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products and adapt to these changing technologies and customer requirements. The success of new product development depends on many factors, including our ability to anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory approvals and clearances on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in a cost effective and timely manner, maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. To compete successfully in the marketplace, we must make substantial investments in new product development whether internally or externally through licensing, acquisitions or joint development agreements. Our failure to enhance our existing products or introduce new and innovative products in a timely manner would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 13 Table of Contents Even if we are able to develop, manufacture and obtain regulatory approvals and clearances for our new products, the success of those products would depend upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for our new products could be affected by several factors, including: the availability of alternative products from our competitors; the price and reliability of our products relative to that of our competitors; the timing of our market entry; and our ability to market and distribute our products effectively. We are subject to complex and costly regulation. Our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other national, supranational, federal and state governmental authorities. It can be costly and time consuming to obtain regulatory clearance and or approval to market a medical device or other product. Clearance and or approval might not be granted for a new or modified device or other product on a timely basis, if at all. Regulations are subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales. Unless an exception applies, the FDA requires that the manufacturer of a new medical device or a new indication for use of, or other significant change in, an existing medical device obtain either 510(k) pre market notification clearance or pre market approval before those products can be marketed or sold in the United States. Modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, labeling, packaging, or manufacturing process may also require a new 510(k) clearance. Most recently, the FDA has proposed changes to its 510(k) pre market clearance process and although we cannot predict with certainty the future impact of these initiatives, it appears that the time and cost to get many of our medical devices to market could increase significantly. In addition, we are subject to regulations covering manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising, and adverse event reporting that apply after we have obtained clearance or approval to sell a product. Our failure to maintain clearances or approvals for existing products, to obtain clearance or approval for new or modified products, or to adhere to regulations for manufacturing, labeling, advertising or adverse event reporting could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Further, if we determine a product manufactured or marketed by us does not meet our specifications, published standards or regulatory requirements, we may seek to correct the product or withdraw the product from the market, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to ongoing oversight, including periodic inspection by governmental authorities. Compliance with production, safety, quality control and quality assurance regulations can be costly and time consuming. The sales and marketing of medical devices is under increased scrutiny by the FDA and other enforcement bodies. If our sales and marketing activities fail to comply with FDA regulations or guidelines, or other applicable laws, we may be subject to warnings or enforcement actions from the FDA or other enforcement bodies. A number of companies in the healthcare industry have been the subject of enforcement actions related to their sales and marketing practices, including their relationships with doctors and off label promotion of products. In April 2011, we received a federal administrative subpoena from the Department of Justice. Based on the request, we believe the Department of Justice is investigating various aspects of our sales and marketing practices related to our ChloraPrep skin preparation product. See note 14 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in this Form 10 K for more information. We cannot control the pace or scope of any investigation, and responding to the subpoena request and any investigation will require the allocation of resources, including management time and attention. If we were to become the subject of an enforcement action, including any action resulting from the Department of Justice investigation, it could result in negative publicity, penalties, fines, the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federally funded programs and or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 14 Table of Contents Cost containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups, third party payers and governmental organizations could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Many existing and potential customers for our products within the United States are members of GPOs and IDNs in an effort to reduce costs. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. Due to the highly competitive nature of the GPO and IDN contracting processes, we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs across our product portfolio. Furthermore, the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products, thereby reducing our profitability. While having a contract with a GPO or IDN can facilitate sales to members of that GPO or IDN, it is no assurance that sales volume of those products will be maintained. The members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors, which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability. In addition, our capital equipment products typically represent a sizeable initial capital expenditure for healthcare organizations. Changes in the budgets of these organizations, the timing of spending under these budgets and conflicting spending priorities, including changes resulting from adverse economic conditions, can have a significant effect on the demand for our capital equipment products and related services. In addition, the implementation of healthcare reform in the United States, which may reduce or eliminate the amount that healthcare organizations may be reimbursed for our capital equipment products and related services, could further impact demand. Any such decreases in expenditures by these healthcare facilities and decreases in demand for our capital equipment products and related services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Distributors of our products may begin to negotiate terms of sale more aggressively in an effort to increase their profitability. Failure to negotiate distribution arrangements having advantageous pricing or other terms of sale could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we fail to implement distribution arrangements successfully, it could cause us to lose market share to our competitors. Outside the United States, we have experienced downward pricing pressure due to the concentration of purchasing power in centralized governmental healthcare authorities and increased efforts by such authorities to lower healthcare costs. Our failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could adversely affect our sales and profitability in these markets. Current economic conditions have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the financial markets and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the United States and other parts of the world have had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause our customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and have caused and may continue to cause vendors to reduce their output or change terms of sales. We have observed certain hospitals delaying as well as prioritizing capital purchasing decisions, which has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our financial results into the foreseeable future. If our customers cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate or fail to improve, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to us. Likewise, for similar reasons, vendors may restrict credit or impose different payment terms. We also extend credit through an equipment leasing program for a substantial portion of sales to our dispensing product customers. This program and any similar programs that we may establish for sales of our other capital equipment, exposes us to certain risks. We are subject to the risk that if these customers fail to pay or delay payment for the products they purchase from us, it could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, defaults exceeding our expectations and an adverse impact on the cost or availability of financing. These 15 Table of Contents risks related to our equipment leasing program may be exacerbated by a variety of factors, including adverse economic conditions, decreases in demand for our capital equipment products and negative trends in the businesses of our leasing customers. Any inability of current and or potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may be unable to realize any benefit from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected. In August 2010, we announced plans for various cost reduction and restructuring activities. These plans generated operating expense savings of approximately $103 million in fiscal year 2011, and we expect incremental savings of approximately $25 million in fiscal year 2012, through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions and other savings. We may engage in other restructuring activities in the future, including related to the realignment of our businesses into two new global operating segments and other related company initiatives. These types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may take in the future, any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. In addition, the costs associated with implementing our restructuring plan might exceed expectations, which could result in additional future charges. We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will remain valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. In addition, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the United States, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property, or if we are unable to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitiveness could be impaired, which would limit our growth and future revenue. We operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation is costly to defend and can result in significant damage awards, including treble damages under certain circumstances, and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products. At any given time, we are involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. We can expect to face additional claims of patent infringement in the future. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Defects or failures associated with our products and or our quality system could lead to the filing of adverse event reports, product recalls or safety alerts and negative publicity and could subject us to regulatory actions. Manufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, off label uses or inadequate disclosure of product related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. These problems could lead to a recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products and result in significant costs and negative 16 Table of Contents publicity. Due to the strong name recognition of our brands, an adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. In some circumstances, adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals or clearances. We may also voluntarily undertake a recall of our products, temporarily shut down production lines, or place products on a shipping hold based on internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data. Our future operating results will depend on our ability to sustain an effective quality control system and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to our quality system. Our quality system plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects and improving our products and services. While we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in public warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacturing and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made outside the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. Any of the foregoing events could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are currently operating under an amended consent decree with the FDA and our failure to comply with the requirements of the amended consent decree may have an adverse effect on our business. We are operating under an amended consent decree with the FDA related to our infusion pump business in the United States. We entered into a consent decree with the FDA in February 2007 related to our Alaris SE pumps, and in February 2009, we and the FDA amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for our subsidiary that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the United States. In accordance with the amended consent decree, and in addition to the requirements of the original consent decree, we implemented a corrective action plan to bring the Alaris System and all other infusion pumps in use in the United States market into compliance, had our infusion pump facilities inspected by an independent expert and had our recall procedures and all ongoing recalls involving our infusion pumps inspected by an independent recall expert. In July 2010, the FDA notified us that we can proceed to the audit inspection phase of the amended consent decree, which includes the requirement to retain an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of our infusion pump facilities. The costs associated with these ongoing audits, and any actions that we may need to take resulting from these audits, could be significant. We have no reserve in connection with the amended consent decree to cover any future costs and expenses of compliance with the amended consent decree. As such, we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because, among other things, the FDA may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree, and or we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree. Moreover, the matters addressed in the amended consent decree could lead to negative publicity that could have an adverse impact on our business. The amended consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing, recall products and take other actions. We may also be required to pay monetary damages if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree. See note 14 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in this Form 10 K for more information. Any of the foregoing matters could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur product liability losses and other litigation liability. We are, and may be in the future, subject to product liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions, alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury. Any product 17 Table of Contents liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could be costly to defend and could result in settlement payments and adjustments not covered by or in excess of insurance. In addition, we may not be able to obtain insurance on terms acceptable to us or at all because insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain. Our failure to successfully defend against product liability claims or maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. Legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business, or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages that exceed our insurance coverage, if any. In addition, we cannot predict the results of future legislative activity or future court decisions, any of which could lead to an increase in regulatory investigations or our exposure to litigation. Any such proceedings or investigations, regardless of the merits, may result in substantial costs, the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns and additional restrictions on our sales or the use of our products, which could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We rely on the performance of our information technology systems, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business and performance. Our business requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. These systems are vulnerable to interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction and other events, which are beyond our control. Systems interruptions could reduce our ability to manufacture and provide service for our products, and could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. The level of protection and disaster recovery capability varies from site to site, and there can be no guarantee that any such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be totally effective. In addition, we are pursuing initiatives to transform our information technology systems and processes. Many of our business units use disparate systems and processes, including those required to support critical functions related to our operations, sales, and financial close and reporting. We are implementing new systems to better streamline and integrate critical functions, which we expect to result in improved efficiency and, over time, reduced costs. While we believe these initiatives provide significant opportunity for us, they do expose us to inherent risks. We may suffer data loss or delays or other disruptions to our business, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to successfully implement new information technology systems and processes, we may fail to realize cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives. An interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, an inability to obtain key components or raw materials or an increase in the cost of key components or raw materials may adversely affect our business. Many of our key products are manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of our facilities, it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. In addition, for reasons of quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase certain components and raw materials from sole suppliers. We may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components that are acceptable to us, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment efforts of our customers and third party payers, we may be unable to pass along cost increases for key components or raw materials through higher prices to our customers. If the cost of key components or raw materials increases and we are unable fully to recover these increased costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability. 18 Table of Contents We may engage in strategic transactions, including acquisitions, investments, or joint development agreements that may have an adverse effect on our business. We may pursue transactions, including acquisitions of complementary businesses, technology licensing arrangements and joint development agreements to expand our product offerings and geographic presence as part of our business strategy, which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We may not complete transactions in a timely manner, on a cost effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition, license arrangement or joint development agreement. Other companies may compete with us for these strategic opportunities. We also could experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges, and other issues that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of an acquired company or business, including issues related to internal control over financial reporting, regulatory or compliance issues and potential adverse short term effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could cause a deterioration of our credit profile and or ratings and result in reduced availability of credit to us or in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. We could experience difficulties, expenditures, or other risks in integrating an acquired company, business, or technology, including, among others: diversion of management resources and focus from ongoing business matters; retention of key employees following an acquisition; demands on our operational resources and financial and internal control systems; integration of an acquired companys corporate and administrative functions and personnel; liabilities of the acquired company, including litigation or other claims; and consolidation of research and development operations. In addition, we may face additional risks related to foreign acquisitions, including risks related to cultural and language differences and particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may engage in the divestiture of some of our non core businesses or product lines which may have an adverse effect on our business. Our business strategy involves assessing our portfolio of businesses with a view of divesting non core businesses and product lines that do not align with our objectives. Any divestitures may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings, as well as significant write offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Divestitures could involve additional risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. We may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line. See note 2 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in this Form 10 K for a discussion of our divestitures. We may face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform. Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was signed into law in the United States through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act. Among other initiatives, the legislation provides for a 2.3% annual excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the United States, commencing in January 2013. This enacted excise tax may adversely affect our operating expenses and results of operations. In addition, we anticipate that the current presidential administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and 19 Table of Contents payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. Public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future. We cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the state level, or what ultimate effect federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and services. However, the implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for our products, reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business, possibly materially. We may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing stockholders. We intend to increase our investment in research and development activities, expand our sales and marketing activities, and may make acquisitions. Our ability to take these and other actions may be limited by our available liquidity, including our ability to access our foreign cash balances in a tax efficient manner. As a consequence, in the future, we may need to seek additional financing. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we lose an investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants. Additionally, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Recent disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions and reduced lending activity, may adversely affect the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future. We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non United States laws, regulations and customs. Sales to customers outside of the United States made up approximately 20% of our revenue in fiscal year 2011, and we expect that non United States sales will contribute to future growth. The risks associated with our operations outside the United States include: healthcare reform legislation; changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs; changes in non United States government programs; multiple non United States regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products; possible failure to comply with anti bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions; different local medical practices, product preferences and product requirements; possible failure to comply with trade protection and restriction measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non United States operations; different labor regulations or work stoppages or strikes; changes in environmental, health and safety laws; potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws, including changes regarding taxation of income earned outside the United States; political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts; economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; 20 Table of Contents uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures; minimal or diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and regulatory changes that may place our products at a disadvantage. These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, we are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations. We are also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the United States dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries such as the Euro, where we sell our products, our United States dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Additionally, we incur significant costs in foreign currencies and a fluctuation in those currencies value can negatively impact manufacturing and selling costs. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future. We are subject to various United States federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws and regulations are wide ranging and subject to changing interpretation and application, which could restrict our sales or marketing practices. Furthermore, since many of our customers rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures, our exclusion from such programs as a result of a violation of these laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations. We have outstanding $1.4 billion of senior unsecured notes that were utilized to finance our separation from Cardinal Health. This significant amount of debt has important risks to us and our investors, including: requiring a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt; making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations; increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt as we are; and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock. In addition, on July 6, 2011, we entered into a $550 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (maturing July 6, 2016). To the extent that we draw on our credit facility or otherwise incur additional indebtedness, the 21 Table of Contents risks described above could increase. Further, if we increase our indebtedness, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt. As a result of various restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our senior unsecured notes, our financial flexibility will be restricted in a number of ways. The agreement governing the senior unsecured revolving credit facility subjects us to several financial and other restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness and transactions with affiliates. Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial ratio tests on an ongoing basis that may require us to take action and reduce debt or act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests. We cannot be sure that we will be able to meet those tests or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior revolving credit facility. If an event of default under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility or senior unsecured notes occurs, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. We cannot be sure that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as international, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. Our reserves against disputed tax obligations may ultimately prove to be insufficient. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing audits of Cardinal Healths fiscal years 2001 through 2007. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, Cardinal Health received an IRS Revenue Agents Report for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2003 through 2005 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between our foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries, which we have appealed. The amount of additional tax proposed by the IRS in these notices totals $462 million, excluding penalties and interest, which may be significant. In addition, during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 we received an IRS Revenue Agents Report for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 that included Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries. We and Cardinal Health disagree with the IRS regarding its application of the United States Treasury regulations to the arrangements under review and the valuations underlying such adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them. During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, we began substantive discussions with the IRS Appeals office related to our 2003 through 2005 fiscal years and those discussions are ongoing. During the quarter ending September 30, 2011, we will commence the tax audit for the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 and the short period July 1 through August 31, 2009, as part of Cardinal Healths tax audit of its federal consolidated returns for fiscal years 2008 through 2010. We regularly review our tax reserves and make adjustments to our reserves when appropriate. Accounting for tax reserves involves complex and subjective estimates by management, which can change over time based on new information or changing events or circumstances, including events or circumstances outside of our control. Although we believe that we have provided appropriate tax reserves for any potential tax exposures, we may not be 22 Table of Contents fully reserved and it is possible that we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, including the full amount that the IRS is seeking in the appeals matters for our 2003 through 2007 fiscal tax years. The tax matters agreement that we entered into with Cardinal Health in connection with the separation generally provides that the control of audit proceedings and payment of any additional liability related to our business is our responsibility. Any future change in estimate or obligation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See note 13 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements included in this Form 10 K filed for a discussion of the Notices of Proposed Adjustment for our fiscal years ended 2003 through 2007 and the change to our tax reserves. If there is a determination that the separation is taxable for United States federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the IRS ruling or tax opinions are incorrect or for any other reason, then Cardinal Health and its shareholders that are subject to United States federal income tax could incur significant United States federal income tax liabilities and we could incur significant liabilities. In connection with the separation, Cardinal Health received a private letter ruling from the IRS substantially to the effect that, among other things, the contribution and the distribution qualified as a transaction that is tax free for United States federal income tax purposes under Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the Code). In addition, Cardinal Health received opinions of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, co counsel to Cardinal Health, to the effect that the contribution and the distribution qualified as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The ruling and opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Cardinal Health and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Cardinal Health and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct, have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of Cardinal Health or us after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for United States federal income tax purposes, Cardinal Health and its shareholders that are subject to United States federal income tax could incur significant United States federal income tax liabilities and we could incur significant liabilities. Our success depends on our key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or the transition of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, could disrupt our business. Our success depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key research and development, sales, marketing and operations personnel. In addition, the transition of key personnel exposes us to additional risks. Effective as of December 1, 2010, we announced James Hinrichs as our Chief Financial Officer, and effective as of January 29, 2011, we announced Kieran Gallahue as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, on June 30, 2011, Dwight Winstead, our Chief Operating Officer left the company. While we will strive to make these transitions as smooth as possible, the transition process related to these individuals, as well as for any other key personnel, may result in disruptions to our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate our senior management and other key personnel. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including the intense competition for such highly skilled personnel, fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, changes in our senior management, competitors hiring practices, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate such personnel in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis, we may experience difficulty in implementing our business strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 23 Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Common Stock Your percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future. As with any publicly traded company, your percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results; changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; and domestic and foreign economic conditions. Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by laws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting; rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; the right of our board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; the division of our board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three year term; a provision that stockholders may only remove directors with cause; the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and the requirement that stockholders holding at least 80% of our voting stock are required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by laws relating to the number, term and election of our directors, the filling of board vacancies, stockholder notice procedures and the calling of special meetings of stockholders. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our principal executive offices are located in a facility that we own in San Diego, California. At June 30, 2011, we owned or leased a total of approximately 3.5 million square feet of facility space worldwide to handle manufacturing, production, assembly, research, quality assurance testing, distribution, packaging, and administrative functions. At June 30, 2011, we had 18 manufacturing facilities of which 10 were located in the United States. We consider our operating facilities to be well maintained and suitable for the operations conducted in them. We periodically evaluate our operating properties and we may make additions, improvements and consolidations, when appropriate. None of our facilities experienced any significant idle time during fiscal year 2011.

Moreover, should we pay any dividends in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends. 26 Table of Contents Performance Graph This performance graph is furnished and shall not be deemed filed with the SEC or subject to Section 18 of the Exchange Act, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) presented below refer to and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to CareFusion Corporation, CareFusion, we, us, our and our company refer to CareFusion Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. References in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to Cardinal Health refers to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview We are a global medical technology company with clinically proven and industry leading products and services designed to measurably improve the safety, quality, efficiency and cost of healthcare. We offer comprehensive product lines in the areas of IV infusion, medication and supply dispensing, respiratory care, infection prevention and surgical instruments to customers in the United States and over 130 countries throughout the world. Our strategy is to enhance growth by focusing on healthcare safety and productivity, driving innovation and clinical differentiation, accelerating our global growth and pursing strategic opportunities. Our primary customers in the United States include hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, clinics, long term care facilities and physician offices. For each of fiscal years 2011 and 2010, we generated revenue of $3.5 billion. We generated income from continuing operations of $291 million in fiscal year 2011 and $158 million in fiscal year 2010. Approximately 20% of our fiscal year 2011 revenue was from customers outside of the United States. Separation from Cardinal Health, Inc. We were incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 2009 for the purpose of holding Cardinal Health, Inc.s clinical and medical products businesses in anticipation of spinning off from Cardinal Health. We completed the spinoff from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health contributed the majority of the businesses comprising its clinical and medical products segment to us and distributed approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 179.8 million shares, to its shareholders. Cardinal Health retained approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 41.4 million shares, in connection with the spinoff. As of September 15, 2010, Cardinal Health had sold all remaining shares of our common stock retained in connection with the spinoff. We have incurred one time expenditures in connection with the separation from Cardinal Health (capital and expense), primarily associated with employee related costs, costs to start up certain stand alone functions and information technology systems and other one time transaction related costs. In fiscal years 2011 and 2010, we incurred approximately $80 million and $120 million, respectively, of these one time expenditures. While we expect to continue to incur some additional expenditures related to the separation in fiscal 2012, we believe that all substantive expenditures associated with standing up operations from the spinoff are complete. We have funded, and expect to continue funding these costs through cash from operations and cash on hand. The capital portion of these expenditures will be amortized over their useful lives and the other expenditures will be expensed as incurred, depending on their nature. Additionally, we have incurred increased costs as an independent, publicly traded company, primarily as a result of higher charges than in the past from Cardinal Health for transition services and from establishing or expanding the corporate support for our businesses, including information technology, human resources, treasury, tax, risk management, accounting and financial reporting, investor relations, legal, procurement and other services. We believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these additional corporate expenses going forward. 30 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations The Overall Global Economic Environment, Industry Growth and Trends Healthcare related industries are generally less susceptible than some other industries to fluctuations in the overall economic environment. However, some of our businesses rely on capital spending from our customers (primarily hospitals), which can be influenced by a variety of economic factors, including interest rates, access to financing and endowment fluctuations. Significant changes in these economic factors can affect the sales of our capital equipment products, such as infusion pumps, dispensing equipment and ventilators. Additionally, sales volumes for some of our businesses are dependent on hospital admissions. Changes in admissions due to difficult economic times can affect our results for surgical and single use products, such as infusion and respiratory disposable sets, surgical instruments and skin antiseptic products. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2009, challenges have existed in the capital equipment market from delays in hospital capital spending, as well as prioritization of capital spending. Despite seeing small signs of improvement, we continue to anticipate it will take some time before significant market improvements are realized. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to benefit from increases in hospital capital equipment spending as the market recovers over time. During fiscal year 2010, the healthcare industry was impacted by emergency preparedness efforts related to H1N1 and an anticipated severe flu season. This drove higher demand for our respiratory products in fiscal year 2010. While this demand benefited us in fiscal year 2010, our respiratory business continues to face a challenging capital spending market. In fiscal year 2011, as a result of a lighter than expected flu season and lower hospital admissions, we saw a negative impact on demand for our respiratory products. Healthcare Reform We are also affected by uncertainties in the healthcare industry related to healthcare reform. In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform was enacted in the United States through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Acts. In addition, we anticipate that the current presidential administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. The uncertainties regarding the implementation and impact of the enacted healthcare reform measures, as well as other potential reform initiatives in the future, may have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and services. Global Restructuring During fiscal year 2011 our operations were impacted by our global restructuring program. This program, announced in August 2010 (the 2011 Plan), was designed to reduce our cost structure and streamline operations, and was initially expected to result in a reduction of approximately 700 positions. The 2011 Plan resulted in a reduction of approximately 850 positions in fiscal 2011. This program provided operating expense savings of approximately $103 million in fiscal year 2011, primarily as a result of reducing headcount and eliminating unfilled positions. Of the $103 million of savings, approximately $65 million was a result of year over year savings in selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) and lower cost of sales expense, and $38 million was a result of not filling open positions. The 2011 plan is expected to result in incremental savings of approximately $25 million in fiscal year 2012. Initiation of this program resulted in approximately $46 million of restructuring charges during fiscal year 2011. Innovation and New Products Our business strategy relies significantly on innovation to develop and introduce new products and to differentiate our products from our competitors. Our investment expense in research and development during 31 Table of Contents fiscal year 2011 was $155 million, or 4% of revenues. Looking forward, we remain committed to producing a pipeline of innovative products to continue to support our growth strategies. We plan to increase our research and development expenditures with internal initiatives, as well as licensing or acquiring technology from third parties. Our internal and external investments will be focused on initiatives that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. With a significant investment in research and development, a strong focus on innovation and a well managed innovation process, we believe we can continue to innovate and grow. If, however, our future innovations are not successful in meeting customers needs or prove to be too costly versus their perceived benefit, our growth may slow. International and Foreign Exchange We sell our products in more than 130 countries and manufacture our products in nine countries in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Due to the global nature of our business, our revenue and expenses are influenced by foreign exchange movements. In fiscal year 2011, approximately 22% of our sales were in currencies other than the United States dollar. Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar compared to other currencies will affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into United States dollars. The percentage of fiscal year 2011 sales by major currencies was as follows: United States Dollar 78 % Euro 11 % British Pound 4 % All Other 7 % 100 % Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions have historically played a role in our growth, and we have made several significant acquisitions in the last five years. Our business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions by Cardinal Health of established healthcare companies, including the acquisition of VIASYS Healthcare Inc. (Viasys) in 2007, and the assets of Enturia, Inc. (Enturia) in 2008. Since our separation from Cardinal Health, we have taken steps to expand our product offerings through acquisitions. In May 2010, we acquired Medegen, a manufacturer of clinically differentiated IV needleless access valves and administration sets, and in April 2011, we acquired Vestara, a developer of technology solutions that enable the safe, efficient disposal and tracking of environmentally sensitive pharmaceutical waste. In August 2011, we completed our acquisition of Rowa, a Germany based company specializing in robotic medication storage and retrieval systems for retail and hospital pharmacies. While we believe that the integration of the businesses we have acquired have generally been successful, our failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully might negatively affect our results. Our strategy also involves assessing our portfolio of businesses with a view of divesting non core businesses that do not align with our objectives, such as the divestitures of our Audiology business in October 2009, and our Research Services business in May 2010. During fiscal year 2011, we also divested our International Surgical Products business and our Onsite Services business. The results of our Audiology business and our International Surgical Products business are reflected in discontinued operations in the financial information included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See note 2 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. Acquired In Process Research and Development During fiscal year 2010 we acquired and capitalized $45 million of in process research and development (IPR&D), related to our acquisition of Medegen. The value of this IPR&D was calculated based on a discounted cash flow method, which involved a number of significant assumptions, including timing of product 32 Table of Contents deployment, revenues, margin, and associated discount rates. Effective July 1, 2009, IPR&D associated with business combinations is recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and tested for impairment annually until it is put into service. Prior to July 1, 2009, all acquired IPR&D was expensed immediately. See note 10 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements. The IPR&D associated with Medegen is related to certain products that are under development and are expected to be launched in the next two to three years. Completion of these products is subject to certain regulatory approvals and logistics surrounding manufacturing the end products cost effectively. The value of this IPR&D is reviewed for impairment annually or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable. Product Quality and Recalls Product quality, particularly in life saving and sustaining technologies, plays a critical role in our success. A quality or safety issue may result in public warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made outside the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. Any of the foregoing events could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, recalls may negatively affect sales due to customer concerns about product quality. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 the net charges related to product recalls was not material. For fiscal year 2010 and 2009, our results were negatively affected by net charges for the cost of product recalls of $3 million and $19 million, respectively. We are operating under an amended consent decree with the FDA, related to our infusion pump business in the United States. We entered into a consent decree with the FDA in February 2007 related to our Alaris SE pumps, and in February 2009, we and the FDA amended the consent decree (amended consent decree) to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for CareFusion 303, Inc., our subsidiary that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the United States. The amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories. While we remain subject to the amended consent decree, which includes the requirements of the consent decree, we have made substantial progress in our compliance efforts. In accordance with the consent decree, we reconditioned Alaris SE pumps that had been seized by the FDA, remediated Alaris SE pumps in use by customers, and had an independent expert inspect the Alaris SE pump facilities and provide a certification to the FDA as to compliance. As result of these efforts, in January 2010, we announced that the FDA had given us permission to resume the manufacturing and marketing of our Alaris SE pumps. In accordance with the amended consent decree, and in addition to the requirements of the original consent decree, we also implemented a corrective action plan to bring the Alaris System and all other infusion pumps in use in the United States market into compliance, had our infusion pump facilities inspected by an independent expert, and had our recall procedures and all ongoing recalls involving our infusion pumps inspected by an independent recall expert. In July 2010, the FDA notified us that we can proceed to the audit inspection phase of the amended consent decree, which includes the requirement to retain an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of our infusion pump facilities. The amended consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing, recall products and take other actions. We may be required to pay damages of $15,000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree, up to $15 million per year. We cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter, whether additional amounts will be incurred to resolve this matter, if any, or the matters ultimate impact on our business. We have no reserve in connection with the amended consent decree to cover any future costs and expenses of compliance with the amended consent decree. As such, we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because, among other things, the FDA may 33 Table of Contents determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree, and or we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree. In response to infusion product recalls and the amended consent decree, we have made substantial investments in quality systems and quality personnel headcount over the past several years. While we believe that we have made significant improvements to our product quality and overall quality systems, further quality concerns, whether real or perceived, could adversely affect our results. Conversely, improving quality can be a competitive advantage and improve our results. Infusion Business and Market Developments Our consolidated results have also been affected by developments within our infusion business and the infusion market in the United States. For several months of fiscal year 2009, we placed a hold on shipping the Alaris System while we sought FDA clearance for a software correction. We received the required clearance in July 2009, and we subsequently resumed shipments. This shipping hold resulted in a negative impact on our infusion revenues in fiscal year 2009. When we released the shiphold in July 2009, we saw higher demand, which resulted in higher revenues for fiscal year 2010. In fiscal year 2011, we saw additional growth in our infusion business, driven in part by our acquisition of Medegen, but also by developments in the infusion market in the United States. Because of safety concerns, the FDA has increased its scrutiny of infusion pumps. During fiscal year 2011, three of our competitors recalled their infusion pumps to correct safety concerns. In addition, a fourth was ordered by the FDA to recall and destroy as many as 200,000 of its infusion pumps currently in use and to provide refunds to its customers or replace pumps at no cost. As a result, there has been increased demand for infusion pumps in the United States in fiscal year 2011, as healthcare providers seek to replace or upgrade their existing equipment. We have seen increased demand for our infusion pumps as a result, which has contributed to higher infusion revenues for fiscal year 2011. Income Taxes Prior to the spinoff, our operations were included in Cardinal Healths United States federal and state tax returns or non United States jurisdictions tax returns. In connection with the spinoff, we and Cardinal Health entered into a tax matters agreement that governs the parties respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes. The tax matters agreement generally provides that the control of audit proceedings and payment of any additional liability related to our business is our responsibility. For the period July 1, 2009 through the spinoff date from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009, our operations were included in the consolidated income tax returns of Cardinal Health, however, income taxes were calculated and provided for CareFusion on a separate return basis for fiscal years 2010 and 2009. The amount of liabilities related to income taxes prior to the spinoff that were retained by Cardinal Health are reflected in Parent Company Investment in the consolidated and combined statements of stockholders equity. Commencing with the period beginning September 1, 2009, we began to file stand alone income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, various United States state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. Basis of Presentation The audited consolidated and combined financial statements reflect the consolidated operations of CareFusion Corporation and its subsidiaries as a separate, stand alone entity subsequent to August 31, 2009. Periods presented prior to our August 31, 2009 spinoff from Cardinal Health have been prepared on a stand alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cardinal Health. Certain 34 Table of Contents lines of business that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the United States markets that were historically managed by us prior to the spinoff and were part of the clinical and medical products business of Cardinal Health, were retained by Cardinal Health as a result of the spinoff and are presented in these financial statements as discontinued operations. Our consolidated and combined financial statements do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods prior to the spinoff from Cardinal Health. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2010 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2011 2010 Change Revenue $ 3,528 $ 3,472 $ 56 Cost of Products Sold 1,723 1,740 (17 ) Gross Margin 1,805 1,732 73 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 1,103 1,121 (18 ) Research and Development Expenses 155 159 (4 ) Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 64 15 49 Gain on the Sale of Assets (13 ) (12 ) (1 ) Operating Income 496 449 47 Interest Expense and Other, Net 81 108 (27 ) Income Before Income Taxes 415 341 74 Provision for Income Taxes 124 183 (59 ) Income from Continuing Operations 291 158 133 Discontinued Operations Loss from the Disposal of Discontinued Businesses, Net of Tax (45 ) (8 ) (37 ) Income (Loss) from the Operations of Discontinued Businesses, Net of Tax (2 ) 44 (46 ) Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax (47 ) 36 (83 ) Net Income $ 244 $ 194 $ 50 Revenue Revenue in our Critical Care Technologies segment (CCT) increased 3% to $2,729 million compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased largely as a result of increased sales for our infusion and dispensing businesses, which was partially offset by decreased revenue for our respiratory business. Infusion revenues increased as a result of core business growth in both capital and disposable products and the year over year impact of our acquisition of Medegen in May 2010. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of the benefit during fiscal 2010 from the release of the shipping hold on the Alaris System in July 2009. Also affecting the year over year revenue change was the downward adjustment to revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 associated with a revised estimate of accrued rebates to distributors. Dispensing revenues increased primarily as a result of new business and competitive displacements. 35 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2010, respiratory product revenues were strong due to increased demand resulting from emergency preparedness efforts, including preparations for an anticipated severe flu season. As a result of restrained customer spending, a light flu season, and lower hospital admissions, we experienced lower capital product revenues and decreased utilization of our disposable respiratory products. Revenue in our Medical Technologies and Services segment (MT&S) decreased by 4% to $799 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of divesting our Onsite Services and Research Services businesses. These decreases were partially offset by growth in our infection prevention and medical specialties businesses. Gross Margin and Cost of Products Sold Gross margin increased 4%, to $1,805 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin was 51.2% and 49.9% for fiscal year 2011 and 2010, respectively. The overall increase in gross margin was primarily the result of higher sales associated with our infusion and dispensing businesses. Margin as a percentage of revenue increased as a result of favorable changes in product sales mix, with higher sales in our infusion and dispensing businesses, which generally have higher margins; and lower sales in our respiratory products business, which generally has lower margins. Also improving our gross margin percentage were the impacts of our 2011 Plan and favorable manufacturing cost reductions. Manufacturing savings resulted from: (a) cost benefits recognized through strategic sourcing of raw materials; (b) manufacturing efficiencies associated with lean transformation; and (c) reduced overhead spending. Selling, General and Administrative and Research and Development Expenses SG&A and Research and Development expenses decreased 2% to $1,258 million during fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily a result of savings associated with the 2011 Plan and reduced operating expenses associated with the divestiture of our Research Services business in May 2010. These decreases were partially offset by increased expenses associated with our acquisition of Medegen in May 2010 and increasing investment in our selling organization. Included within our SG&A expenses are certain one time costs associated with our spinoff from Cardinal Health of $50 million and $59 million for fiscal year 2011 and 2010, respectively. Expenditures associated with standing up operations from the spinoff were substantially complete as of the end of fiscal year 2011. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges Restructuring and acquisition integration charges increased $49 million to $64 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of charges associated with the 2011 Plan. We incurred charges of approximately $46 million during fiscal year 2011 associated with the 2011 Plan. In addition to the 2011 Plan, we periodically incur costs to implement smaller restructuring efforts for specific operations. These restructuring plans focus on various aspects of operations, including closing and consolidating certain manufacturing operations, rationalizing headcount and aligning operations in the most strategic and cost efficient structure. Gain on the Sale of Assets In March of fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of our Onsite Services business, which was historically part of our MT&S segment. The pre tax gain related to the disposition was approximately $15 million, which was partially offset by an adjustment to the gain on sale related to the fiscal 2010 sale of our Research Services business. See note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Operating Income Segment profit in our CCT reportable segment increased 10% to $434 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit was primarily driven by higher revenue in our infusion and dispensing businesses and reductions in overhead spending. Partially offsetting this increase were lower revenues from our respiratory businesses and the impact of increases in restructuring charges of $29 million. Segment profit in our MT&S reportable segment increased 17% to $49 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit is primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in revenue associated with our infection prevention and medical specialties businesses. Partially offsetting this increase was the impact of increases in restructuring charges of $21 million. Interest Expense and Other Interest expense and other, net decreased 25% to $81 million compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily related to a one time write off of debt issuance and related costs of $22 million associated with the bridge loan facility, which was terminated on August 31, 2009 and recorded during fiscal year 2010, as well as foreign currency gains and lower net interest expense in fiscal year 2011. In general, gains and losses resulting from foreign currency exchange rates are related to the remeasurement of receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary which holds the receivable or payable and are netted with any associated fair value hedging activities entered into to minimize this exposure. See note 15 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense decreased 32% to $124 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 was 30.0% compared to 53.7% for fiscal year 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in discrete tax expense in fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal year 2010, we completed a detailed analysis of our tax reserves prompted by new information related to our potential tax positions, tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. For this analysis, we retained third party advisors to assist in assessing whether, based on the new information, our tax risks had changed, and whether additional reserves in excess of those already recorded were necessary. Based on this analysis, we increased our existing reserves and recorded a change in estimate of approximately $58 million as a charge to net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. Also during fiscal year 2010, the disposition of our Research Services business resulted in additional tax expense, primarily due to the write off of non deductible goodwill associated with the disposition. We are currently under IRS audit for fiscal years 2003 through 2007, and we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 and for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. We continue to engage in substantive discussions with the IRS Appeals office related to our 2003 through 2005 fiscal years. It is reasonably possible that we will reach a favorable settlement with the IRS in relation to the fiscal years 2003 through 2005 within the next twelve months. We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for the matters under appeal with the IRS. However, if upon the conclusion of these audits, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount that is materially different than our current reserves, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate may be materially impacted in the period of adjustment. Generally, fluctuations in our effective tax rate are primarily due to changes within international and state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of restructuring and acquisition integration charges and other discrete items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item. The provision for income tax amounts calculated for periods prior to August 31, 2009 is not likely to be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for such periods. 37 Table of Contents For additional detail regarding the provision for income taxes, see note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax totaled $47 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to income from discontinued operations of $36 million for fiscal year 2010. The decrease is a result of a loss from the disposal of the International Surgical Products business, which we divested in fiscal year 2011. Additionally, included in discontinued operations in the prior year are (a) two months of results from certain lines of business that manufactured and sold surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the U.S. markets that were historically managed by us prior to the spinoff and were part of the clinical and medical products business of Cardinal Health, and were retained by Cardinal Health as a result of the spinoff, (b) results from the companys former Audiology business, which produced and marketed hearing diagnostic equipment, which was sold on October 1, 2009 and (c) results from the International Surgical Products business, which was sold on April 1, 2011. See note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information related to these discontinued operations. Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2009 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenue $ 3,472 $ 3,175 $ 297 Cost of Products Sold 1,740 1,569 171 Gross Margin 1,732 1,606 126 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 1,121 944 177 Research and Development Expenses 159 160 (1 ) Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 15 69 (54 ) Gain on the Sale of Assets (12 ) (12 ) Operating Income 449 433 16 Interest Expense and Other, Net 108 95 13 Income Before Income Tax 341 338 3 Provision for Income Tax 183 51 132 Income from Continuing Operations 158 287 (129 ) Discontinued Operations: Loss from the Disposal of Discontinued Businesses, Net of Tax (8 ) (8 ) Income from the Operations of Discontinued Businesses, Net of Tax 44 281 (237 ) Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 36 281 (245 ) Net Income $ 194 $ 568 $ (374 ) Revenue Revenue in our CCT segment increased by $215 million, or 9%, to $2,644 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue was attributable to increased sales in our respiratory products, primarily ventilators and disposables, as a result of emergency preparedness during fiscal year 2010, including the potential effects of influenza viruses. In addition, revenues increased as a result of the impact of commercial 38 Table of Contents agreements executed in conjunction with our separation from Cardinal Health. Our infusion product revenues increased largely as a result of the net impact of the release of the shipping hold on the Alaris System that began in February 2009 and ended in July 2009 and the fulfillment of previously delayed customer orders that resulted from the shipping hold. However, infusion revenues were negatively impacted by delays in hospital capital spending, primarily for the first six months of fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009. Dispensing equipment revenues declined due to the impact of delays in hospital capital spending through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2010, as well as the way in which hospitals prioritize and allocate their spending. Revenue in our MT&S segment increased by $82 million, or 11%, to $828 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue increase is attributable to growth in our interventional specialties products business, and growth in our infection prevention products business. Interventional specialties growth primarily resulted from increased sales of chronic drainage products. Gross Margin and Cost of Products Sold Gross margin increased $126 million, or 8%, to $1,732 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin was 49.9% and 50.6% of revenue for fiscal year 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to sales growth, combined with the favorable impacts in manufacturing costs. Manufacturing savings resulting from: (a) improved utilization of raw materials; (b) the impact of relocating certain of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers to lower cost jurisdictions; (c) favorable overhead absorption as a result of increased volume; and (d) controlled overhead spending. Also affecting the increase were infusion product recall charges for $18 million that impacted the quarter ended March 31, 2009 associated with the Alaris System shipping hold. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased year over year. This was the result of the manufacturing efficiencies noted above, offset by a product mix that includes a higher proportion of respiratory sales, which generally have lower margins than our other capital equipment businesses. Selling, General and Administrative and Research and Development Expenses SG&A and Research and Development expenses increased $176 million, or 16%, to $1,280 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in SG&A is attributable to incremental operating costs related to standing up certain corporate functions; one time costs associated with our spinoff from Cardinal Health of $59 million; and increases in discretionary variable compensation and share based compensation of $82 million. Partially offsetting these increases are the favorable impacts of our March 2009 global workforce reduction program of $47 million. SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2009 include allocated costs to us by Cardinal Health of $406 million. Included within the $406 million is $21 million of expenses associated with discontinued operations. Allocated SG&A expenses include expenses for shared functions, including management, finance, financial shared services, human resources, information technology, legal, legislative affairs and management incentive plan expenses. SG&A expenses historically allocated to us for periods prior to August 31, 2009 are not likely to be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for such periods. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges Restructuring and acquisition integration charges decreased $54 million, or 78%, to $15 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal year 2009, we launched a series of restructuring programs with the goal to provide improved management focus through the re alignment of the management structure and 39 Table of Contents lowering its cost structure through a reduction in global workforce. During fiscal year 2010, we recorded $5 million of expense associated with these restructuring programs. In total, we recorded $61 million of expense for these restructuring programs, and as of March 31, 2010, all major activities of these programs have been completed. During fiscal year 2009, restructuring charges were primarily comprised of employee related and facility exit restructuring charges of $57 million, and acquisition integration expenses of $12 million were primarily related to our 2007 acquisition of Viasys. Gain on the Sale of Assets In May 2010, we completed the sale of our Research Services business, which was historically part of our MT&S segment, for $81 million in cash. Including estimated working capital adjustments as part of the definitive agreement, the pre tax gain related to the disposition was approximately $12 million, or $1 million loss after tax. Income tax expense associated with the transaction was impacted by approximately $24 million of goodwill assigned to the disposition that was not deductible for tax purposes. Operating Income Operating income for fiscal year 2010 increased $16 million, or 4%, to $449 million. The increase in operating income was due to a reduction of restructuring and acquisition integration charges, the pre tax gain on the sale of our Research Services business, and higher sales and associated margin. Partially offsetting these increases are higher SG&A expenses, primarily associated with one time and incremental expenses related to standing up as a public company. Segment profit in our CCT reportable segment increased by $41 million, or 12%, to $395 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit is attributable to higher sales in our infusion and respiratory businesses, decreases in restructuring and integration charges, and a decrease in infusion product recall charges relative to the $18 million product recall charge recorded for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. Segment profit in our MT&S reportable segment decreased by $37 million, or 47%, to $42 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in segment profit is primarily attributable to the timing and increase of SG&A expenses. The decreases were partially offset by incremental gross margin and reductions in restructuring and acquisition integration expenses. Interest Expense and Other Interest expense and other, net for fiscal year 2010 increased $13 million, or 14%, to $108 million. The increase is attributable to a one time write off of debt issuance and related costs of $22 million associated with the bridge loan facility, which was terminated on August 31, 2009, and to a lesser extent, the difference in interest expense for our outstanding senior notes compared to interest expense associated with the allocated debt from Cardinal Health in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in foreign currency exchange losses of $23 million during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009. In general, gains and losses resulting from foreign currency exchange rates are related to the remeasurement of receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary that holds the receivable or payable. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for fiscal year 2010 increased $132 million to $183 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2010 was 53.7% compared to 15.1% for fiscal year 2009. The change in expense and effective tax rates in aggregate were primarily the result of charges recorded during fiscal year 2010, as compared to benefits recorded during fiscal year 2009. 40 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2010, we increased our existing tax reserves by approximately $58 million, which was recorded as a charge to net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. Also during fiscal year 2010, the disposition of our Research Services business resulted in additional tax expense primarily due to the write off of non deductible goodwill associated with the disposition. During fiscal year 2009, a claim was filed by Cardinal Health with the IRS to amend the filing position taken on its United States federal income tax return for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 related to a secured loan transaction involving certain of our sales type lease receivables. Since our income taxes are presented on a separate return basis, we recognized a net tax benefit in the quarter ended March 31, 2009, related to this item. Also during fiscal year 2009, a benefit was recorded due to the impact of changes in state tax laws and a change in the estimated values of our deferred income tax liabilities due to the separation from Cardinal Health. For additional detail regarding the provision for income taxes, see note 13 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for fiscal year 2010 decreased 87% to $36 million compared to the prior fiscal year. Included in discontinued operations for fiscal year 2010 and 2009 are (a) certain lines of business that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the United States markets that were historically managed by us prior to the spinoff and were part of the clinical and medical products business of Cardinal Health, and were retained by Cardinal Health as a result of the spinoff, (b) the Audiology business, which produces and markets hearing diagnostic equipment, which was sold on October 1, 2009; and (c) the International Surgical Products business, which was sold on April 1, 2011. The net income earned by the businesses retained by Cardinal Health upon the spinoff is included within our income from discontinued operations until the date of our spinoff of August 31, 2009, or two months in fiscal year 2010; whereas the net income earned by these businesses for the entire fiscal year 2009 is included within our income from discontinued operations for that same period. The significant decrease in our income from discontinued operations is primarily due to the difference in the number of periods the businesses retained by Cardinal Health were included within our results in fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009. Additionally, during fiscal year 2010, we recorded losses associated with the sale of the Audiology business. See note 2 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Historically, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, positive cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations primarily represents inflows from net income (adjusted for depreciation and other non cash items) and outflows from investment in sales type leases entered into, as we sell and install dispensing equipment, and other increases in working capital needed to grow the business. Cash flows from investing activities represent our investment in intellectual property and capital equipment required to grow our business, as well as acquisitions. In fiscal year 2011, cash flows from financing activities are primarily related to changes in investments in discontinued operations. Prior to our spinoff, Cardinal Health would fund our operating and investing activities as needed and transfer our excess cash at its discretion. Our cash balance at June 30, 2011 was $1,371 million. Of this balance, $1,130 million is held outside of the United States and is denominated in United States dollars as well as other currencies. We believe that our current domestic cash flow from operations and domestic cash balances are sufficient to meet domestic operating needs. It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in order to ensure sufficient working capital and expand existing operations outside the United States. Additionally, we intend to fund foreign acquisitions primarily through the use of unrepatriated cash held by foreign subsidiaries. However, should our domestic cash needs exceed our current or future domestic cash flows, we could repatriate foreign cash or utilize our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, both of which would result in increased expense. 41 Table of Contents We believe that our future cash from operations together with our access to funds available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and new business development activities. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table summarizes our consolidated and combined statements of cash flows from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash Flow Provided by/(Used in) Operating Activities $ 335 $ 659 $ 528 Investing Activities $ (18 ) $ (254 ) $ (130 ) Financing Activities $ 32 $ (12 ) $ (207 ) Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010 Net operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased $324 million to $335 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the prior year. The decrease is due to the impact of cash outflows associated with other accrued liabilities and operating items ($394 million) primarily attributable to changes in income taxes payable, increases in uncertain tax position reserves, and employee incentive compensation that was accrued at June 30, 2010 and paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. At June 30, 2011, accrued employee incentive compensation balances are significantly lower than similar accruals at June 30, 2010. Additionally, there was a decrease in cash flow associated with accounts receivable as a result of temporary delays in collections as a result of new system implementations ($146 million) and a decrease in cash flow associated with inventory ($106 million). These decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by increases in income from continuing operations ($133 million) and the impact of non cash items ($174 million), primarily attributable to changes in deferred income taxes. Net cash used in continuing operations from investing activities decreased $236 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the prior year primarily due to a reduction in amounts paid for acquisitions and an increase in amounts received for divestitures. During the year ended June 30, 2011 we purchased Vestara and divested our OnSite and International Surgical Products businesses. Net cash provided by continuing operations from financing activities increased $44 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the prior year. During the year ended June 30, 2010, we received proceeds from the issuance of debt ($1,378 million) and utilized these proceeds to pay a dividend to Cardinal Health ($1,374 million) associated with our spinoff. The remaining year over year change was primarily due to the change in amounts transferred to us from Cardinal Health before our spinoff ($46 million), partially offset by transfers with our International Surgical Products business ($65 million), and our payments of debt issuance costs ($29 million) during the year ended June 30, 2010. Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $131 million to $659 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to increased cash flows associated with other accrued liabilities and operating items ($256 million), primarily related to an increase in uncertain tax position reserves, the timing of recognition of certain deferred tax items through our current tax provision and taxes payable, and accruals for employee related liabilities; increases in cash flows associated with accounts payable ($32 million), primarily due to longer payment cycles at the end of fiscal year 2010 compared 42 Table of Contents to fiscal year 2009 to enhance our cash positions; and the impacts of converting inventory balances ($51 million), primarily related to the release of the shipping hold on the Alaris System. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in cash flows associated with accounts receivable ($63 million). The decrease in cash flow associated with accounts receivable is primarily a result of longer collection periods with Cardinal Health. Prior to the spinoff, accounts receivables from Cardinal Health were considered to be settled for cash immediately, as they were intercompany balances. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations increased $124 million to $254 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to the purchase of Medegen ($224 million) and increases in capital expenditures ($13 million). The increase was partially offset by proceeds from the divestitures of our Research Services business ($81 million) and Audiology business ($27 million). Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations decreased $195 million to $12 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the prior fiscal year. Within financing activities, we incurred indebtedness with a face value of $1.4 billion in connection with the spinoff from Cardinal Health. On August 31, 2009, we used the proceeds of this debt of $1.374 billion to pay a dividend to Cardinal Health, and as a result, those proceeds were not available for our business needs. Financing activities prior to fiscal year 2010 were primarily related to cash receipts and disbursements between us and Cardinal Health to fund business operations as a component of Cardinal Health. Capital Resources Senior Unsecured Notes. On July 14, 2009, we offered and sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and received net proceeds of $1.374 billion. As part of the spinoff, the net proceeds were subsequently distributed as a dividend payment to Cardinal Health. The indenture for the senior notes limits our ability to incur certain secured debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. In accordance with the indenture, we may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a price that would equal or exceed the outstanding principal balance, as defined. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and experience a below investment grade rating event, we may be required to repurchase all of the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal balance plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC to conduct an exchange offer for the notes. In accordance with the registration rights agreement, we filed a Form S 4 with the SEC and conducted an exchange offer for the notes, which we completed on February 4, 2010. The purpose of the exchange offer was to allow the holders of the senior notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction and were subject to transfer restrictions, to exchange their notes for new notes that did not have these restrictions and are registered under the Securities Act. All of the outstanding senior notes were exchanged in the exchange offer. Following the exchange offer, we continue to have $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding. Revolving Credit Facilities. During fiscal year 2011, we maintained two senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, as follows: $240 million 364 day revolving credit facility (which expired on August 30, 2010); and $480 million three year revolving credit facility (maturing August 31, 2012) At June 30, 2011, we had no amounts outstanding under our three year revolving credit facility. On July 6, 2011, we entered into a new five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility and terminated the existing three year facility. The new five year credit facility has an aggregate available principal amount of $550 43 Table of Contents million, and matures on July 6, 2016. At our request and subject to certain conditions, the commitments under the facility may be increased by up to $200 million to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments. Borrowings under the five year credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum based upon the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate or the alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin, which varies based upon CareFusions debt ratings. The five year credit facility also requires us to pay a quarterly commitment fee to the lenders under the credit facility on the amount of the lenders unused commitments thereunder based upon CareFusions debt ratings. The five year credit facility contains several customary covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, dispositions, and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.50:1.00 as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.50:1.00 as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters. The credit facility is subject to customary events of default, including, but not limited to, non payment of principal or other amounts when due, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross default to other material indebtedness, certain ERISA related events, certain voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy events, and change of control. Bridge Loan Facility. On July 1, 2009, we entered into a senior unsecured bridge loan facility (the bridge loan facility) to provide financing for an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, with a term of 364 days from the date of any funding, for payment of the dividend to Cardinal Health as part of our spinoff. As the senior unsecured note offering was successfully completed prior to the separation, those proceeds were used to finance the payment of the dividend to Cardinal Health in lieu of drawing on the bridge loan facility. As a result, the bridge loan facility was terminated on August 31, 2009. In connection with this termination, we expensed approximately $22 million of capitalized fees to interest expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2009. Dividends We currently intend to retain any earnings to finance research and development, acquisitions and the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any dividends in the future by us will be subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Moreover, should we pay any dividend in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2011, our contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by fiscal year, are as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year (in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Long Term Debt1 $ $ 250 $ 450 $ 700 $ 1,400 Capital Lease Obligations2 1 1 2 Other Long Term Liabilities3 68 33 10 5 116 Interest on Long Term Debt4 78 137 93 142 450 Operating Leases5 38 62 39 20 159 Purchase Obligations6 255 18 2 1 276 Total Financial Obligations $ 440 $ 501 $ 594 $ 868 $ 2,403 44 Table of Contents 1 Represents maturities of our long term debt obligations, excluding capital lease obligations described below, as described in note 12 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. Amounts are presented gross of debt issuance discounts of $14 million at June 30, 2011. 2 Represents maturities of our capital lease obligations included within long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet and the related estimated future interest payments. 3 Represents cash outflows by period for certain of our long term liabilities in which cash outflows could be reasonably estimated. Certain long term liabilities, such as unrecognized tax benefits of $289 million and deferred taxes of $644 million, tax associated accruals of $109 million, deferred compensation obligations of $15 million and other long term liabilities of $17 million, have been excluded from the table above because of the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflow. See note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information. 4 Interest obligation is calculated based on each outstanding debt stated or coupon rate, or existing variable rate as of June 30, 2011, as applicable. 5 Represents minimum rental payments and the related estimated future interest payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms as described in note 14 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. 6 Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including the following: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. In addition, contracts that can be unilaterally cancelled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period. In addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, we expect that we will make payments to the IRS related to ongoing appeals of prior tax years under audit. During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, we began substantive discussions with the IRS Appeals office related to our 2003 through 2005 fiscal tax years, which were previously under audit. We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for the matters under appeal with the IRS. However, if upon the conclusion of these audits, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount that is materially different than our current reserves, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate may be materially impacted in the period of adjustment. Further, even if we are adequately reserved for these matters, final settlement would require us to make a cash payment to the IRS, which could be material. If we determine to repatriate foreign cash or utilize our revolving credit facility to fund the payment to the IRS, it may result in increased costs. See note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. In July 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Rowa, a Germany based company specializing in robotic medication storage and retrieval systems for retail and hospital pharmacies, for approximately $150 million. We completed this acquisition on August 1, 2011, which we funded with existing cash and funds generated from operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At June 30, 2011, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our audited consolidated and combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The preparation of these audited consolidated and 45 Table of Contents combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant effect on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience, trends, and managements judgment. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and believe our estimates to be reasonable. Other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our audited consolidated and combined financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue through the sale and lease of equipment, software, services, medical products, supplies, and the income associated with the financing of our equipment leases. We recognize revenue when: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; product delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends on a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized may involve subjective or complex judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. The significant judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and could result in material differences under other assumptions and conditions are those described below. Evaluation of the Significance of Embedded Software We sell and lease products with embedded software. We regularly review these products to determine whether embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole. If the embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole, the product is classified as a software product unless it is determined that the tangible elements and software elements of the product work together to deliver the essential functionality of the product as a whole. We consider the following characteristics to be indicators that embedded software is more than incidental to the product as whole: software is a significant focus of the marketing effort or the software application is sold separately; significant internally developed software costs have been incurred; and if we provide telephone support, bug fixes, and or unspecified upgrades specific to the embedded software. The evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment as the products exhibit varying degrees of the indicators identified above, such as: certain products are marketed as systems or solutions wherein it is implied, but not explicitly stated within marketing and sales collateral, that embedded software provides the basis for significant functionalities identified within the marketing efforts; internal software development costs are incurred during the product development process; 46 Table of Contents separately priced extended warranty services provide post installation support relative to repair parts and services and also include telephone support and bug fixes for the software embedded within the products; and we are required by law to provide medical safety related bug fixes for products with embedded software elements. In evaluating whether the tangible elements and software elements of the product together deliver the essential functionality of the product as a whole, we consider the following factors: the frequency in which tangible elements are sold separately from the software elements; and whether the non software elements substantively contribute to the essential functionality of the product. Although we believe the software embedded within our infusion products, when sold with safety software, patient identification products, and certain diagnostic equipment is more than incidental to the product as a whole, the tangible elements and software elements work together to deliver the essential functionality of these products as a whole and therefore these products are not classified as software. We have determined the embedded software within our other products, primarily our dispensing and respiratory products, is incidental to the products as a whole. Those products are therefore not classified as software. Generally, we classify our stand alone software application sales and any related post contract support related to these sales as software. Revenue Recognition for Leases Our accounting for leases involves specific determinations under applicable lease accounting standards, which often involve complex and prescriptive provisions. If a lease qualifies as a sales type capital lease, equipment revenue is recognized upon delivery or installation of the equipment as opposed to ratably over the lease term. Therefore, our lease classification procedures significantly affect the timing of revenue recognition. The critical element we consider in determining the classification of our lease transactions is the fair value of the leased equipment, including its estimated fair value at the inception and conclusion of the lease, and the estimated useful life of our equipment. For the purposes of determining the fair value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease, we apply the following discounts against the purchase list price: (a) the percentage discount from list prices provided regardless of a customers intent to lease or purchase and (b) an incremental discount provided exclusively to lease customers. This methodology assumes that purchase customers are provided similar discounts in (a) above as lease customers. Periodically, we review discount levels provided to purchase customers and lease customers to validate this assumption. We estimate the useful life of our equipment based upon actual historical data which identifies the length of time our equipment has been in place and in service at customer facilities. Multiple Element Arrangements The majority of our transactions qualify as multiple element arrangements. We use the relative selling price method to allocate contract proceeds to non software products, which are then individually recognized to revenue. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available, or managements estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is available. The determination of vendor specific objective evidence estimates associated with our products and services is generally based on historical evidence of sales of the same product in stand alone transactions and the contract renewal prices for post contract support and separately priced extended warranty services. The determination of third party evidence is generally based on market data on sales of similar products and services, if available; 47 Table of Contents however in most cases we and our competitors execute large multiple element arrangements which reduces our ability to determine the prices for individual products and services. Managements best estimate of selling price is developed consistent with the price at which we would transact if the deliverable were sold by the vendor regularly on a stand alone basis. In determining estimated selling price, we generally consider the following: stand alone sales prices, established price lists, costs to produce, profit margins for similar products, market conditions, and customer stratification. For software and software related products, we use the relative fair value method to allocate contract proceeds to each unit of accounting; whereby the evidence used in the determination of fair value estimates are based solely on vendor specific objective evidence. To the extent that fair value evidence does not exist for delivered elements of the transaction, we apply the residual method. Different conclusions as to the existence and valuation of selling price estimates may significantly affect the timing and valuation of revenue recognition, the classification of leasing transactions, and the classification of revenue as product, service, rental or other income. It is impossible to determine the effects of potential different conclusions as they relate to the existence or valuation of selling price estimates. Business Combinations Assumptions and estimates are used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets, which requires management to use significant judgment in determining fair value. Current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is affected by purchase price allocations and by the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles, excluding goodwill. We believe the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. In conjunction with the review of a transaction, the status of the acquired companys research and development projects is assessed to determine the existence of IPR&D. In connection with certain acquisitions, we are required to estimate the fair value of acquired IPR&D, which requires selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project. Management also assesses the current status of development, nature and timing of efforts to complete such development, uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value. Costs are not assigned to IPR&D unless future development is probable. Beginning with acquisitions completed on or after July 1, 2009, IPR&D is recorded as an unamortized intangible asset until the underlying products are either completed and put into service, which would require commencing amortization over the estimated product life, or determining the products will not complete development, which would require impairing the portion of IPR&D associated with that product. Until either determination is made, IPR&D is subject to periodic impairment review, with impairments, if any, expensed to our consolidated and combined statement of income. During fiscal year 2010, we completed the acquisition of Medegen, which resulted in approximately $45 million of IPR&D associated with new products under development being recorded as an intangible asset. The timing and recognition of both the in service date for these products as well as the potential of impairment involves significant judgment. Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually, and whenever indicators of impairment exist. Intangibles with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable. In conducting the annual impairment test of our goodwill, the fair value of our reporting units is compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to assess impairment. We perform our impairment testing at the operating segment level. There are no fluid active or inactive markets for our operating 48 Table of Contents segments to derive approximate fair values, and accordingly, the valuation process is similar to the valuation of a closely held company and considers valuation methods that are income based and market based. Our income based approach is a discounted cash flow method which utilizes an estimated discount rate to the projected after tax cash flows for the operating segment. Our market based approach utilizes an estimated market based multiple to the operating segments estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The results of the income based and market based approaches are equally weighted to arrive at the total estimated fair value for each operating segment. Based on our annual impairment test as of April 1, 2011, we did not record any goodwill impairments. The application of valuation methods requires significant judgment regarding appropriate inputs and assumptions and results in our best estimate of the fair value of an operating segment. As with any estimate, inputs and assumptions can be subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. Informed market participants can differ in their perception of value for a reporting unit. It is possible that one of our operating segments could experience goodwill impairment in the future. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges We separately identify restructuring and acquisition integration charges in SG&A expenses. A restructuring activity is a program whereby we fundamentally change our operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Acquisition integration charges are activities and costs to integrate acquired companies into the operations of our existing activities, including such functions as selling, manufacturing, information systems, and corporate related functions. The majority of the charges related to restructuring and acquisition integration can be classified in one of the following categories: employee related costs, exit costs (including lease termination costs), asset impairments, and other integration costs. Employee related costs include severance and termination benefits. Lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees, forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income. Other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility. Asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of our assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities. See note 5 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information. Provision for Income Taxes Prior to August 31, 2009, our income taxes as presented are calculated on a separate tax return basis, although our operations were historically included in Cardinal Healths United States federal and state tax returns or non United States jurisdictions tax returns. Cardinal Healths global tax model was developed based on its entire portfolio of businesses. Accordingly, our tax results for periods prior to August 31, 2009 are not necessarily reflective of the results that we would have generated on a stand alone basis. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and measurement of uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated and combined financial statements. The proper treatment of various tax issues, including transfer pricing, are subjective determinations that depend on the specific facts and circumstances at issue. To estimate contingent tax reserves, management first concludes whether our positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The reserve is then determined by evaluating and weighing the technical 49 Table of Contents merits of alternative methodologies against each other and concluding on the positions that provide the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate resolution. To the extent there are any administrative or case law developments that provide additional evidence in favor or against the valuation methodologies utilized, the contingent tax reserve will be adjusted in the period that such developments occur. Loss Contingencies We accrue for contingencies related to litigation and other claims arising out of our business based on degree of probability and range of possible loss. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the consolidated and combined financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these claims are often inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Share Based Compensation We maintain a stock incentive plan that provides for awards of non qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units for the benefit of certain of our officers, directors and employees. At the time of the spinoff, Cardinal Health converted or adjusted outstanding stock options, restricted shares and restricted share units (collectively, share based awards) with respect to Cardinal Health common shares held by Cardinal Health and CareFusion employees. The manner of conversion for each employee was determined based on the date of the original share based award and the employment status of the employee at the spinoff date of August 31, 2009. We record share based compensation expense for the share based awards held by our employees, regardless of whether such share based awards are based on common stock of CareFusion or common shares of Cardinal Health, with the offsetting impact recorded to Additional Paid In Capital in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the stock options granted during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, was estimated by Cardinal Health utilizing a Lattice valuation model. The fair value of stock options granted by CareFusion during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, and subsequent to the spinoff, was estimated by CareFusion utilizing a Black Scholes Merton valuation model. The fair value of performance stock units granted by CareFusion during fiscal year 2011 was estimated by CareFusion utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model. Our estimate of fair value depends on a complex process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events. These events, estimates of which are entered within the valuation model include, but are not limited to, stock price volatility, the expected life, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rates. Once fair values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results. We are required to compare our estimated share based forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary. See note 20 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information regarding share based compensation including the valuation process. New Accounting Pronouncements See note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage these risks using hedging strategies that involve the use of derivative instruments. We do not enter into any derivative agreements for trading or speculative purposes. While we believe we have designed an effective risk management program, there are inherent limitations in our ability to forecast our exposures, and therefore, we cannot guarantee that our programs will completely mitigate all risks associated with unfavorable movement in either foreign exchange rates or interest rates. Additionally, the timing of the recognition of gains and losses related to derivative instruments can be different from the recognition of the underlying economic exposure. This may impact our consolidated operating results and financial position. Interest Rate Risk Interest income and expense on variable rate instruments are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates across the world. Changes in interest rates primarily affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents and to a significantly lesser extent the interest expense on our debt. As of June 30, 2011, the majority of our outstanding debt balances is fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on this debt, interest on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations as the rate on this facility is variable. At June 30, 2011 we had no amount outstanding under our $480 million three year revolving credit facility.

The fair value of our senior notes at June 30, 2011 and 2010 was based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the other obligations at June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, was based on either the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt and the current interest rates offered for debt or estimated based on discounted cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk We are a global company with operations in multiple countries and are a net recipient of currencies other than the United States dollar (USD). Accordingly, a strengthening of the USD will negatively impact revenues and gross margins expressed in consolidated USD terms. Currently, we have foreign exchange risk associated with currency exposure associated with existing assets and liabilities, committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk by using derivative contracts such as forwards, swaps and options with financial institutions to hedge our risks. In general, we will hedge material foreign exchange exposures up to twelve months in advance; however, we may choose not to hedge some exposures for a variety of reasons including prohibitive economic costs. The realized and unrealized gains and losses of foreign currency forward contracts and the re measurement of foreign denominated receivables, payables and loans are recorded in the consolidated statement of income. To the extent that cash flow hedges qualify for hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the forward contract will be recorded to OCI. As the forecasted exposures affect earnings, the realized gain or loss on the forward contract will be moved from OCI to the consolidated and combined statements of income. 52 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding as of June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010: June 30, 2011 June 30, 2010 (in millions) NotionalAmount AverageContractRate NotionalAmount AverageContractRate Foreign Currency Forward Contracts: (Receive USD/pay foreign currency) Euro $ 153 1.4 $ 12 1.4 Australian Dollar 36 1.0 19 0.9 New Zealand Dollar 9 0.8 9 0.7 South African Rand 2 7.2 2 7.7 Norwegian Krone 2 5.9 Swedish Krona 2 7.1 Mexico Peso 7 12.0 2 13.0 Canadian Dollar 1 1.0 5 1.0 Japanese Yen 1 89.3 Swiss Franc 3 0.9 British Pound 47 1.6 Total $ 258 $ 54 Estimated Fair Value $ $ 1 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts: (Pay USD/receive foreign currency) Mexican Peso $ 33 12.0 $ 10 13.0 Swiss Franc 14 0.9 5 1.1 British Pound 1 1.6 19 1.5 Canadian Dollar 1 1.0 Euro 8 1.4 Total $ 48 $ 43 Estimated Fair Value $ 1 $ Foreign Currency Forward Contracts: (Pay foreign currency/receive euros) British Pound $ 7 0.9 $ 2 0.8 Swiss Franc 18 1.4 Total $ 7 $ 20 Estimated Fair Value $ $ Commodity Price Risk Management We purchase commodities such as resins, printed circuit boards, latex, various fuel products and polystyrene, among others for use in our manufacturing processes.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) presented below refer to and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to CareFusion Corporation, CareFusion, we, us, our and our company refer to CareFusion Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. References in this Annual Report on Form 10 K to Cardinal Health refers to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Overview We are a global medical technology company with clinically proven and industry leading products and services designed to measurably improve the safety, quality, efficiency and cost of healthcare. We offer comprehensive product lines in the areas of IV infusion, medication and supply dispensing, respiratory care, infection prevention and surgical instruments to customers in the United States and over 130 countries throughout the world. Our strategy is to enhance growth by focusing on healthcare safety and productivity, driving innovation and clinical differentiation, accelerating our global growth and pursing strategic opportunities. Our primary customers in the United States include hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, clinics, long term care facilities and physician offices. For each of fiscal years 2011 and 2010, we generated revenue of $3.5 billion. We generated income from continuing operations of $291 million in fiscal year 2011 and $158 million in fiscal year 2010. Approximately 20% of our fiscal year 2011 revenue was from customers outside of the United States. Separation from Cardinal Health, Inc. We were incorporated in Delaware on January 14, 2009 for the purpose of holding Cardinal Health, Inc.s clinical and medical products businesses in anticipation of spinning off from Cardinal Health. We completed the spinoff from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009. In connection with the spinoff, Cardinal Health contributed the majority of the businesses comprising its clinical and medical products segment to us and distributed approximately 81% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 179.8 million shares, to its shareholders. Cardinal Health retained approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 41.4 million shares, in connection with the spinoff. As of September 15, 2010, Cardinal Health had sold all remaining shares of our common stock retained in connection with the spinoff. We have incurred one time expenditures in connection with the separation from Cardinal Health (capital and expense), primarily associated with employee related costs, costs to start up certain stand alone functions and information technology systems and other one time transaction related costs. In fiscal years 2011 and 2010, we incurred approximately $80 million and $120 million, respectively, of these one time expenditures. While we expect to continue to incur some additional expenditures related to the separation in fiscal 2012, we believe that all substantive expenditures associated with standing up operations from the spinoff are complete. We have funded, and expect to continue funding these costs through cash from operations and cash on hand. The capital portion of these expenditures will be amortized over their useful lives and the other expenditures will be expensed as incurred, depending on their nature. Additionally, we have incurred increased costs as an independent, publicly traded company, primarily as a result of higher charges than in the past from Cardinal Health for transition services and from establishing or expanding the corporate support for our businesses, including information technology, human resources, treasury, tax, risk management, accounting and financial reporting, investor relations, legal, procurement and other services. We believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these additional corporate expenses going forward. 30 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations The Overall Global Economic Environment, Industry Growth and Trends Healthcare related industries are generally less susceptible than some other industries to fluctuations in the overall economic environment. However, some of our businesses rely on capital spending from our customers (primarily hospitals), which can be influenced by a variety of economic factors, including interest rates, access to financing and endowment fluctuations. Significant changes in these economic factors can affect the sales of our capital equipment products, such as infusion pumps, dispensing equipment and ventilators. Additionally, sales volumes for some of our businesses are dependent on hospital admissions. Changes in admissions due to difficult economic times can affect our results for surgical and single use products, such as infusion and respiratory disposable sets, surgical instruments and skin antiseptic products. Since the beginning of fiscal year 2009, challenges have existed in the capital equipment market from delays in hospital capital spending, as well as prioritization of capital spending. Despite seeing small signs of improvement, we continue to anticipate it will take some time before significant market improvements are realized. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to benefit from increases in hospital capital equipment spending as the market recovers over time. During fiscal year 2010, the healthcare industry was impacted by emergency preparedness efforts related to H1N1 and an anticipated severe flu season. This drove higher demand for our respiratory products in fiscal year 2010. While this demand benefited us in fiscal year 2010, our respiratory business continues to face a challenging capital spending market. In fiscal year 2011, as a result of a lighter than expected flu season and lower hospital admissions, we saw a negative impact on demand for our respiratory products. Healthcare Reform We are also affected by uncertainties in the healthcare industry related to healthcare reform. In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare reform was enacted in the United States through the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Acts. In addition, we anticipate that the current presidential administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. The uncertainties regarding the implementation and impact of the enacted healthcare reform measures, as well as other potential reform initiatives in the future, may have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and services. Global Restructuring During fiscal year 2011 our operations were impacted by our global restructuring program. This program, announced in August 2010 (the 2011 Plan), was designed to reduce our cost structure and streamline operations, and was initially expected to result in a reduction of approximately 700 positions. The 2011 Plan resulted in a reduction of approximately 850 positions in fiscal 2011. This program provided operating expense savings of approximately $103 million in fiscal year 2011, primarily as a result of reducing headcount and eliminating unfilled positions. Of the $103 million of savings, approximately $65 million was a result of year over year savings in selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) and lower cost of sales expense, and $38 million was a result of not filling open positions. The 2011 plan is expected to result in incremental savings of approximately $25 million in fiscal year 2012. Initiation of this program resulted in approximately $46 million of restructuring charges during fiscal year 2011. Innovation and New Products Our business strategy relies significantly on innovation to develop and introduce new products and to differentiate our products from our competitors. Our investment expense in research and development during 31 Table of Contents fiscal year 2011 was $155 million, or 4% of revenues. Looking forward, we remain committed to producing a pipeline of innovative products to continue to support our growth strategies. We plan to increase our research and development expenditures with internal initiatives, as well as licensing or acquiring technology from third parties. Our internal and external investments will be focused on initiatives that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. With a significant investment in research and development, a strong focus on innovation and a well managed innovation process, we believe we can continue to innovate and grow. If, however, our future innovations are not successful in meeting customers needs or prove to be too costly versus their perceived benefit, our growth may slow. International and Foreign Exchange We sell our products in more than 130 countries and manufacture our products in nine countries in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Due to the global nature of our business, our revenue and expenses are influenced by foreign exchange movements. In fiscal year 2011, approximately 22% of our sales were in currencies other than the United States dollar. Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar compared to other currencies will affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into United States dollars. The percentage of fiscal year 2011 sales by major currencies was as follows: United States Dollar 78 % Euro 11 % British Pound 4 % All Other 7 % 100 % Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions have historically played a role in our growth, and we have made several significant acquisitions in the last five years. Our business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions by Cardinal Health of established healthcare companies, including the acquisition of VIASYS Healthcare Inc. (Viasys) in 2007, and the assets of Enturia, Inc. (Enturia) in 2008. Since our separation from Cardinal Health, we have taken steps to expand our product offerings through acquisitions. In May 2010, we acquired Medegen, a manufacturer of clinically differentiated IV needleless access valves and administration sets, and in April 2011, we acquired Vestara, a developer of technology solutions that enable the safe, efficient disposal and tracking of environmentally sensitive pharmaceutical waste. In August 2011, we completed our acquisition of Rowa, a Germany based company specializing in robotic medication storage and retrieval systems for retail and hospital pharmacies. While we believe that the integration of the businesses we have acquired have generally been successful, our failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully might negatively affect our results. Our strategy also involves assessing our portfolio of businesses with a view of divesting non core businesses that do not align with our objectives, such as the divestitures of our Audiology business in October 2009, and our Research Services business in May 2010. During fiscal year 2011, we also divested our International Surgical Products business and our Onsite Services business. The results of our Audiology business and our International Surgical Products business are reflected in discontinued operations in the financial information included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10 K. See note 2 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. Acquired In Process Research and Development During fiscal year 2010 we acquired and capitalized $45 million of in process research and development (IPR&D), related to our acquisition of Medegen. The value of this IPR&D was calculated based on a discounted cash flow method, which involved a number of significant assumptions, including timing of product 32 Table of Contents deployment, revenues, margin, and associated discount rates. Effective July 1, 2009, IPR&D associated with business combinations is recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and tested for impairment annually until it is put into service. Prior to July 1, 2009, all acquired IPR&D was expensed immediately. See note 10 to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements. The IPR&D associated with Medegen is related to certain products that are under development and are expected to be launched in the next two to three years. Completion of these products is subject to certain regulatory approvals and logistics surrounding manufacturing the end products cost effectively. The value of this IPR&D is reviewed for impairment annually or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value may not be recoverable. Product Quality and Recalls Product quality, particularly in life saving and sustaining technologies, plays a critical role in our success. A quality or safety issue may result in public warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals, import detentions of products made outside the United States, restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals. Any of the foregoing events could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, recalls may negatively affect sales due to customer concerns about product quality. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 the net charges related to product recalls was not material. For fiscal year 2010 and 2009, our results were negatively affected by net charges for the cost of product recalls of $3 million and $19 million, respectively. We are operating under an amended consent decree with the FDA, related to our infusion pump business in the United States. We entered into a consent decree with the FDA in February 2007 related to our Alaris SE pumps, and in February 2009, we and the FDA amended the consent decree (amended consent decree) to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for CareFusion 303, Inc., our subsidiary that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the United States. The amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories. While we remain subject to the amended consent decree, which includes the requirements of the consent decree, we have made substantial progress in our compliance efforts. In accordance with the consent decree, we reconditioned Alaris SE pumps that had been seized by the FDA, remediated Alaris SE pumps in use by customers, and had an independent expert inspect the Alaris SE pump facilities and provide a certification to the FDA as to compliance. As result of these efforts, in January 2010, we announced that the FDA had given us permission to resume the manufacturing and marketing of our Alaris SE pumps. In accordance with the amended consent decree, and in addition to the requirements of the original consent decree, we also implemented a corrective action plan to bring the Alaris System and all other infusion pumps in use in the United States market into compliance, had our infusion pump facilities inspected by an independent expert, and had our recall procedures and all ongoing recalls involving our infusion pumps inspected by an independent recall expert. In July 2010, the FDA notified us that we can proceed to the audit inspection phase of the amended consent decree, which includes the requirement to retain an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of our infusion pump facilities. The amended consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing, recall products and take other actions. We may be required to pay damages of $15,000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree, up to $15 million per year. We cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter, whether additional amounts will be incurred to resolve this matter, if any, or the matters ultimate impact on our business. We have no reserve in connection with the amended consent decree to cover any future costs and expenses of compliance with the amended consent decree. As such, we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because, among other things, the FDA may 33 Table of Contents determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree, and or we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree. In response to infusion product recalls and the amended consent decree, we have made substantial investments in quality systems and quality personnel headcount over the past several years. While we believe that we have made significant improvements to our product quality and overall quality systems, further quality concerns, whether real or perceived, could adversely affect our results. Conversely, improving quality can be a competitive advantage and improve our results. Infusion Business and Market Developments Our consolidated results have also been affected by developments within our infusion business and the infusion market in the United States. For several months of fiscal year 2009, we placed a hold on shipping the Alaris System while we sought FDA clearance for a software correction. We received the required clearance in July 2009, and we subsequently resumed shipments. This shipping hold resulted in a negative impact on our infusion revenues in fiscal year 2009. When we released the shiphold in July 2009, we saw higher demand, which resulted in higher revenues for fiscal year 2010. In fiscal year 2011, we saw additional growth in our infusion business, driven in part by our acquisition of Medegen, but also by developments in the infusion market in the United States. Because of safety concerns, the FDA has increased its scrutiny of infusion pumps. During fiscal year 2011, three of our competitors recalled their infusion pumps to correct safety concerns. In addition, a fourth was ordered by the FDA to recall and destroy as many as 200,000 of its infusion pumps currently in use and to provide refunds to its customers or replace pumps at no cost. As a result, there has been increased demand for infusion pumps in the United States in fiscal year 2011, as healthcare providers seek to replace or upgrade their existing equipment. We have seen increased demand for our infusion pumps as a result, which has contributed to higher infusion revenues for fiscal year 2011. Income Taxes Prior to the spinoff, our operations were included in Cardinal Healths United States federal and state tax returns or non United States jurisdictions tax returns. In connection with the spinoff, we and Cardinal Health entered into a tax matters agreement that governs the parties respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes. The tax matters agreement generally provides that the control of audit proceedings and payment of any additional liability related to our business is our responsibility. For the period July 1, 2009 through the spinoff date from Cardinal Health on August 31, 2009, our operations were included in the consolidated income tax returns of Cardinal Health, however, income taxes were calculated and provided for CareFusion on a separate return basis for fiscal years 2010 and 2009. The amount of liabilities related to income taxes prior to the spinoff that were retained by Cardinal Health are reflected in Parent Company Investment in the consolidated and combined statements of stockholders equity. Commencing with the period beginning September 1, 2009, we began to file stand alone income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction, various United States state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. Basis of Presentation The audited consolidated and combined financial statements reflect the consolidated operations of CareFusion Corporation and its subsidiaries as a separate, stand alone entity subsequent to August 31, 2009. Periods presented prior to our August 31, 2009 spinoff from Cardinal Health have been prepared on a stand alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Cardinal Health. Certain 34 Table of Contents lines of business that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the United States markets that were historically managed by us prior to the spinoff and were part of the clinical and medical products business of Cardinal Health, were retained by Cardinal Health as a result of the spinoff and are presented in these financial statements as discontinued operations. Our consolidated and combined financial statements do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods prior to the spinoff from Cardinal Health. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2010 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2011 2010 Change Revenue $ 3,528 $ 3,472 $ 56 Cost of Products Sold 1,723 1,740 (17 ) Gross Margin 1,805 1,732 73 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 1,103 1,121 (18 ) Research and Development Expenses 155 159 (4 ) Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 64 15 49 Gain on the Sale of Assets (13 ) (12 ) (1 ) Operating Income 496 449 47 Interest Expense and Other, Net 81 108 (27 ) Income Before Income Taxes 415 341 74 Provision for Income Taxes 124 183 (59 ) Income from Continuing Operations 291 158 133 Discontinued Operations Loss from the Disposal of Discontinued Businesses, Net of Tax (45 ) (8 ) (37 ) Income (Loss) from the Operations of Discontinued Businesses, Net of Tax (2 ) 44 (46 ) Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax (47 ) 36 (83 ) Net Income $ 244 $ 194 $ 50 Revenue Revenue in our Critical Care Technologies segment (CCT) increased 3% to $2,729 million compared to the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased largely as a result of increased sales for our infusion and dispensing businesses, which was partially offset by decreased revenue for our respiratory business. Infusion revenues increased as a result of core business growth in both capital and disposable products and the year over year impact of our acquisition of Medegen in May 2010. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues as a result of the benefit during fiscal 2010 from the release of the shipping hold on the Alaris System in July 2009. Also affecting the year over year revenue change was the downward adjustment to revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 associated with a revised estimate of accrued rebates to distributors. Dispensing revenues increased primarily as a result of new business and competitive displacements. 35 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2010, respiratory product revenues were strong due to increased demand resulting from emergency preparedness efforts, including preparations for an anticipated severe flu season. As a result of restrained customer spending, a light flu season, and lower hospital admissions, we experienced lower capital product revenues and decreased utilization of our disposable respiratory products. Revenue in our Medical Technologies and Services segment (MT&S) decreased by 4% to $799 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue decrease is primarily attributable to the impact of divesting our Onsite Services and Research Services businesses. These decreases were partially offset by growth in our infection prevention and medical specialties businesses. Gross Margin and Cost of Products Sold Gross margin increased 4%, to $1,805 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin was 51.2% and 49.9% for fiscal year 2011 and 2010, respectively. The overall increase in gross margin was primarily the result of higher sales associated with our infusion and dispensing businesses. Margin as a percentage of revenue increased as a result of favorable changes in product sales mix, with higher sales in our infusion and dispensing businesses, which generally have higher margins; and lower sales in our respiratory products business, which generally has lower margins. Also improving our gross margin percentage were the impacts of our 2011 Plan and favorable manufacturing cost reductions. Manufacturing savings resulted from: (a) cost benefits recognized through strategic sourcing of raw materials; (b) manufacturing efficiencies associated with lean transformation; and (c) reduced overhead spending. Selling, General and Administrative and Research and Development Expenses SG&A and Research and Development expenses decreased 2% to $1,258 million during fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily a result of savings associated with the 2011 Plan and reduced operating expenses associated with the divestiture of our Research Services business in May 2010. These decreases were partially offset by increased expenses associated with our acquisition of Medegen in May 2010 and increasing investment in our selling organization. Included within our SG&A expenses are certain one time costs associated with our spinoff from Cardinal Health of $50 million and $59 million for fiscal year 2011 and 2010, respectively. Expenditures associated with standing up operations from the spinoff were substantially complete as of the end of fiscal year 2011. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges Restructuring and acquisition integration charges increased $49 million to $64 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily a result of charges associated with the 2011 Plan. We incurred charges of approximately $46 million during fiscal year 2011 associated with the 2011 Plan. In addition to the 2011 Plan, we periodically incur costs to implement smaller restructuring efforts for specific operations. These restructuring plans focus on various aspects of operations, including closing and consolidating certain manufacturing operations, rationalizing headcount and aligning operations in the most strategic and cost efficient structure. Gain on the Sale of Assets In March of fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of our Onsite Services business, which was historically part of our MT&S segment. The pre tax gain related to the disposition was approximately $15 million, which was partially offset by an adjustment to the gain on sale related to the fiscal 2010 sale of our Research Services business. See note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Operating Income Segment profit in our CCT reportable segment increased 10% to $434 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit was primarily driven by higher revenue in our infusion and dispensing businesses and reductions in overhead spending. Partially offsetting this increase were lower revenues from our respiratory businesses and the impact of increases in restructuring charges of $29 million. Segment profit in our MT&S reportable segment increased 17% to $49 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit is primarily attributable to the impact of an increase in revenue associated with our infection prevention and medical specialties businesses. Partially offsetting this increase was the impact of increases in restructuring charges of $21 million. Interest Expense and Other Interest expense and other, net decreased 25% to $81 million compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was primarily related to a one time write off of debt issuance and related costs of $22 million associated with the bridge loan facility, which was terminated on August 31, 2009 and recorded during fiscal year 2010, as well as foreign currency gains and lower net interest expense in fiscal year 2011. In general, gains and losses resulting from foreign currency exchange rates are related to the remeasurement of receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary which holds the receivable or payable and are netted with any associated fair value hedging activities entered into to minimize this exposure. See note 15 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense decreased 32% to $124 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 was 30.0% compared to 53.7% for fiscal year 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in discrete tax expense in fiscal year 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal year 2010, we completed a detailed analysis of our tax reserves prompted by new information related to our potential tax positions, tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. For this analysis, we retained third party advisors to assist in assessing whether, based on the new information, our tax risks had changed, and whether additional reserves in excess of those already recorded were necessary. Based on this analysis, we increased our existing reserves and recorded a change in estimate of approximately $58 million as a charge to net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. Also during fiscal year 2010, the disposition of our Research Services business resulted in additional tax expense, primarily due to the write off of non deductible goodwill associated with the disposition. We are currently under IRS audit for fiscal years 2003 through 2007, and we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 and for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. We continue to engage in substantive discussions with the IRS Appeals office related to our 2003 through 2005 fiscal years. It is reasonably possible that we will reach a favorable settlement with the IRS in relation to the fiscal years 2003 through 2005 within the next twelve months. We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for the matters under appeal with the IRS. However, if upon the conclusion of these audits, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount that is materially different than our current reserves, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate may be materially impacted in the period of adjustment. Generally, fluctuations in our effective tax rate are primarily due to changes within international and state effective tax rates resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of restructuring and acquisition integration charges and other discrete items, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item. The provision for income tax amounts calculated for periods prior to August 31, 2009 is not likely to be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for such periods. 37 Table of Contents For additional detail regarding the provision for income taxes, see note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax totaled $47 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to income from discontinued operations of $36 million for fiscal year 2010. The decrease is a result of a loss from the disposal of the International Surgical Products business, which we divested in fiscal year 2011. Additionally, included in discontinued operations in the prior year are (a) two months of results from certain lines of business that manufactured and sold surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the U.S. markets that were historically managed by us prior to the spinoff and were part of the clinical and medical products business of Cardinal Health, and were retained by Cardinal Health as a result of the spinoff, (b) results from the companys former Audiology business, which produced and marketed hearing diagnostic equipment, which was sold on October 1, 2009 and (c) results from the International Surgical Products business, which was sold on April 1, 2011. See note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information related to these discontinued operations. Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2009 Below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2010 and 2009: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2010 2009 Change Revenue $ 3,472 $ 3,175 $ 297 Cost of Products Sold 1,740 1,569 171 Gross Margin 1,732 1,606 126 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 1,121 944 177 Research and Development Expenses 159 160 (1 ) Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges 15 69 (54 ) Gain on the Sale of Assets (12 ) (12 ) Operating Income 449 433 16 Interest Expense and Other, Net 108 95 13 Income Before Income Tax 341 338 3 Provision for Income Tax 183 51 132 Income from Continuing Operations 158 287 (129 ) Discontinued Operations: Loss from the Disposal of Discontinued Businesses, Net of Tax (8 ) (8 ) Income from the Operations of Discontinued Businesses, Net of Tax 44 281 (237 ) Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax 36 281 (245 ) Net Income $ 194 $ 568 $ (374 ) Revenue Revenue in our CCT segment increased by $215 million, or 9%, to $2,644 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue was attributable to increased sales in our respiratory products, primarily ventilators and disposables, as a result of emergency preparedness during fiscal year 2010, including the potential effects of influenza viruses. In addition, revenues increased as a result of the impact of commercial 38 Table of Contents agreements executed in conjunction with our separation from Cardinal Health. Our infusion product revenues increased largely as a result of the net impact of the release of the shipping hold on the Alaris System that began in February 2009 and ended in July 2009 and the fulfillment of previously delayed customer orders that resulted from the shipping hold. However, infusion revenues were negatively impacted by delays in hospital capital spending, primarily for the first six months of fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009. Dispensing equipment revenues declined due to the impact of delays in hospital capital spending through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2010, as well as the way in which hospitals prioritize and allocate their spending. Revenue in our MT&S segment increased by $82 million, or 11%, to $828 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue increase is attributable to growth in our interventional specialties products business, and growth in our infection prevention products business. Interventional specialties growth primarily resulted from increased sales of chronic drainage products. Gross Margin and Cost of Products Sold Gross margin increased $126 million, or 8%, to $1,732 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin was 49.9% and 50.6% of revenue for fiscal year 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to sales growth, combined with the favorable impacts in manufacturing costs. Manufacturing savings resulting from: (a) improved utilization of raw materials; (b) the impact of relocating certain of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers to lower cost jurisdictions; (c) favorable overhead absorption as a result of increased volume; and (d) controlled overhead spending. Also affecting the increase were infusion product recall charges for $18 million that impacted the quarter ended March 31, 2009 associated with the Alaris System shipping hold. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased year over year. This was the result of the manufacturing efficiencies noted above, offset by a product mix that includes a higher proportion of respiratory sales, which generally have lower margins than our other capital equipment businesses. Selling, General and Administrative and Research and Development Expenses SG&A and Research and Development expenses increased $176 million, or 16%, to $1,280 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in SG&A is attributable to incremental operating costs related to standing up certain corporate functions; one time costs associated with our spinoff from Cardinal Health of $59 million; and increases in discretionary variable compensation and share based compensation of $82 million. Partially offsetting these increases are the favorable impacts of our March 2009 global workforce reduction program of $47 million. SG&A expenses for fiscal year 2009 include allocated costs to us by Cardinal Health of $406 million. Included within the $406 million is $21 million of expenses associated with discontinued operations. Allocated SG&A expenses include expenses for shared functions, including management, finance, financial shared services, human resources, information technology, legal, legislative affairs and management incentive plan expenses. SG&A expenses historically allocated to us for periods prior to August 31, 2009 are not likely to be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for such periods. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges Restructuring and acquisition integration charges decreased $54 million, or 78%, to $15 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal year 2009, we launched a series of restructuring programs with the goal to provide improved management focus through the re alignment of the management structure and 39 Table of Contents lowering its cost structure through a reduction in global workforce. During fiscal year 2010, we recorded $5 million of expense associated with these restructuring programs. In total, we recorded $61 million of expense for these restructuring programs, and as of March 31, 2010, all major activities of these programs have been completed. During fiscal year 2009, restructuring charges were primarily comprised of employee related and facility exit restructuring charges of $57 million, and acquisition integration expenses of $12 million were primarily related to our 2007 acquisition of Viasys. Gain on the Sale of Assets In May 2010, we completed the sale of our Research Services business, which was historically part of our MT&S segment, for $81 million in cash. Including estimated working capital adjustments as part of the definitive agreement, the pre tax gain related to the disposition was approximately $12 million, or $1 million loss after tax. Income tax expense associated with the transaction was impacted by approximately $24 million of goodwill assigned to the disposition that was not deductible for tax purposes. Operating Income Operating income for fiscal year 2010 increased $16 million, or 4%, to $449 million. The increase in operating income was due to a reduction of restructuring and acquisition integration charges, the pre tax gain on the sale of our Research Services business, and higher sales and associated margin. Partially offsetting these increases are higher SG&A expenses, primarily associated with one time and incremental expenses related to standing up as a public company. Segment profit in our CCT reportable segment increased by $41 million, or 12%, to $395 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in segment profit is attributable to higher sales in our infusion and respiratory businesses, decreases in restructuring and integration charges, and a decrease in infusion product recall charges relative to the $18 million product recall charge recorded for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. Segment profit in our MT&S reportable segment decreased by $37 million, or 47%, to $42 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in segment profit is primarily attributable to the timing and increase of SG&A expenses. The decreases were partially offset by incremental gross margin and reductions in restructuring and acquisition integration expenses. Interest Expense and Other Interest expense and other, net for fiscal year 2010 increased $13 million, or 14%, to $108 million. The increase is attributable to a one time write off of debt issuance and related costs of $22 million associated with the bridge loan facility, which was terminated on August 31, 2009, and to a lesser extent, the difference in interest expense for our outstanding senior notes compared to interest expense associated with the allocated debt from Cardinal Health in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in foreign currency exchange losses of $23 million during fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009. In general, gains and losses resulting from foreign currency exchange rates are related to the remeasurement of receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary that holds the receivable or payable. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense for fiscal year 2010 increased $132 million to $183 million compared to the prior fiscal year. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2010 was 53.7% compared to 15.1% for fiscal year 2009. The change in expense and effective tax rates in aggregate were primarily the result of charges recorded during fiscal year 2010, as compared to benefits recorded during fiscal year 2009. 40 Table of Contents During fiscal year 2010, we increased our existing tax reserves by approximately $58 million, which was recorded as a charge to net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. Also during fiscal year 2010, the disposition of our Research Services business resulted in additional tax expense primarily due to the write off of non deductible goodwill associated with the disposition. During fiscal year 2009, a claim was filed by Cardinal Health with the IRS to amend the filing position taken on its United States federal income tax return for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 related to a secured loan transaction involving certain of our sales type lease receivables. Since our income taxes are presented on a separate return basis, we recognized a net tax benefit in the quarter ended March 31, 2009, related to this item. Also during fiscal year 2009, a benefit was recorded due to the impact of changes in state tax laws and a change in the estimated values of our deferred income tax liabilities due to the separation from Cardinal Health. For additional detail regarding the provision for income taxes, see note 13 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for fiscal year 2010 decreased 87% to $36 million compared to the prior fiscal year. Included in discontinued operations for fiscal year 2010 and 2009 are (a) certain lines of business that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves, drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the United States markets that were historically managed by us prior to the spinoff and were part of the clinical and medical products business of Cardinal Health, and were retained by Cardinal Health as a result of the spinoff, (b) the Audiology business, which produces and markets hearing diagnostic equipment, which was sold on October 1, 2009; and (c) the International Surgical Products business, which was sold on April 1, 2011. The net income earned by the businesses retained by Cardinal Health upon the spinoff is included within our income from discontinued operations until the date of our spinoff of August 31, 2009, or two months in fiscal year 2010; whereas the net income earned by these businesses for the entire fiscal year 2009 is included within our income from discontinued operations for that same period. The significant decrease in our income from discontinued operations is primarily due to the difference in the number of periods the businesses retained by Cardinal Health were included within our results in fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009. Additionally, during fiscal year 2010, we recorded losses associated with the sale of the Audiology business. See note 2 to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Historically, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, positive cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations primarily represents inflows from net income (adjusted for depreciation and other non cash items) and outflows from investment in sales type leases entered into, as we sell and install dispensing equipment, and other increases in working capital needed to grow the business. Cash flows from investing activities represent our investment in intellectual property and capital equipment required to grow our business, as well as acquisitions. In fiscal year 2011, cash flows from financing activities are primarily related to changes in investments in discontinued operations. Prior to our spinoff, Cardinal Health would fund our operating and investing activities as needed and transfer our excess cash at its discretion. Our cash balance at June 30, 2011 was $1,371 million. Of this balance, $1,130 million is held outside of the United States and is denominated in United States dollars as well as other currencies. We believe that our current domestic cash flow from operations and domestic cash balances are sufficient to meet domestic operating needs. It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in order to ensure sufficient working capital and expand existing operations outside the United States. Additionally, we intend to fund foreign acquisitions primarily through the use of unrepatriated cash held by foreign subsidiaries. However, should our domestic cash needs exceed our current or future domestic cash flows, we could repatriate foreign cash or utilize our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, both of which would result in increased expense. 41 Table of Contents We believe that our future cash from operations together with our access to funds available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions and new business development activities. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table summarizes our consolidated and combined statements of cash flows from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009: Fiscal Year Ended June 30, (in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash Flow Provided by/(Used in) Operating Activities $ 335 $ 659 $ 528 Investing Activities $ (18 ) $ (254 ) $ (130 ) Financing Activities $ 32 $ (12 ) $ (207 ) Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010 Net operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased $324 million to $335 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the prior year. The decrease is due to the impact of cash outflows associated with other accrued liabilities and operating items ($394 million) primarily attributable to changes in income taxes payable, increases in uncertain tax position reserves, and employee incentive compensation that was accrued at June 30, 2010 and paid during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. At June 30, 2011, accrued employee incentive compensation balances are significantly lower than similar accruals at June 30, 2010. Additionally, there was a decrease in cash flow associated with accounts receivable as a result of temporary delays in collections as a result of new system implementations ($146 million) and a decrease in cash flow associated with inventory ($106 million). These decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by increases in income from continuing operations ($133 million) and the impact of non cash items ($174 million), primarily attributable to changes in deferred income taxes. Net cash used in continuing operations from investing activities decreased $236 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the prior year primarily due to a reduction in amounts paid for acquisitions and an increase in amounts received for divestitures. During the year ended June 30, 2011 we purchased Vestara and divested our OnSite and International Surgical Products businesses. Net cash provided by continuing operations from financing activities increased $44 million for the year ended June 30, 2011 compared to the prior year. During the year ended June 30, 2010, we received proceeds from the issuance of debt ($1,378 million) and utilized these proceeds to pay a dividend to Cardinal Health ($1,374 million) associated with our spinoff. The remaining year over year change was primarily due to the change in amounts transferred to us from Cardinal Health before our spinoff ($46 million), partially offset by transfers with our International Surgical Products business ($65 million), and our payments of debt issuance costs ($29 million) during the year ended June 30, 2010. Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $131 million to $659 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was due to increased cash flows associated with other accrued liabilities and operating items ($256 million), primarily related to an increase in uncertain tax position reserves, the timing of recognition of certain deferred tax items through our current tax provision and taxes payable, and accruals for employee related liabilities; increases in cash flows associated with accounts payable ($32 million), primarily due to longer payment cycles at the end of fiscal year 2010 compared 42 Table of Contents to fiscal year 2009 to enhance our cash positions; and the impacts of converting inventory balances ($51 million), primarily related to the release of the shipping hold on the Alaris System. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in cash flows associated with accounts receivable ($63 million). The decrease in cash flow associated with accounts receivable is primarily a result of longer collection periods with Cardinal Health. Prior to the spinoff, accounts receivables from Cardinal Health were considered to be settled for cash immediately, as they were intercompany balances. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations increased $124 million to $254 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to the purchase of Medegen ($224 million) and increases in capital expenditures ($13 million). The increase was partially offset by proceeds from the divestitures of our Research Services business ($81 million) and Audiology business ($27 million). Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations decreased $195 million to $12 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, compared to the prior fiscal year. Within financing activities, we incurred indebtedness with a face value of $1.4 billion in connection with the spinoff from Cardinal Health. On August 31, 2009, we used the proceeds of this debt of $1.374 billion to pay a dividend to Cardinal Health, and as a result, those proceeds were not available for our business needs. Financing activities prior to fiscal year 2010 were primarily related to cash receipts and disbursements between us and Cardinal Health to fund business operations as a component of Cardinal Health. Capital Resources Senior Unsecured Notes. On July 14, 2009, we offered and sold $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and received net proceeds of $1.374 billion. As part of the spinoff, the net proceeds were subsequently distributed as a dividend payment to Cardinal Health. The indenture for the senior notes limits our ability to incur certain secured debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. In accordance with the indenture, we may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a price that would equal or exceed the outstanding principal balance, as defined. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and experience a below investment grade rating event, we may be required to repurchase all of the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal balance plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC to conduct an exchange offer for the notes. In accordance with the registration rights agreement, we filed a Form S 4 with the SEC and conducted an exchange offer for the notes, which we completed on February 4, 2010. The purpose of the exchange offer was to allow the holders of the senior notes, which were issued in a private placement transaction and were subject to transfer restrictions, to exchange their notes for new notes that did not have these restrictions and are registered under the Securities Act. All of the outstanding senior notes were exchanged in the exchange offer. Following the exchange offer, we continue to have $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding. Revolving Credit Facilities. During fiscal year 2011, we maintained two senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, as follows: $240 million 364 day revolving credit facility (which expired on August 30, 2010); and $480 million three year revolving credit facility (maturing August 31, 2012) At June 30, 2011, we had no amounts outstanding under our three year revolving credit facility. On July 6, 2011, we entered into a new five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility and terminated the existing three year facility. The new five year credit facility has an aggregate available principal amount of $550 43 Table of Contents million, and matures on July 6, 2016. At our request and subject to certain conditions, the commitments under the facility may be increased by up to $200 million to the extent that existing or new lenders agree to provide such additional commitments. Borrowings under the five year credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum based upon the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate or the alternate base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin, which varies based upon CareFusions debt ratings. The five year credit facility also requires us to pay a quarterly commitment fee to the lenders under the credit facility on the amount of the lenders unused commitments thereunder based upon CareFusions debt ratings. The five year credit facility contains several customary covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on liens, subsidiary indebtedness, dispositions, and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 3.50:1.00 as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters, and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 3.50:1.00 as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters. The credit facility is subject to customary events of default, including, but not limited to, non payment of principal or other amounts when due, breach of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross default to other material indebtedness, certain ERISA related events, certain voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy events, and change of control. Bridge Loan Facility. On July 1, 2009, we entered into a senior unsecured bridge loan facility (the bridge loan facility) to provide financing for an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, with a term of 364 days from the date of any funding, for payment of the dividend to Cardinal Health as part of our spinoff. As the senior unsecured note offering was successfully completed prior to the separation, those proceeds were used to finance the payment of the dividend to Cardinal Health in lieu of drawing on the bridge loan facility. As a result, the bridge loan facility was terminated on August 31, 2009. In connection with this termination, we expensed approximately $22 million of capitalized fees to interest expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2009. Dividends We currently intend to retain any earnings to finance research and development, acquisitions and the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The declaration and payment of any dividends in the future by us will be subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Moreover, should we pay any dividend in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends. Contractual Obligations As of June 30, 2011, our contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by fiscal year, are as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year (in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Long Term Debt1 $ $ 250 $ 450 $ 700 $ 1,400 Capital Lease Obligations2 1 1 2 Other Long Term Liabilities3 68 33 10 5 116 Interest on Long Term Debt4 78 137 93 142 450 Operating Leases5 38 62 39 20 159 Purchase Obligations6 255 18 2 1 276 Total Financial Obligations $ 440 $ 501 $ 594 $ 868 $ 2,403 44 Table of Contents 1 Represents maturities of our long term debt obligations, excluding capital lease obligations described below, as described in note 12 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. Amounts are presented gross of debt issuance discounts of $14 million at June 30, 2011. 2 Represents maturities of our capital lease obligations included within long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet and the related estimated future interest payments. 3 Represents cash outflows by period for certain of our long term liabilities in which cash outflows could be reasonably estimated. Certain long term liabilities, such as unrecognized tax benefits of $289 million and deferred taxes of $644 million, tax associated accruals of $109 million, deferred compensation obligations of $15 million and other long term liabilities of $17 million, have been excluded from the table above because of the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflow. See note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information. 4 Interest obligation is calculated based on each outstanding debt stated or coupon rate, or existing variable rate as of June 30, 2011, as applicable. 5 Represents minimum rental payments and the related estimated future interest payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms as described in note 14 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. 6 Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including the following: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. In addition, contracts that can be unilaterally cancelled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period. In addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, we expect that we will make payments to the IRS related to ongoing appeals of prior tax years under audit. During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, we began substantive discussions with the IRS Appeals office related to our 2003 through 2005 fiscal tax years, which were previously under audit. We believe that we have provided adequate reserves for the matters under appeal with the IRS. However, if upon the conclusion of these audits, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount that is materially different than our current reserves, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate may be materially impacted in the period of adjustment. Further, even if we are adequately reserved for these matters, final settlement would require us to make a cash payment to the IRS, which could be material. If we determine to repatriate foreign cash or utilize our revolving credit facility to fund the payment to the IRS, it may result in increased costs. See note 13 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information. In July 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Rowa, a Germany based company specializing in robotic medication storage and retrieval systems for retail and hospital pharmacies, for approximately $150 million. We completed this acquisition on August 1, 2011, which we funded with existing cash and funds generated from operations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At June 30, 2011, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our audited consolidated and combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The preparation of these audited consolidated and 45 Table of Contents combined financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant effect on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience, trends, and managements judgment. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and believe our estimates to be reasonable. Other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our audited consolidated and combined financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For additional accounting policies, see note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements. Revenue Recognition We generate revenue through the sale and lease of equipment, software, services, medical products, supplies, and the income associated with the financing of our equipment leases. We recognize revenue when: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; product delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends on a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized may involve subjective or complex judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. The significant judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and could result in material differences under other assumptions and conditions are those described below. Evaluation of the Significance of Embedded Software We sell and lease products with embedded software. We regularly review these products to determine whether embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole. If the embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole, the product is classified as a software product unless it is determined that the tangible elements and software elements of the product work together to deliver the essential functionality of the product as a whole. We consider the following characteristics to be indicators that embedded software is more than incidental to the product as whole: software is a significant focus of the marketing effort or the software application is sold separately; significant internally developed software costs have been incurred; and if we provide telephone support, bug fixes, and or unspecified upgrades specific to the embedded software. The evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment as the products exhibit varying degrees of the indicators identified above, such as: certain products are marketed as systems or solutions wherein it is implied, but not explicitly stated within marketing and sales collateral, that embedded software provides the basis for significant functionalities identified within the marketing efforts; internal software development costs are incurred during the product development process; 46 Table of Contents separately priced extended warranty services provide post installation support relative to repair parts and services and also include telephone support and bug fixes for the software embedded within the products; and we are required by law to provide medical safety related bug fixes for products with embedded software elements. In evaluating whether the tangible elements and software elements of the product together deliver the essential functionality of the product as a whole, we consider the following factors: the frequency in which tangible elements are sold separately from the software elements; and whether the non software elements substantively contribute to the essential functionality of the product. Although we believe the software embedded within our infusion products, when sold with safety software, patient identification products, and certain diagnostic equipment is more than incidental to the product as a whole, the tangible elements and software elements work together to deliver the essential functionality of these products as a whole and therefore these products are not classified as software. We have determined the embedded software within our other products, primarily our dispensing and respiratory products, is incidental to the products as a whole. Those products are therefore not classified as software. Generally, we classify our stand alone software application sales and any related post contract support related to these sales as software. Revenue Recognition for Leases Our accounting for leases involves specific determinations under applicable lease accounting standards, which often involve complex and prescriptive provisions. If a lease qualifies as a sales type capital lease, equipment revenue is recognized upon delivery or installation of the equipment as opposed to ratably over the lease term. Therefore, our lease classification procedures significantly affect the timing of revenue recognition. The critical element we consider in determining the classification of our lease transactions is the fair value of the leased equipment, including its estimated fair value at the inception and conclusion of the lease, and the estimated useful life of our equipment. For the purposes of determining the fair value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease, we apply the following discounts against the purchase list price: (a) the percentage discount from list prices provided regardless of a customers intent to lease or purchase and (b) an incremental discount provided exclusively to lease customers. This methodology assumes that purchase customers are provided similar discounts in (a) above as lease customers. Periodically, we review discount levels provided to purchase customers and lease customers to validate this assumption. We estimate the useful life of our equipment based upon actual historical data which identifies the length of time our equipment has been in place and in service at customer facilities. Multiple Element Arrangements The majority of our transactions qualify as multiple element arrangements. We use the relative selling price method to allocate contract proceeds to non software products, which are then individually recognized to revenue. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available, or managements estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is available. The determination of vendor specific objective evidence estimates associated with our products and services is generally based on historical evidence of sales of the same product in stand alone transactions and the contract renewal prices for post contract support and separately priced extended warranty services. The determination of third party evidence is generally based on market data on sales of similar products and services, if available; 47 Table of Contents however in most cases we and our competitors execute large multiple element arrangements which reduces our ability to determine the prices for individual products and services. Managements best estimate of selling price is developed consistent with the price at which we would transact if the deliverable were sold by the vendor regularly on a stand alone basis. In determining estimated selling price, we generally consider the following: stand alone sales prices, established price lists, costs to produce, profit margins for similar products, market conditions, and customer stratification. For software and software related products, we use the relative fair value method to allocate contract proceeds to each unit of accounting; whereby the evidence used in the determination of fair value estimates are based solely on vendor specific objective evidence. To the extent that fair value evidence does not exist for delivered elements of the transaction, we apply the residual method. Different conclusions as to the existence and valuation of selling price estimates may significantly affect the timing and valuation of revenue recognition, the classification of leasing transactions, and the classification of revenue as product, service, rental or other income. It is impossible to determine the effects of potential different conclusions as they relate to the existence or valuation of selling price estimates. Business Combinations Assumptions and estimates are used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. A significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets, which requires management to use significant judgment in determining fair value. Current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is affected by purchase price allocations and by the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles, excluding goodwill. We believe the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. In conjunction with the review of a transaction, the status of the acquired companys research and development projects is assessed to determine the existence of IPR&D. In connection with certain acquisitions, we are required to estimate the fair value of acquired IPR&D, which requires selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project. Management also assesses the current status of development, nature and timing of efforts to complete such development, uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value. Costs are not assigned to IPR&D unless future development is probable. Beginning with acquisitions completed on or after July 1, 2009, IPR&D is recorded as an unamortized intangible asset until the underlying products are either completed and put into service, which would require commencing amortization over the estimated product life, or determining the products will not complete development, which would require impairing the portion of IPR&D associated with that product. Until either determination is made, IPR&D is subject to periodic impairment review, with impairments, if any, expensed to our consolidated and combined statement of income. During fiscal year 2010, we completed the acquisition of Medegen, which resulted in approximately $45 million of IPR&D associated with new products under development being recorded as an intangible asset. The timing and recognition of both the in service date for these products as well as the potential of impairment involves significant judgment. Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews annually, and whenever indicators of impairment exist. Intangibles with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable. In conducting the annual impairment test of our goodwill, the fair value of our reporting units is compared to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, then no impairment exists. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, further analysis is performed to assess impairment. We perform our impairment testing at the operating segment level. There are no fluid active or inactive markets for our operating 48 Table of Contents segments to derive approximate fair values, and accordingly, the valuation process is similar to the valuation of a closely held company and considers valuation methods that are income based and market based. Our income based approach is a discounted cash flow method which utilizes an estimated discount rate to the projected after tax cash flows for the operating segment. Our market based approach utilizes an estimated market based multiple to the operating segments estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The results of the income based and market based approaches are equally weighted to arrive at the total estimated fair value for each operating segment. Based on our annual impairment test as of April 1, 2011, we did not record any goodwill impairments. The application of valuation methods requires significant judgment regarding appropriate inputs and assumptions and results in our best estimate of the fair value of an operating segment. As with any estimate, inputs and assumptions can be subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. Informed market participants can differ in their perception of value for a reporting unit. It is possible that one of our operating segments could experience goodwill impairment in the future. Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Charges We separately identify restructuring and acquisition integration charges in SG&A expenses. A restructuring activity is a program whereby we fundamentally change our operations such as closing facilities, moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product. Restructuring activities may also involve substantial re alignment of the management structure of a business unit in response to changing market conditions. Acquisition integration charges are activities and costs to integrate acquired companies into the operations of our existing activities, including such functions as selling, manufacturing, information systems, and corporate related functions. The majority of the charges related to restructuring and acquisition integration can be classified in one of the following categories: employee related costs, exit costs (including lease termination costs), asset impairments, and other integration costs. Employee related costs include severance and termination benefits. Lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees, forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income. Other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility. Asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of our assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities. See note 5 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information. Provision for Income Taxes Prior to August 31, 2009, our income taxes as presented are calculated on a separate tax return basis, although our operations were historically included in Cardinal Healths United States federal and state tax returns or non United States jurisdictions tax returns. Cardinal Healths global tax model was developed based on its entire portfolio of businesses. Accordingly, our tax results for periods prior to August 31, 2009 are not necessarily reflective of the results that we would have generated on a stand alone basis. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and measurement of uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated and combined financial statements. The proper treatment of various tax issues, including transfer pricing, are subjective determinations that depend on the specific facts and circumstances at issue. To estimate contingent tax reserves, management first concludes whether our positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The reserve is then determined by evaluating and weighing the technical 49 Table of Contents merits of alternative methodologies against each other and concluding on the positions that provide the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate resolution. To the extent there are any administrative or case law developments that provide additional evidence in favor or against the valuation methodologies utilized, the contingent tax reserve will be adjusted in the period that such developments occur. Loss Contingencies We accrue for contingencies related to litigation and other claims arising out of our business based on degree of probability and range of possible loss. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the consolidated and combined financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these claims are often inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. Share Based Compensation We maintain a stock incentive plan that provides for awards of non qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock units for the benefit of certain of our officers, directors and employees. At the time of the spinoff, Cardinal Health converted or adjusted outstanding stock options, restricted shares and restricted share units (collectively, share based awards) with respect to Cardinal Health common shares held by Cardinal Health and CareFusion employees. The manner of conversion for each employee was determined based on the date of the original share based award and the employment status of the employee at the spinoff date of August 31, 2009. We record share based compensation expense for the share based awards held by our employees, regardless of whether such share based awards are based on common stock of CareFusion or common shares of Cardinal Health, with the offsetting impact recorded to Additional Paid In Capital in our consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the stock options granted during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, was estimated by Cardinal Health utilizing a Lattice valuation model. The fair value of stock options granted by CareFusion during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, and subsequent to the spinoff, was estimated by CareFusion utilizing a Black Scholes Merton valuation model. The fair value of performance stock units granted by CareFusion during fiscal year 2011 was estimated by CareFusion utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model. Our estimate of fair value depends on a complex process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events. These events, estimates of which are entered within the valuation model include, but are not limited to, stock price volatility, the expected life, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rates. Once fair values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results. We are required to compare our estimated share based forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary. See note 20 to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information regarding share based compensation including the valuation process. New Accounting Pronouncements See note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We seek to manage these risks using hedging strategies that involve the use of derivative instruments. We do not enter into any derivative agreements for trading or speculative purposes. While we believe we have designed an effective risk management program, there are inherent limitations in our ability to forecast our exposures, and therefore, we cannot guarantee that our programs will completely mitigate all risks associated with unfavorable movement in either foreign exchange rates or interest rates. Additionally, the timing of the recognition of gains and losses related to derivative instruments can be different from the recognition of the underlying economic exposure. This may impact our consolidated operating results and financial position. Interest Rate Risk Interest income and expense on variable rate instruments are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates across the world. Changes in interest rates primarily affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents and to a significantly lesser extent the interest expense on our debt. As of June 30, 2011, the majority of our outstanding debt balances is fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on this debt, interest on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations as the rate on this facility is variable. At June 30, 2011 we had no amount outstanding under our $480 million three year revolving credit facility. We terminated our three year revolving credit facility and replaced it with a five year revolving credit facility in July 2011.

The fair value of our senior notes at June 30, 2011 and 2010 was based on quoted market prices. The fair value of the other obligations at June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010, was based on either the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt and the current interest rates offered for debt or estimated based on discounted cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk We are a global company with operations in multiple countries and are a net recipient of currencies other than the United States dollar (USD). Accordingly, a strengthening of the USD will negatively impact revenues and gross margins expressed in consolidated USD terms. Currently, we have foreign exchange risk associated with currency exposure associated with existing assets and liabilities, committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. We seek to manage our foreign exchange risk by using derivative contracts such as forwards, swaps and options with financial institutions to hedge our risks. In general, we will hedge material foreign exchange exposures up to twelve months in advance; however, we may choose not to hedge some exposures for a variety of reasons including prohibitive economic costs. The realized and unrealized gains and losses of foreign currency forward contracts and the re measurement of foreign denominated receivables, payables and loans are recorded in the consolidated statement of income. To the extent that cash flow hedges qualify for hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the forward contract will be recorded to OCI. As the forecasted exposures affect earnings, the realized gain or loss on the forward contract will be moved from OCI to the consolidated and combined statements of income. 52 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding as of June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010: June 30, 2011 June 30, 2010 (in millions) NotionalAmount AverageContractRate NotionalAmount AverageContractRate Foreign Currency Forward Contracts: (Receive USD/pay foreign currency) Euro $ 153 1.4 $ 12 1.4 Australian Dollar 36 1.0 19 0.9 New Zealand Dollar 9 0.8 9 0.7 South African Rand 2 7.2 2 7.7 Norwegian Krone 2 5.9 Swedish Krona 2 7.1 Mexico Peso 7 12.0 2 13.0 Canadian Dollar 1 1.0 5 1.0 Japanese Yen 1 89.3 Swiss Franc 3 0.9 British Pound 47 1.6 Total $ 258 $ 54 Estimated Fair Value $ $ 1 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts: (Pay USD/receive foreign currency) Mexican Peso $ 33 12.0 $ 10 13.0 Swiss Franc 14 0.9 5 1.1 British Pound 1 1.6 19 1.5 Canadian Dollar 1 1.0 Euro 8 1.4 Total $ 48 $ 43 Estimated Fair Value $ 1 $ Foreign Currency Forward Contracts: (Pay foreign currency/receive euros) British Pound $ 7 0.9 $ 2 0.8 Swiss Franc 18 1.4 Total $ 7 $ 20 Estimated Fair Value $ $ Commodity Price Risk Management We purchase commodities such as resins, printed circuit boards, latex, various fuel products and polystyrene, among others for use in our manufacturing processes. We typically purchase these commodities at market prices, and as a result are affected by market price fluctuations. We have decided not to hedge these exposures as they are deemed immaterial. 53 Table of Contents
