ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following table sets forth certain information regarding the production volumes, oil and gas sales, average sales prices received and expenses for the periods indicated: YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 2000 2001 NET PRODUCTION: Oil (mbbl) ............................. 4,147 3,068 2,880 Gas (mmcf) ............................. 108,610 115,771 144,171 Gas equivalent (mmcfe) ................. 133,492 134,179 161,451 OIL AND GAS SALES ($ IN THOUSANDS): Oil .................................... $ 66,413 $ 80,953 $ 77,522 Gas .................................... 214,032 389,217 658,007 Total oil and gas sales .......... $280,445 $470,170 $735,529 AVERAGE SALES PRICE: Oil ($ per bbl) ........................ $ 16.01 $ 26.39 $ 26.92 Gas ($ per mcf) ........................ $ 1.97 $ 3.36 $ 4.56 Gas equivalent ($ per mcfe) ............ $ 2.10 $ 3.50 $ 4.56 EXPENSES ($ PER mcfe): Production expenses and taxes .......... $ 0.45 $ 0.56 $ 0.67 General and administrative ............. $ 0.10 $ 0.10 $ 0.09 Depreciation, depletion and amortization........................... $ 0.71 $ 0.75 $ 1.07 NET WELLS DRILLED ........................ 120 177 245 NET WELLS AT END OF PERIOD ............... 2,242 2,697 3,572 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS General. For the year ended December 31, 2001, Chesapeake had net income of $217.4 million, or $1.25 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $969.1 million. This compares to net income of $455.6 million, or $3.01 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $628.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2000, and net income of $33.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $354.9 million during the year ended December 31, 1999. The 2001 net income included, on a pre tax basis except for the extraordinary item, $84.8 million in risk management income, a $10.1 million impairment of certain equity investments, a $27.0 million gain on the sale of our Canadian subsidiary, a $3.4 million cost for an unsecured standby credit facility associated with the acquisition of Gothic Energy Corporation, and a $46.0 million extraordinary after tax loss on early extinguishment of debt. Net income in 2000 was significantly enhanced by the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance in the amount of $265.0 million during the fourth quarter. The reversal related to Chesapeakes expected ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize net operating losses prior to their expiration. Oil and Gas Sales. During 2001, oil and gas sales increased to $735.5 million versus $470.2 million in 2000 and $280.4 million in 1999. In 2001, Chesapeake produced 161.5 bcfe at a weighted average price of $4.56 per mcfe, compared to 134.2 bcfe produced in 2000 at a weighted average price of $3.50 per mcfe, and 133.5 bcfe produced in 1999 at a weighted average price of $2.10 per mcfe. The following table shows our production by region for 1999, 2000 and 2001: YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 2000 2001 mmcfe PERCENT mmcfe PERCENT mmcfe PERCENT Mid Continent ................ 68,170 51% 78,342 58% 116,133 72% Gulf Coast ................... 43,909 33 35,154 26 27,531 17 Canada ....................... 11,737 9 12,076 9 9,075 6 Permian Basin ................ 5,722 4 6,166 5 5,029 3 Williston Basin and Other .... 3,954 3 2,441 2 3,683 2 Total production ..... 133,492 100% 134,179 100% 161,451 100% Natural gas production represented approximately 89% of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in 2001, compared to 86% in 2000 and 81% in 1999. The decrease in oil production from 1999 through 2001 is the result of divestitures that occurred primarily in 1999 and our increasing focus on natural gas. For 2001, we realized an average price per barrel of oil of $26.92, compared to $26.39 in 2000 and $16.01 in 1999. Natural gas prices per mcf were $4.56, $3.36 and $1.97 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Our hedging activities resulted in an increase in oil and gas revenues of $105.4 million or $0.65 per mcfe in 2001, a decrease of $30.6 million or $0.23 per mcfe in 2000, and a decrease of $1.7 million or $0.01 per mcfe in 1999. 23 Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in earnings. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the SFAS 133 definition of a cash flow hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income. Risk Management Income. Chesapeake recognized $84.8 million of risk management income in 2001, compared to no such income (loss) in 2000 and 1999. Risk management income for 2001 consisted of $106.8 million related to changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges less $24.5 million of reclassifications related to the settlement of such contracts plus $2.5 million associated with the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting. Pursuant to SFAS 133, our cap swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Therefore, changes in fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity, together with any change in fair value of cash flow hedges resulting from ineffectiveness, are reported in the statement of operations as risk management income (loss). Amounts recorded in risk management income (loss) do not represent cash gains or losses. Rather, these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive hedge accounting treatment. All amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms. Oil and Gas Marketing Sales. Chesapeake realized $148.7 million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in 2001, with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of $144.4 million, for a net margin of $4.3 million. This compares to sales of $157.8 million and $74.5 million, expenses of $152.3 million and $71.5 million, and margins of $5.5 million and $3.0 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2001, Chesapeake realized an increase in volumes related to oil and gas marketing sales, which was partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas prices. The increase in marketing sales and cost of sales in 2000 as compared to 1999 was due primarily to higher oil and gas prices in 2000 and the fact that we began marketing oil in June 1999. Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were $75.4 million in 2001, compared to $50.1 million and $46.3 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses were $0.47 per mcfe in 2001 compared to $0.37 and $0.35 per mcfe in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in costs on a per unit basis in 2001 is due primarily to increased field service costs, higher production costs associated with properties acquired in 2001 and an increase in ad valorem taxes. We expect that lease operating expenses per mcfe in 2002 will range from $0.50 to $0.55. Production Taxes. Production taxes were $33.0 million in 2001 compared to $24.8 million in 2000 and $13.3 million in 1999. On a unit of production basis, production taxes were $0.20, $0.19 and $0.10 per mcfe in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 of $8.2 million was due to an increase in production volumes and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas in 2001. The increase from 1999 to 2000 was the result of increased prices. In general, production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and gas prices are higher. We expect production taxes per mcfe to range from $0.18 to $0.22 in 2002 based on our assumption that oil and natural gas wellhead prices will range from $2.50 to $3.20 per mcfe. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses, which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties (see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements), were $14.4 million in 2001, $13.2 million in 2000 and $13.5 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 is the result of the companys growth related to the various acquisitions which occurred in late 2000 and during 2001. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $8.3 million, $7.0 million and $2.7 24 million of internal costs in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, directly related to our oil and gas exploration and development efforts. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses for 2002 will be between $0.10 and $0.11 per mcfe, which is approximately the same level as 2001. Oil and Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was $172.9 million, $101.3 million and $95.0 million during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The average DD&A rate per mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $1.07 ($1.08 in U.S. and $0.90 in Canada), $0.75 ($0.76 in U.S. and $0.71 in Canada) and $0.71 ($0.73 in U.S. and $0.52 in Canada) in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. We expect the 2002 DD&A rate to be between $1.15 and $1.25 per mcfe. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets was $8.7 million in 2001, compared to $7.5 million in 2000 and $7.8 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 was primarily the result of higher depreciation cost on fixed assets related to recent capital expenditures. Other property and equipment costs are depreciated on both straight line and accelerated methods. Buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis over 31.5 years. Drilling rigs are depreciated on a straight line basis over 12 years. All other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income was $2.9 million, $3.6 million and $8.6 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in 2001 was the result of a decrease in miscellaneous non oil and gas income offset by an increase in interest income. The decrease in 2000 was due primarily to gains on sales of various non oil and gas assets during 1999 which did not occur in 2000. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $98.3 million in 2001, compared to $86.3 million in 2000 and $81.1 million in 1999. The increase in 2001 is due to a $260.0 million increase in average long term borrowings in 2001 compared to 2000, partially offset by a decrease in the overall average interest rate. The increase in 2000 compared to 1999 was due to additional borrowings under our bank credit facility. In addition to the interest expense reported, we capitalized $4.7 million of interest during 2001, compared to $2.4 million capitalized in 2000, and $3.5 million capitalized in 1999 on significant investments in unproved properties that were not being currently depreciated, depleted or amortized and on which exploration activities were in progress. Interest is capitalized using the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings. We anticipate that capitalized interest for 2002 will be between $5.0 million and $6.0 million. Impairments of Investments in Securities. During 2001 we recorded impairments to two equity investments of $10.1 million. The majority of this impairment was related to our investment in RAM Energy, Inc. In March 2001, we issued 1.1 million shares of Chesapeake common stock in exchange for 49.5% of RAMs outstanding common stock. Our shares were valued at $8.854 each, or $9.9 million in total. During 2001, we recorded our equity in RAMs net losses, which had the effect of reducing our carrying value in these securities to $8.6 million. In December 2001, we sold the RAM shares for minimal consideration. In addition, we reduced the carrying value of our $2.0 million investment in an Internet based oil and gas business by $1.5 million to $0.5 million. Gain on Sale of Canadian Subsidiary. In October 2001, we sold our Canadian subsidiary, which had oil and gas operations primarily in northeast British Columbia, for approximately $143.0 million. Under full cost accounting, our investment in these Canadian oil and gas properties was treated as a separate cost center for accounting purposes. As a result of the sale of this cost center, any gain or loss on the disposition is required to be recognized currently in earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a gain on sale of our Canadian subsidiary of $27.0 million. Gothic Standby Credit Facility Costs. During 2000, we obtained a standby commitment for a $275 million credit facility, consisting of a $175 million term loan and a $100 million revolving credit facility which, if needed, would have replaced our then existing revolving credit facility. The term loan was available to provide funds to repurchase any of Gothic Production Corporations 11.125% senior secured notes tendered following the closing of the Gothic acquisition in January 2001 pursuant to a change of control offer to purchase. In February 2001, we purchased $1.0 million of notes tendered for 101% of such amount. We did not use the standby credit facility and the commitment terminated on February 23, 2001. Chesapeake incurred $3.4 million of costs for the standby facility, which were recognized in the first quarter of 2001. Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. During 2001, we purchased or redeemed $500.0 million principal amount of our 9.625% senior notes, $202.3 million principal amount of the 11.125% senior secured notes of Gothic Production Corporation, a Chesapeake subsidiary, and all $120.0 million principal amount of our 9.125% senior notes. The purchase and redemption of these notes included payment of aggregate make whole and redemption premiums of $75.6 million and the write off of unamortized debt costs and debt issue premiums. These costs associated with early extinguishment of debt are reflected as a $46.0 million after tax extraordinary loss in 2001. 25 Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Chesapeake recorded income tax expense of $175.0 million in 2001, compared to income tax benefit of $259.4 million in 2000 and income tax expense of $1.8 million in 1999. Income tax expense for 2001 is comprised of $158.3 million related to our domestic operations, $7.1 million related to our Canadian operations and $9.6 million related to the sale of our Canadian subsidiary. The income tax benefit in 2000 was comprised of $5.6 million of income tax expense related to our Canadian operations and the reversal of a $265 million deferred tax valuation allowance which was established in prior years. The valuation allowance had been established due to uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize extensive regular tax NOLs prior to their expiration. Based upon our results of operations as of December 31, 2000, the improved outlook for the natural gas industry and our projected results of future operations, we believed it was more likely than not that Chesapeake would be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our existing NOLs prior to their expiration. Consequently, we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required at December 31, 2000. Our expectations remain unchanged as of December 31, 2001. The income tax expense recorded in 1999 was related entirely to our Canadian operations. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities (exclusive of changes in working capital) was $518.6 million in 2001, compared to $305.8 million in 2000 and $138.7 million in 1999. The $212.8 million increase from 2000 to 2001 was primarily due to increased oil and gas revenues resulting from higher sales volume and higher prices. The $167.1 million increase from 1999 to 2000 was primarily due to increased oil and gas revenues resulting from higher prices. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities increased to $670.1 million in 2001, compared to $325.2 million in 2000 and $153.9 million in 1999. During 2001, Chesapeake invested $421.0 million for exploration and development drilling, invested $316.7 million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties, received $1.4 million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties and received $142.9 million for the sale of our Canadian subsidiary. In 2001, we invested $40.2 million in securities of other companies, including $22.5 million in notes and warrants of Seven Seas Petroleum Inc., $14.6 million in notes of RAM Energy, Inc. and $3.1 million in other equity securities. We also invested $14.1 million in drilling rig equipment, $11.0 million in our Oklahoma City office complex and $10.6 million on upgrading various other properties and equipment. During 2000, Chesapeake invested $188.8 million for exploration and development drilling, invested $78.9 million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties, and received $1.5 million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties. We invested $36.7 million in connection with our acquisition of Gothic Energy Corporation, including the purchase of Gothic notes and acquisition related costs. We also invested $7.9 million in drilling rig equipment. Additionally in 2000, we invested $4.0 million in our Oklahoma City office complex. In 1999, we invested $153.3 million for exploration and development drilling, invested $49.9 million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties, and received $45.6 million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $234.5 million in 2001, compared to $27.7 million used in 2000 and $13.1 million provided in 1999. During 2001, we borrowed $433.5 million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of $458.5 million. In 2001, we received $780.6 million from the issuance of our $800.0 million 8.125% senior notes in April and $247.7 million from the issuance of our $250.0 million 8.375% senior notes in November. We used $906.0 million to purchase or redeem various Chesapeake and Gothic senior notes. We incurred $6.6 million of deferred charges related to our credit facility. In November 2001, we issued $150.0 million in preferred stock and received $145.1 million of net proceeds. We received $3.2 million from the exercise of employee and director stock options. We paid $3.3 million for make whole provisions in the fourth quarter 2001 related to the exchange of our common stock for RAM Energy, Inc. common stock which occurred in March 2001. Preferred stock dividends of $1.1 million were paid in 2001. During 2000, we borrowed $244.0 million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of $262.5 million. Also in 2000, we paid $8.3 million in connection with exchanges of our preferred stock for our common stock and paid cash dividends of $4.6 million on our preferred stock. In connection with our purchase of Gothic notes in 2000, we received $7.1 million cash from the sellers of Gothic notes pursuant to make whole provisions included in the purchase agreements. These provisions required payments to be made by the sellers to us, or additional payments to be made by us to the sellers, depending upon changes in market value of our common stock during a specified period pending registration of our common stock issued to the sellers of Gothic notes. During 1999, we borrowed $116.5 million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of $98.0 million. 26 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Sources of Liquidity Chesapeake had working capital of $188.0 million at December 31, 2001, of which $125.0 million was cash. Another source of liquidity is our $225 million revolving bank credit facility (with a committed borrowing base of $225 million) which matures in September 2003. We believe we will have adequate resources, including budgeted operating cash flows, working capital and proceeds from our revolving bank credit facility, to fund our capital expenditure budget for exploration and development activities during 2002, which is currently estimated to be approximately $300 million. However, higher drilling and field operating costs, unfavorable drilling results or other factors could cause us to reduce our drilling program, which is largely discretionary. Based on our current cash flow assumptions, we expect operating cash flow to be between $325 million and $350 million. Any operating cash flow not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions, debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in 2002. A significant portion of our liquidity is concentrated in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, and derivative instruments that enable us to hedge a portion of our exposure to price volatility from producing oil and natural gas. These arrangements expose us to credit risk from our counterparties. Our mark to market position and closed but uncollected receivable with our largest counterparty, Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., totaled $137.8 million at December 31, 2001. We do not expect that Morgan Stanley or our other counterparties will fail to meet their obligations given their high credit ratings. Other financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments and accounts receivables. Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas products and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate. The industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with major banks or institutions with high credit ratings. Our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements, such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities. We have not relied on off balance sheet financing arrangements in the past and we do not intend to rely on such arrangements in the future as a source of liquidity. We are not a commercial paper issuer. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments We have a $225 million revolving bank credit facility (with a committed borrowing base of $225 million) which matures in September 2003. As of December 31, 2001, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and had $1.1 million of the facility securing various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at either the reference rate of Union Bank of California, N.A., or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our option, plus a margin that varies according to total facility usage. The collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee of 0.50%. Interest is payable quarterly. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions including incurring additional indebtedness, selling properties, paying dividends, purchasing or redeeming our capital stock, making investments or loans or purchasing certain of our senior notes, creating liens, and making acquisitions. The credit facility agreement requires us to maintain a current ratio of at least 1 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 to 1. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2001, senior notes represented $1.3 billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following: $800.0 million principal amount of 8.125% senior notes due 2011, $250.0 million principal amount of 8.375% senior notes due 2008, $150.0 million principal amount of 7.875% senior notes due 2004 and $142.7 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due 2012. There are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the senior notes until March 2004, when $137.0 million is due, as a result of the repurchase and retirement of 27 $13.0 million of our 7.875% senior notes in March 2002. Debt ratings for the senior notes are B1 by Moodys Investor Service, B+ by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and BB by Fitch Ratings as of December 31, 2001. Debt ratings for our secured bank credit facility are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service, BB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and BB+ by Fitch Ratings. Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness. All of our wholly owned subsidiaries except Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. guarantee the notes. The 7.875% senior notes are redeemable at our option at any time prior to March 15, 2004 at the make whole price determined in accordance with the indenture. On or after March 15, 2004, we may redeem the 8.5% senior notes at the redemption price set forth in the indenture. We may redeem all or some of the 8.125% senior notes at any time on and after April 1, 2006 at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture and prior to such date pursuant to make whole provisions in the indenture. We may redeem the 8.375% senior notes at any time on and after November 1, 2005 at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture and prior to such date pursuant to make whole provisions in the indenture. If we repurchase at least $75 million of the 7.875% senior notes by August 31, 2003, we may extend the bank credit facility until June 2005 for an amount equal to the total revolving credit facility commitment less the outstanding amount of the 7.875% senior notes plus $50 million. The indentures for the 8.125% and 8.375% senior notes contain covenants limiting our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted payments; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The debt incurrence covenants do not affect our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2001, we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately $383 million could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant. The indenture covenants do not apply to Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., an unrestricted subsidiary.

At December 31, 2001, we were not required to post any collateral. Future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties and highly volatile natural gas and oil prices. Investing and Financing Transactions During 2001 We completed the acquisition of Gothic Energy Corporation on January 16, 2001 by merging a wholly owned subsidiary into Gothic. We issued a total of 4.0 million common shares in the merger. Gothic shareholders (other than Chesapeake) received 0.1908 of a share of Chesapeake common stock for each share of Gothic common stock. In addition, outstanding warrants and options to purchase Gothic common stock were converted to the right to purchase Chesapeake common stock based on the merger exchange ratio. As of December 31, 2001, 1.1 million 28 shares of Chesapeake common stock may be purchased upon the exercise of such warrants and options at an average price of $12.48 per share. In 2000, Chesapeake purchased substantially all of Gothics 14.125% senior secured discount notes for total consideration of $80.8 million in cash and Chesapeake common stock. We also purchased $31.6 million principal amount of 11.125% senior secured notes due 2005 issued by Gothics operating subsidiary for total consideration of $34.8 million in cash and Chesapeake common stock. Subsequent to the acquisition, we redeemed all remaining Gothic 14.125% discount notes for total consideration of $243,000. In February 2001, we purchased $1.0 million principal amount of Gothic senior secured notes tendered pursuant to a change of control offer at a purchase price of 101%. During April and May 2001, we purchased or redeemed the remaining $202.3 million of Gothic 11.125% senior secured notes for total consideration of $225.9 million. On May 14, 2001, Gothic Energy Corporation and Gothic Production Corporation became guarantor subsidiaries of Chesapeakes senior notes. During the first quarter 2001, we purchased and subsequently retired $7.3 million of our 8.5% senior notes due 2012 for total consideration of $7.4 million, including accrued interest of $0.2 million and the write off of $0.1 million of unamortized bond discount. On March 30, 2001, we issued 1.1 million shares of Chesapeake common stock in exchange for 49.5% of RAM Energy, Inc.s, outstanding common stock. Our shares were valued at $8.854 each, or $9.9 million in total. We agreed to adjust the consideration for our acquisition of RAM shares by making a cash payment to the selling RAM shareholders equal to the shortfall if they sold the Chesapeake shares they received at a price less than $8.854 per share. In the third quarter of 2001, the RAM shareholders sold all their shares of Chesapeake common stock at prices below this level and we made make whole cash payments of $3.3 million to them to cover the shortfall. In December 2001, we sold all the RAM shares we owned for minimal consideration. In addition during 2001, we purchased $17.4 million principal amount of RAMs corporate notes for a total purchase price of $15.2 million, including accrued interest of $0.6 million. On December 4, 2001 we purchased certain oil and gas assets owned by RAM located primarily in the Mid Continent. The consideration for this acquisition was $74.4 million, consisting of $61.7 million of cash, surrender of $11.5 million principal amount of our RAM notes including $0.4 million in accrued interest, and cancellation of a $1.2 million receivable by us from RAM. Subsequent to year end, we sold the remaining $6.3 million principal amount of RAM notes, which had a carrying value on our books of $3.8 million, for $4.4 million, including accrued interest of $0.2 million. On April 6, 2001, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 8.125% senior notes due 2011, all of which were subsequently exchanged for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The net proceeds were approximately $780.6 million. During April 2001, we used a portion of the offering proceeds to purchase $140.7 million principal amount of our 9.625% senior notes and $3.0 million principal amount of the 11.125% senior secured notes of Gothic Production Corporation, a Chesapeake subsidiary. On May 7, 2001, we redeemed all $120.0 million principal amount of our 9.125% senior notes, the remaining $359.3 million principal amount of our 9.625% senior notes and the remaining $199.3 million principal amount of Gothic Production Corporations 11.125% senior secured notes. The purchase and redemption of these notes included payment of aggregate make whole and redemption premiums of $75.6 million and the write off of unamortized debt costs and debt issue premiums. The costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt were reflected as a $46.0 million after tax extraordinary loss in 2001. The refinancing lowered the interest rate and extended the maturity of approximately 74% of our senior notes outstanding at that time. In 2001, holders of our 7% cumulative convertible preferred stock converted 622,768 shares into 4,480,171 shares of common stock (at a conversion price of $6.95 per share), and we redeemed the remaining 1,269 shares of 7% preferred stock for 7,239 shares of common stock and $3,000 of cash (at a redemption price of $52.45 per share, paid in 5.7 shares of common stock and cash of $2.45). In July 2001, we purchased $22.5 million principal amount of 12% senior secured notes due 2004 issued by Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. and detachable seven year warrants to purchase approximately 12.6 million shares of Seven Seas common stock at an exercise price of approximately $1.78 per share. The shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants represent approximately 20% of Seven Seas outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. Seven Seas common stock is listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange and the common shares underlying our warrants have been registered under the federal securities laws for resale. The 12% senior secured notes held by us and the $22.5 million of notes acquired by other parties are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets owned by Seven Seas, including all of the Seven Seas subsidiaries which hold the concessions to the companys oil and gas interests in Colombia. On September 21, 2001, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of our common stock, either through direct purchases or put options. We have not made any repurchases or written any put options to date under this program. The consent to the stock repurchase program we obtained under our bank credit facility expires June 30, 2002. 29 On November 5, 2001, Chesapeake closed a private offering of $250.0 million of 8.375% senior notes due 2008, all of which were exchanged on January 23, 2002 for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The net proceeds were approximately $247.7 million. The 8.375% senior notes will be redeemable by us prior to November 1, 2005 by payment of a make whole premium, and on and after November 1, 2005 at annually declining redemption prices. The 8.375% senior notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our other outstanding senior notes and are subject to covenants substantially similar to those contained in the indenture for our 8.125% senior notes. On November 13, 2001, Chesapeake issued 3.0 million shares of 6.75% cumulative convertible preferred stock, par value $.01 per share and a liquidation preference of $50 per share, in a private offering. The net proceeds from the offering were $145.1 million. Each preferred share is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into 6.4935 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment. The conversion rate is based on an initial conversion price of $7.70 per common share, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The preferred stock is subject to mandatory conversion, at our option, (1) on or after November 20, 2004 at the same rate if the market price of the common stock equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price at the time and (2) on or after November 20, 2006 at the lower of the conversion price and the then current market price of the common stock if there are less than 250,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time. Annual cumulative cash dividends of $3.375 per share are payable quarterly on the fifteenth day of each February, May, August and November. We have registered under the Securities Act of 1933 shares of the preferred stock and underlying common stock for resale by the holders. In private transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2001 and January 2002, we acquired 7.65% of the outstanding common stock of Canaan Energy Corporation, an oil and gas exploration and production company, for cash consideration totaling $4.0 million, or $12.00 per share. On March 11, 2002, we announced our intention to commence a cash tender offer to acquire Canaan for $12.00 per share of common stock. The $12.00 offer price represents an aggregate purchase price for the common stock on a fully diluted basis of approximately $55.0 million plus the assumption of Canaans debt, which was approximately $42.0 million as of December 31, 2001. On March 15, 2002, we announced that we would defer commencement of the tender offer based upon the representations of Canaan senior management of their willingness to engage in good faith discussions with us regarding the offer and upon their request that we delay commencement of the tender offer until after the discussions. We may at any time commence or modify our proposed tender offer for Canaan shares or terminate our tender offer plans. If and when the tender offer is commenced, the complete terms and conditions of the offer will be set forth in tender offer materials that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In March 2002, we purchased and subsequently retired $13.0 million of our 7.875% senior notes due 2004 for total consideration of $13.7 million, including accrued interest of $0.4 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The three most significant policies are discussed below. Hedging. From time to time, Chesapeake uses commodity price risk management instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates. Recognized gains and losses on hedge contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results of oil and gas hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to our oil and gas production. The changes in fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as cash flow hedges that occur prior to maturity are initially reported in the consolidated statement of operations as risk management income (loss). All amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within the same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contracts terms. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the 30 hedged item over time. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in earnings. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the SFAS 133 definition of a cash flow hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income. See Hedging Activities and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Oil and Gas Properties. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 72% of our present value (discounted at 10%) of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves was evaluated by independent petroleum engineers, with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers. In addition, our internal engineers reevaluate our reserves on a quarterly basis. Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. We review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which Chesapeake operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as derivative instruments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. These differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent Chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations. HEDGING ACTIVITIES Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas. To mitigate a portion of this exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into derivative instruments. All of our derivative instruments have been entered into as hedges of oil and gas price risk and not for speculative purposes. We utilize derivative instruments to reduce exposure to unfavorable changes in oil and gas prices which are subject to significant and often volatile fluctuations. As of December 31, 2001, our derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, collars, cap swaps and locked swaps. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production. Pursuant to SFAS 133, our cap swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity, together with any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges resulting from ineffectiveness, are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as risk management income (loss). Amounts recorded in risk management income (loss) do not represent cash gains or losses. Rather, these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive hedge accounting treatment. All amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms. 31 The estimated fair values of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2001 are provided below. The associated carrying values of these instruments are equal to the estimated fair values.

As of December 31, 2001, we had accounts receivable from our CEO and COO of $5.0 million and $4.9 million, respectively, representing joint interest billings payable within 90 days. Under their employment agreements, the CEO and COO are permitted to participate in all, or none, of the wells spudded by or on behalf of Chesapeake during each calendar quarter, but they are not allowed to only participate in select wells. A participation election is required to be received by the Compensation Committee of Chesapeakes board of directors 30 days prior to the start of a quarter. Their participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in their employment agreements, which, among other things, limit their participation to a maximum working interest of 2.5% in a well and prohibits participation in situations where Chesapeakes working interest would be reduced below 12.5% as a result of their participation. In October 2001, we sold Chesapeake Canada Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary, for net proceeds of approximately $143.0 million. Our CEO and COO each received $2.0 million related to their fractional ownership interest in these Canadian assets, which they acquired and paid for pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements. The portion of the proceeds allocated to our CEO and COO was based upon the estimated fair values of the assets sold as determined by management and the independent members of our board of directors using a methodology similar to that used by Chesapeake for acquisitions of assets from disinterested third parties. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, we paid legal fees of $391,000, $439,000 and $398,000, respectively, for legal services provided by a law firm of which a director is a member. 32 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS Nos. 141 and 142. SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach and will be effective January 2002. We believe that adoption of this new standard will not have an effect on our results of operations or our financial position. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. We have not yet determined the effect of the adoption of SFAS 143 on our financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2002. This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 for the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations, as it relates to long lived assets. We believe the future impact of the adoption of SFAS 144 on our financial position or results of operations will not be material. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This report includes "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include statements regarding oil and gas reserve estimates, planned capital expenditures, the drilling of oil and gas wells and future acquisitions, expected oil and gas production, cash flow and anticipated liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations, expected future expenses and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. Statements concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under "Risk Factors" in Item 1 and include: o the volatility of oil and gas prices, o our substantial indebtedness, o the cost and availability of drilling and production services, o our commodity price risk management activities, including counterparty contract performance risk, o uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves, projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures, o our ability to replace reserves, o the availability of capital, o uncertainties in evaluating oil and gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities, o drilling and operating risks, o our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize our NOLs before expiration, o future ownership changes which could result in additional limitations to our NOLs, o adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, o losses possible from pending or future litigation, o the strength and financial resources of our competitors, and o the loss of officers or key employees. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business. 33 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas. To mitigate a portion of this exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into derivative instruments. All of our derivative instruments have been entered into as hedges of oil and gas price risk and not for speculative purposes. We utilize derivative instruments to reduce exposure to unfavorable changes in oil and gas prices which are subject to significant and often volatile fluctuations. As of December 31, 2001, our derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, collars, cap swaps and locked swaps. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production. o For swap instruments, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price, as defined in each instrument, to the counterparty. The fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. o Collars contain a fixed floor price (put) and ceiling price (call). If the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price, then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price. If the market price is between the call and the put strike price, then no payments are due from either party. o For cap swaps, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a "cap" on the floating market price, which limits the counterpartys exposure. o Locked swaps consist of swap positions which have been effectively closed by entering into a counter swap instrument where we receive the floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty. At the time we enter into the counter swap, the original swap is designated as a non qualifying cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. The net values of both the swap and counter swap are frozen and shown as derivatives receivable or payable in the consolidated balance sheet. Pursuant to SFAS 133, our cap swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity are reported in the statement of operations as risk management income (loss). Amounts recorded in risk management income (loss) do not represent cash gains or losses. Rather, these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive hedge accounting treatment. All amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms. The estimated fair values of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2001 are provided below. The associated carrying values of these instruments are equal to the estimated fair values. DECEMBER 31, 2001 ($ IN THOUSANDS) Derivative assets: Fixed price gas cap swaps ........................................................ $ 77,208 Fixed price gas locked swaps ..................................................... 50,549 Fixed price gas collars .......................................................... 15,360 Fixed price gas swaps ............................................................ 6,268 Fixed price crude oil cap swaps .................................................. 5,078 Fixed price crude oil locked swaps ............................................... 2,846 Total .......................................................................... $157,309 We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates of fair value reported by our counterparties. The actual contribution to our future results of operations will be based on the market prices at the time of settlement and may be more or less than the fair value estimates used at December 31, 2001. 34 Risk management income in the consolidated statement of operations for 2001 is comprised of the following: 2001 ($ IN THOUSANDS) Risk Management Income: Change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting .... $ 106,825 Reclassification of settled contracts ...................................... (24,540) Ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting ......... 2,504 Total .................................................................... $ 84,789 Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. The change in fair value of our derivative instruments since January 1, 2001 resulted from a decrease in market prices for natural gas and crude oil. The majority of this change in fair value is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of deferred income tax effects, in the December 31, 2001 consolidated balance sheet. Derivative assets reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for oil and gas as of the balance sheet date. The derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs. We expect to transfer approximately $33.7 million of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income, based upon the market prices at December 31, 2001, to earnings during the next 12 months when the forecasted transactions actually occur. All forecasted transactions hedged as of December 31, 2001 are expected to occur by December 2003. As of December 31, 2001, we had the following open derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of our gas production for periods after December 2001: SWAPS CAP SWAPS COLLARS NYMEX NYMEX CAPPED INDEX LOW LOW HIGH STRIKE STRIKE STRIKE STRIKE STRIKE PRICE PRICE PRICE PRICE PRICE VOLUME ($ PER VOLUME ($ PER ($ PER VOLUME ($ PER ($ PER (mmbtu) mmbtu) (mmbtu) mmbtu) mmbtu) (mmbtu) mmbtu) mmbtu) 1st Quarter 2002 ...... 17,320,000 2.70 18,900,000 5.32 4.09 1,800,000 4.00 5.75 2nd Quarter 2002 ...... 18,820,000 2.75 22,750,000 4.55 3.55 3,640,000 4.00 5.38 3rd Quarter 2002 ...... 16,560,000 2.85 23,000,000 4.57 3.57 3,680,000 4.00 5.38 4th Quarter 2002 ...... 18,120,000 4.49 3.49 2,460,000 4.00 5.56 Total 2002 .......... 52,700,000 2.76 82,770,000 4.72 3.67 11,580,000 4.00 5.47 1st Quarter 2003 ...... 12,600,000 3.79 2.79 2nd Quarter 2003 ...... 12,740,000 3.42 2.42 3rd Quarter 2003 ...... 12,880,000 3.50 2.50 4th Quarter 2003 ...... 12,880,000 3.69 2.69 Total 2003 .......... 51,100,000 3.60 2.60 The above table does not include locked swaps of 43,510,000 mmbtu for 2002 and 55,340,000 mmbtu for 2003. Subsequent to December 31, 2001, we settled the gas swaps, gas cap swaps and gas collars for January, February and March 2002. Gains totaling $45.2 million will be recognized as price adjustments in the first quarter of 2002 and are comprised of $19.1 million for gas swaps, $23.2 million for gas cap swaps and $2.9 million for gas collars. Any associated gains related to cap swaps and the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting that were recognized during 2001 as risk management income will be reclassified from risk management income to oil and gas sales during 2002. 35 As of December 31, 2001, we had the following open derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of our domestic crude oil production for periods after December 2001: CAP SWAPS NYMEX NYMEX CAPPED INDEX LOW STRIKE VOLUME STRIKE PRICE PRICE (bbls) ($ per bbl) ($ per bbl) 1st Quarter 2002 .... 270,000 25.64 20.64 2nd Quarter 2002 .... 273,000 25.41 20.41 3rd Quarter 2002 .... 276,000 25.18 20.18 4th Quarter 2002 .... 276,000 24.98 19.98 Total 2002 ....... 1,095,000 25.30 20.30 Subsequent to December 31, 2001, we settled the oil cap swaps for January and February 2002 for gains of $1.0 million for oil swaps and $0.8 million for oil cap swaps. Any associated gains related to cap swaps and the ineffectiveness portions of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting that were recognized during 2001 as risk management income will be reclassified from risk management income to oil and gas sales during 2002. As of December 31, 2001, we closed certain swap transactions designed to hedge a portion of our domestic oil and natural gas production. We refer to these transactions as locked swaps.

Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2001, we were not using any interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. All of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and therefore does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt. 36
