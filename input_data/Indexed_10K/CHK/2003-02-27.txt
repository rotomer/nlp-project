ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview The following table sets forth certain information regarding the production volumes, oil and gas sales, average sales prices received and expenses for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net Production: Oil (mbbl) 3,466 2,880 3,068 Gas (mmcf) 160,682 144,171 115,771 Gas equivalent (mmcfe) 181,478 161,451 134,179 Oil and Gas Sales ($ in thousands): Oil $ 87,403 $ 77,522 $ 80,953 Gas 568,051 658,007 389,217 Total oil and gas sales $ 655,454 $ 735,529 $ 470,170 Average Sales Price: Oil ($ per bbl) $ 25.22 $ 26.92 $ 26.39 Gas ($ per mcf) $ 3.54 $ 4.56 $ 3.36 Gas equivalent ($ per mcfe) $ 3.61 $ 4.56 $ 3.50 Expenses ($ per mcfe): Production expenses and taxes $ 0.71 $ 0.67 $ 0.56 General and administrative $ 0.10 $ 0.09 $ 0.10 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 1.22 $ 1.07 $ 0.75 Net Wells Drilled 279 245 177 Net Wells at End of Period 4,237 3,572 2,697 Recent Developments Our 2003 results of operations will be significantly impacted by acquisitions of oil and gas properties we have recently completed or announced and the related financings of the pending acquisitions. On January 31, 2003, we completed the acquisition of Mid Continent gas assets from a wholly owned subsidiary of Tulsa based ONEOK, Inc. for $300 million. Based on internal reservoir engineering estimates, we believe the acquisition adds approximately 200 bcfe of proved reserves. The acquisition was funded with proceeds generated from the companys December 2002 issuance of 23 million common shares at $7.50 per share and $150 million of 7.75% senior notes. On February 24, 2003, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire El Paso Corporations Anadarko Basin assets in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle for $500 million, which, by our internal estimates, will add approximately 328 bcfe to our estimated proved reserves and approximately 67 mmcfe to our daily production. We expect to close the El Paso acquisition in March 2003. On February 24, 2003, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire Vintage Petroleum, Inc.s assets in the Bray field in southern Oklahoma for $30 million, which, by our internal estimates, will add approximately 22 bcfe to our estimated proved reserves and approximately 3.5 mmcfe to our daily production. We expect to close the Vintage acquisition in March 2003. 26 Table of Contents On February 24, 2003, we announced a proposed private placement of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, a proposed public offering of 20,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our existing shelf registration statement and a proposed private placement of $200 million of convertible preferred stock. There is no assurance these proposed offerings will be completed or, if they are completed, that they will be completed for the amount contemplated. Results of Operations General. For the year ended December 31, 2002, Chesapeake had net income of $40.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $737.8 million. This compares to net income of $217.4 million, or $1.25 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $969.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2001, and net income of $455.6 million, or $3.01 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $628.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2000. The 2002 net income includes, on a pre tax basis, $88.0 million in risk management loss, a $17.2 million impairment of our investment in Seven Seas Petroleum, Inc. and a $2.6 million loss on repurchases of debt. The 2001 net income included, on a pre tax basis, $84.8 million in risk management income, a $10.1 million impairment of certain equity investments, a $27.0 million gain on the sale of our Canadian subsidiary, and a $3.4 million cost for an unsecured standby credit facility associated with the acquisition of Gothic Energy Corporation. There was also a $46.0 million extraordinary after tax loss on early extinguishment of debt. Net income in 2000 was significantly enhanced by the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance in the amount of $265.0 million. The reversal related to Chesapeakes expected ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize net operating losses prior to their expiration. Oil and Gas Sales. During 2002, oil and gas sales were $655.5 million versus $735.5 million in 2001 and $470.2 million in 2000. In 2002, Chesapeake produced 181.5 bcfe at a weighted average price of $3.61 per mcfe, compared to 161.5 bcfe produced in 2001 at a weighted average price of $4.56 per mcfe, and 134.2 bcfe produced in 2000 at a weighted average price of $3.50 per mcfe. The decline in prices in 2002 resulted in a decline in revenue of $172 million offset by $92 million due to increased production, for a net decrease in revenues of $80 million. The increase in 2001 revenues over 2000 of $265 million is due to increased prices ($171 million) and increased production ($94 million). The change in oil and gas prices has a significant impact on our oil and gas revenues and cash flows. Assuming the 2002 production levels, a change of $.10 per mcf would result in an increase/decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $16 million and $15 million, respectively, and a change of $1.00 per barrel would result in an increase/decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately $3.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively, without considering the effect of hedging activities. For 2002, we realized an average price per barrel of oil of $25.22, compared to $26.92 in 2001 and $26.39 in 2000. Natural gas prices realized per mcf were $3.54, $4.56 and $3.36 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Our hedging activities resulted in an increase in oil and gas revenues of $96.0 million or $0.53 per mcfe in 2002, an increase of $105.4 million or $0.65 per mcfe in 2001 and a decrease of $30.6 million or $0.23 per mcfe in 2000. The following table shows our production by region for 2002, 2001 and 2000: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 mmcfe Percent mmcfe Percent mmcfe Percent Mid Continent 147,348 81 % 116,133 72 % 78,342 58 % Gulf Coast 23,264 13 27,531 17 35,154 26 Canada 9,075 6 12,076 9 Permian Basin 7,637 4 5,029 3 6,166 5 Williston Basin and Other 3,229 2 3,683 2 2,441 2 Total production 181,478 100 % 161,451 100 % 134,179 100 % 27 Table of Contents Natural gas production represented approximately 89% of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in 2002, compared to 89% in 2001 and 86% in 2000. The increase in production from 2000 through 2002 is due to the combination of organic production growth during the period as well as acquisitions completed in 2001 and 2002. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized as an increase or decrease to the value of the hedged item until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in earnings. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the SFAS 133 definition of a cash flow hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income. See Hedging Activities below and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. Risk Management Income (Loss). Chesapeake recognized $88.0 million of risk management loss in 2002 compared to $84.8 million of risk management income in 2001, and no such income (loss) in 2000. Risk management income for 2002 consisted of losses of $24.0 million related to changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying as cash flow hedges, $59.7 million of reclassifications of gains on the settlement of such contracts and $3.6 million associated with the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting. It also included a gain of $4.6 million related to changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives not qualifying for fair value hedge accounting, $1.8 million of reclassifications of gains on the settlement of interest rate swaps to interest expense, and a $3.5 million loss associated with the ineffective portion of our swaption. Risk management income for 2001 consisted of $106.8 million related to changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges less $24.5 million of reclassifications related to the settlement of such contracts plus $2.5 million associated with the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting. Pursuant to SFAS 133, our cap swaps, counter swaps and basis protection swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Therefore, changes in fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity, together with any change in fair value of cash flow hedges resulting from ineffectiveness, are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as risk management income (loss). Amounts recorded in risk management income (loss) do not represent cash gains or losses. Rather, these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive either SFAS 133 cash flow or fair value hedge accounting treatment. All amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms. Oil and Gas Marketing Sales. Chesapeake realized $170.3 million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in 2002, with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of $165.7 million, for a net margin of $4.6 million. This compares to sales of $148.7 million and $157.8 million, expenses of $144.4 million and $152.3 million, and margins of $4.3 million and $5.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2002 and 2001, Chesapeake realized an increase in volumes related to oil and gas marketing sales, which was partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas prices for both years. 28 Table of Contents Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were $98.2 million in 2002, compared to $75.4 million and $50.1 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses were $0.54 per mcfe in 2002 compared to $0.47 and $0.37 per mcfe in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in costs on a per unit basis in 2002 and 2001 is due primarily to increased field service costs and higher production costs associated with properties acquired during these years. We expect that production expenses per mcfe in 2003 will range from $0.51 to $0.55. Production Taxes. Production taxes were $30.1 million in 2002 compared to $33.0 million in 2001 and $24.8 million in 2000. On a unit of production basis, production taxes were $0.17, $0.20 and $0.19 per mcfe in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in 2002 of $2.9 million was due to a decrease in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas. The increase in 2001 of $8.2 million was due to an increase in production volumes and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas. In general, production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and gas prices are higher. We expect production taxes per mcfe to range from $0.25 to $0.28 in 2003 based on our assumption that oil and natural gas wellhead prices will range from $4.00 to $4.50 per mcfe. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses, which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties (see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements), were $17.6 million in 2002, $14.4 million in 2001 and $13.2 million in 2000. The increase in 2002 and 2001 is the result of the companys growth related to the various acquisitions which occurred in 2002 and 2001. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses for 2003 will be between $0.08 and $0.10 per mcfe, which is approximately the same level as 2002. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $17.0 million, $12.9 million and $10.2 million of internal costs in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, directly related to our oil and gas exploration and development efforts. During 2002, we reversed approximately $3 million of our accrued liability previously established in connection with the West Panhandle Field cessation cases as a reduction to general and administrative expenses. In connection with a legal proceeding brought against us by certain royalty owners, we determined that a portion of the marketing fee we had charged the royalty owners should be refunded. In late 2002, we deposited with the court $3.3 million to be held in an interest bearing account for distribution to affected royalty owners which resulted in a charge to general and administrative expenses. A description of pending royalty owner litigation is included below under Liquidity and Capital Resources Contingencies. Oil and Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was $221.2 million, $172.9 million and $101.3 million during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average DD&A rate per mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $1.22 (all domestic), $1.07 ($1.08 in U.S. and $0.90 in Canada), and $0.75 ($0.76 in U.S. and $0.71 in Canada) in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We expect the 2003 DD&A rate to be between $1.30 and $1.35 per mcfe. The increase in the average rate from 2000 to 2002 is primarily the result of higher drilling costs and higher costs associated with acquisitions. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets was $14.0 million in 2002, compared to $8.7 million in 2001 and $7.5 million in 2000. The increases in 2002 and 2001 were primarily the result of higher depreciation costs on fixed assets related to capital expenditures made in both years. Other property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis. Buildings are depreciated over 31.5 years, drilling rigs are depreciated over 12 years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over 29 Table of Contents the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. To the extent the drilling rigs are used to drill our wells, a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in oil and gas properties as exploration or development costs. We expect 2003 depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between $0.08 and $0.10 per mcfe. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income was $7.3 million, $2.9 million and $3.6 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 was the result of income recognized on our investments in Seven Seas and RAM and interest earned on overnight investments. The decrease in 2001 was the result of a decrease in miscellaneous non oil and gas income offset by an increase in interest income. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $111.3 million in 2002, compared to $98.3 million in 2001 and $86.3 million in 2000. The increase in 2002 is due to a $264 million increase in average long term borrowings in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in 2001 is due to a $260 million increase in average long term borrowings in 2001 compared to 2000, partially offset by a decrease in the overall average interest rate. In addition to the interest expense reported, we capitalized $5.0 million of interest during 2002, compared to $4.7 million capitalized in 2001, and $2.4 million capitalized in 2000 on significant investments in unproved properties that were not being currently depreciated, depleted or amortized and on which exploration activities were in progress. Interest is capitalized using the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings. We expect 2003 interest expense to be between $0.65 and $0.70 per mcfe. Loss on Investments in Seven Seas. In July 2001, Chesapeake purchased $22.5 million principal amount of 12% senior secured notes due 2004 issued by Seven Seas Petroleum, Inc. and detachable seven year warrants to purchase approximately 12.6 million shares of Seven Seas common stock at an exercise price of approximately $1.78 per share. The 12% senior secured notes held by us, and the $22.5 million of notes acquired by other parties, are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets owned by Seven Seas. In December 2002, Seven Seas announced that it was in default under the senior secured notes. On December 13, 2002, we accelerated all amounts owing to us. On December 14, 2002, Seven Seas announced that it had entered into an agreement with an independent third party to sell its interests in the Guaduas oil field in Colombia for $20 million. Later in December 2002, holders of its senior unsecured notes filed an involuntary Chapter 7 petition in bankruptcy against Seven Seas. In January 2003, the case was converted to a Chapter 11 proceeding and a bankruptcy trustee was appointed. The asset sale closed on February 21, 2003. Seven Seas has reported that the only material assets remaining are its rights associated with the Deep Dindal association contract and certain Colombian tax assets. Seven Seas has also said it will not have sufficient cash to conduct additional operations. In the third quarter of 2002, Chesapeake recorded an impairment of $4.8 million representing 100% of the cost allocated to our Seven Seas common stock warrants. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded an additional impairment of $12.4 million to reduce our net investment in the senior secured notes, including accrued interest, to $7.5 million, representing Chesapeakes anticipated share of the net proceeds from the liquidation of Seven Seas assets. Loss on Repurchases of Debt. During 2002, we purchased and subsequently retired $107.9 million of our 7.875% senior notes due 2004 for total consideration of $112.9 million, including accrued interest of $1.3 million and $3.7 million of redemption premium partially offset by a $1.7 million gain from interest rate hedging activities associated with the retired debt. Impairments of Investments in Securities. During 2001 we recorded impairments to two equity investments of $10.1 million. The majority of this impairment was related to our investment in RAM Energy, Inc. In March 2001, we issued 1.1 million shares of Chesapeake common stock in exchange for 49.5% of RAMs outstanding common stock. Our shares were valued at $8.854 each, or $9.9 million in total. During 2001, we recorded our equity in RAMs net losses, which had the effect of reducing our carrying value in these securities 30 Table of Contents to $8.6 million. In December 2001, we sold the RAM shares for minimal consideration. In addition, we reduced the carrying value of our $2.0 million investment in an Internet based oil and gas business by $1.5 million to $0.5 million. Gain on Sale of Canadian Subsidiary. In October 2001, we sold our Canadian subsidiary, which had oil and gas operations primarily in northeast British Columbia, for approximately $143.0 million. Under full cost accounting, our investment in these Canadian oil and gas properties was treated as a separate cost center for accounting purposes. As a result of the sale of this cost center, any gain or loss on the disposition was required to be recognized in current earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a gain on sale of our Canadian subsidiary of $27.0 million. Gothic Standby Credit Facility Costs. During 2000, we obtained a standby commitment for a $275 million credit facility, consisting of a $175 million term loan and a $100 million revolving credit facility which, if needed, would have replaced our then existing revolving credit facility. The term loan was available to provide funds to repurchase any of Gothic Production Corporations 11.125% senior secured notes tendered following the closing of the Gothic acquisition in January 2001 pursuant to a change of control offer to purchase. In February 2001, we purchased $1.0 million of notes tendered for 101% of such amount. We did not use the standby credit facility and the commitment terminated on February 23, 2001. Chesapeake incurred $3.4 million of costs for the standby facility, which were recognized in the first quarter of 2001. Extraordinary Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. During 2001, we purchased or redeemed $500.0 million principal amount of our 9.625% senior notes, $202.3 million principal amount of the 11.125% senior secured notes of Gothic Production Corporation, a Chesapeake subsidiary, and all $120.0 million principal amount of our 9.125% senior notes. These redemptions were done as a part of a refinancing of approximately 74% of our senior note debt and 72% of our total long term debt outstanding. Even though we purchase our outstanding senior notes from time to time, the refinancing of the majority of our senior debt was an unusual non recurring event and as such we have reported it as an extraordinary item in accordance with APB 30. See Recently Issued Accounting Standards within this Item 7. The purchase and redemption of these notes included payment of aggregate make whole and redemption premiums of $75.6 million and the write off of unamortized debt costs and debt issue premiums. These costs associated with early extinguishment of debt are reflected as a $46.0 million after tax extraordinary loss in 2001. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Chesapeake recorded income tax expense of $26.9 million in 2002, compared to income tax expense of $175.0 million in 2001 and income tax benefit of $259.4 million in 2000. All income tax expense for 2002 is related to our domestic operations. Income tax expense for 2001 is comprised of $158.3 million related to our domestic operations, $7.1 million related to our Canadian operations and $9.6 million related to the sale of our Canadian subsidiary. The income tax benefit in 2000 was comprised of $5.6 million of income tax expense related to our Canadian operations and the reversal of a $265 million deferred tax valuation allowance which was established in prior years. The valuation allowance had been established due to uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize extensive regular tax NOLs prior to their expiration. Based upon our results of operations as of December 31, 2000, the improved outlook for the natural gas industry and our projected results of future operations, we believed it was more likely than not that Chesapeake would be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our existing NOLs prior to their expiration. Consequently, we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required at December 31, 2000. As of December 31, 2001, we determined that it was more likely than not that $2.4 million of the deferred tax assets related to Louisiana net operating losses will not be realized and we recorded a valuation allowance equal to such amounts. Our expectations remain unchanged as of December 31, 2002. Cash Flows From Operating, Investing and Financing Activities Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities (exclusive of changes in working capital) was $412.5 million in 2002, compared to $518.6 million in 2001 and $305.8 million in 2000. 31 Table of Contents The $106.1 million decrease from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to decreased oil and gas revenues resulting from lower prices partially offset by higher volumes and the increase in 2001 over 2000 was due to significantly higher gas prices and higher volumes of both oil and gas. Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities increased to $779.7 million in 2002, compared to $670.1 million in 2001 and $325.2 million in 2000. During 2002, Chesapeake invested cash of $400.2 million for exploration and development drilling and $331.7 million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties, and we received $0.8 million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties. In 2002, we invested $2.4 million in securities of other companies. We also invested $3.6 million in drilling rig equipment, $17.0 million in our Oklahoma City office complex and $16.6 million on upgrading various other properties and equipment. During 2001, Chesapeake invested cash of $421.0 million for exploration and development drilling and $316.7 million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties, and we received $1.4 million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties and $142.9 million for the sale of our Canadian subsidiary. In 2001, we invested $40.2 million in securities of other companies, including $22.5 million in notes and warrants of Seven Seas Petroleum Inc., $14.6 million in notes of RAM Energy, Inc. and $3.1 million in other equity securities. We also invested $14.1 million in drilling rig equipment, $11.0 million in our Oklahoma City office complex and $10.6 million on upgrading various other properties and equipment. During 2000, Chesapeake invested $188.8 million for exploration and development drilling, invested $78.9 million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties, and received $1.5 million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties. We invested $36.7 million in connection with our acquisition of Gothic Energy Corporation, including the purchase of Gothic notes and acquisition related costs. We also invested $7.9 million in Advanced Drilling Technologies, L.L.C. Additionally in 2000, we invested $4.0 million in our Oklahoma City office complex. Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $477.3 million in 2002, compared to $234.5 million in 2001 and $27.7 million used in 2000. During 2002, we borrowed $252.5 million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of $252.5 million. We incurred $2.9 million of deferred charges related to the amendment of our bank credit facility. In 2002, we received $298.1 million from the issuance of our $300 million 9% senior notes in August and November and $148.5 million from the issuance of our $150 million 7.75% senior notes in December. We incurred $7.2 million of costs related to the issuance of these notes. In December 2002, we issued $172.5 million in common stock and received $164.1 million of net proceeds. We received $3.8 million from the exercise of employee and director stock options. During 2002, we purchased and subsequently retired $107.9 million of our 7.875% senior notes for $111.6 million including redemption premium of $3.7 million. Preferred stock dividends of $10.2 million and common stock dividends of $5.0 million were paid in 2002. During 2001, we borrowed $433.5 million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of $458.5 million. We incurred $6.6 million of deferred charges related to our credit facility. In 2001, we received $786.7 million from the issuance of our $800.0 million 8.125% senior notes in April and $249.7 million from the issuance of our $250.0 million 8.375% senior notes in November. We used $906.0 million to purchase or redeem various Chesapeake and Gothic senior notes. We incurred $8.1 million of costs related to the issuance of these notes. In November 2001, we issued $150.0 million in preferred stock and received $145.1 million of net proceeds. We received $3.2 million from the exercise of employee and director stock options. We paid $3.3 million for make whole provisions in the fourth quarter 2001 related to the exchange of our common stock for RAM Energy, Inc. common stock which occurred in March 2001. Preferred stock dividends of $1.1 million were paid in 2001. 32 Table of Contents During 2000, we borrowed $244.0 million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of $262.5 million. Also in 2000, we paid $8.3 million in connection with exchanges of our preferred stock for our common stock and paid cash dividends of $4.6 million on our preferred stock. In connection with our purchase of Gothic notes in 2000, we received $7.1 million cash from the sellers of Gothic notes pursuant to make whole provisions included in the purchase agreements. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity Chesapeake had working capital of $169.8 million at December 31, 2002, of which $247.7 million was cash. Another source of liquidity is our $250 million revolving bank credit facility (with a committed borrowing base of $250 million) which matures in June 2005. At February 21, 2003 we had $104 million of indebtedness under the bank credit facility. We expect we will have no bank indebtedness at the conclusion of our proposed securities offerings, assuming they are all successfully closed. If the proposed offerings do not close as planned, however, we may need to use all or substantially all of our available bank borrowings to fund our pending acquisitions, which could substantially limit our liquidity. We believe we will have adequate resources, including budgeted operating cash flows, working capital and proceeds from our revolving bank credit facility, to fund our capital expenditure budget for drilling, land and seismic activities during 2003, which is currently estimated to be between $475 and $525 million. However, higher drilling and field operating costs, unfavorable drilling results or other factors could cause us to reduce our drilling program, which is largely discretionary. Based on our current cash flow assumptions, we expect operating cash flow to be between $600 million and $650 million. Any operating cash flow not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions, debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in 2003. A significant portion of our liquidity at December 31, 2002 is concentrated in cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments and accounts receivables. Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas products and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate. The industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with major banks or institutions with high credit ratings. Our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements, such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities. We have not relied on off balance sheet financing arrangements in the past and we do not intend to rely on such arrangements in the future as a source of liquidity. We are not a commercial paper issuer. Contractual Obligations We completed an acquisition of Mid Continent gas assets from a wholly owned subsidiary of Tulsa based ONEOK, Inc. in January 2003. We paid $300 million in cash for these assets, $15 million of which was paid in 2002. We have a $250 million revolving bank credit facility (with a committed borrowing base of $250 million) which matures in June 2005. As of December 31, 2002, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and utilized $25.4 million of the facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at either the reference rate of Union Bank of California, N.A., or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our option, plus a margin that varies according 33 Table of Contents to total facility usage. The collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee of 0.50%. Interest is payable quarterly. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell properties, pay dividends, purchase or redeem our capital stock, make investments or loans or purchase certain of our senior notes, create liens, and make acquisitions. The credit facility agreement requires us to maintain a current ratio (as defined) of at least 1 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined) of at least 2.5 to 1. At December 31, 2002, our current ratio was 2.5 to 1 and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.9 to 1. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $5.0 million. As of December 31, 2002, senior notes represented approximately $1.7 billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following ($ in thousands): 7.875% senior notes due 2004 $ 42,137 8.375% senior notes due 2008 250,000 8.125% senior notes due 2011 800,000 9.0% senior notes due 2012 300,000 8.5% senior notes due 2012 142,665 7.75% senior notes due 2015 150,000 $ 1,684,802 There are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the senior notes until March 2004, when $42.1 million is due. Debt ratings for the senior notes are B1 by Moodys Investor Service, B+ by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and BB by Fitch Ratings as of December 31, 2002. Debt ratings for our secured bank credit facility are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service, BB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and BB+ by Fitch Ratings. Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness. All of our wholly owned subsidiaries except Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. guarantee the notes. The indentures permit us to redeem the senior notes at any time at specified make whole or redemption prices. The indentures for the 8.125%, 8.375%, 9.0% and 7.75% senior notes contain covenants limiting our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted payments; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The debt incurrence covenants do not affect our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2002, we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately $716 million could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant. The indenture covenants do not apply to Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., which is our only unrestricted subsidiary. 34 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due By Period ($ in thousands) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt obligations $ 1,684,802 $ $ 42,137 $ $ 1,642,665 Capital lease obligations Operating lease obligations 2,804 824 1,138 325 517 Purchase obligations Standby letters of credit 26,165 26,165 Other long term obligations 2,879 846 2,033 Total contractual obligations $ 1,716,650 $ 27,835 $ 45,308 $ 325 $ 1,643,182 Some of our commodity price and financial risk management arrangements require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations with respect to our commodity price and financial risk management transactions exceed certain levels. At December 31, 2002, we were required to post $24.5 million collateral. Future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties, highly volatile natural gas and oil prices, and fluctuations in interest rates. Investing and Financing Transactions On June 28, 2002, we acquired Canaan Energy Corporation in a cash merger through a Chesapeake subsidiary, adding approximately 100 bcfe to our proved reserves. Under the agreement, all outstanding common shares of Canaan, other than the Canaan shares already owned by Chesapeake, were purchased at $18.00 per share in cash, and the outstanding options to acquire Canaan common stock were converted into the right to receive, for each share of Canaan common stock to be received upon exercise, the merger consideration less the per share exercise price and withholding taxes. The aggregate net cash consideration for the merger was $127 million, including the retirement of Canaans outstanding indebtedness of approximately $43 million. During the third quarter of 2002, we completed four separate acquisitions of Mid Continent oil and gas properties for an aggregate cash purchase price of $165 million. We estimate these acquisitions added approximately 124 bcfe of proved reserves. The acquisitions included privately held Focus Energy, Inc. and its related partnerships, the Mid Continent assets of publicly traded EnCana Corporation, the Mid Continent assets of OG&E Energy Corp. and the Anadarko Basin assets of The Williams Companies, Inc. During 2002, we purchased and subsequently retired $107.9 million of our 7.875% senior notes due 2004 for total consideration of $112.9 million, including accrued interest of $1.3 million and $3.7 million of redemption premium partially offset by a $1.7 million gain from interest rate hedging activities associated with the retired debt. In July 2002, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that permits us, over time, to sell up to $500 million of debt securities or common stock, in any combination. Net proceeds, terms and pricing of the offerings of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings. We offered and sold $172.5 million of common stock in December 2002, pursuant to a supplement to the registration statement. In August 2002, we closed a private offering of $250 million principal amount of 9.0% senior notes due 2012, all of which were exchanged in October 2002 for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The net proceeds from this issuance of $242.8 million were used to fund the acquisitions we completed in July and August 2002, and to purchase outstanding senior notes. On November 6, 2002, 35 Table of Contents Chesapeake closed a private offering of an additional $50 million principal amount of 9.0% senior notes due 2012. The net proceeds from the offering of $51.3 million were used to purchase outstanding 7.875% senior notes and to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility. The 9.0% senior notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our other outstanding senior notes and are subject to covenants substantially similar to those contained in the indenture for our 8.375% senior notes. On September 20, 2002, our board of directors declared a $0.03 per share dividend on the companys common stock which was paid in October 2002. Chesapeake has not paid a dividend on its common stock since 1998. The annualized cost of the common stock dividend will be about $23 million. In December 2002, we closed a private offering of $150 million principal amount of 7.75% senior notes due 2015. The net proceeds from this issuance of $145.3 million were used to fund a portion of the acquisition of oil and gas properties from ONEOK, Inc. in January 2003. The 7.75% senior notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our other outstanding senior notes and are subject to covenants substantially similar to those contained in the indentures for our 8.375% and 9.0% senior notes. In December 2002, we issued 23,000,000 shares of Chesapeake common stock at $7.50 per share. The net proceeds from the offering of $164.1 million were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of oil and gas properties from ONEOK, Inc. in January 2003. These shares were issued under the shelf registration statement filed in July 2002. Contingencies Recently, royalty owners have commenced litigation against a number of oil and gas producers claiming that amounts paid for production attributable to the royalty owners interest violated the terms of applicable leases and state law, that deductions from the proceeds of oil and gas production were unauthorized under the leases, and that amounts received by upstream sellers should be used to compute the amounts paid to the royalty owners. Typically this litigation has taken the form of class action suits. There are presently four such suits filed against Chesapeake, two in Texas and two in Oklahoma. No class has been certified in any of them. In one of the Oklahoma cases, we determined that a portion of the marketing fee we had charged royalty owners should be refunded. In late 2002, we deposited with the court the aggregate amount of the fees we estimated should be refunded, $3.3 million, in an interest bearing account for distribution to affected royalty owners. This was charged to general and administrative expenses. We do not believe any other claims made by royalty owners in the cases pending against us are valid. Even if the claims were upheld, we believe any damages awarded would not be material. This is a developing area of the law, however, and as new cases are decided, our potential liability relating to the marketing of oil and gas may increase or decrease. We will continue to monitor court decisions to ensure that our operations and practices minimize any exposure and to recognize any charges that may be appropriate when we can reasonably estimate a liability. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below. The companys management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the companys board of directors. The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. Hedging. From time to time, Chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates. Recognized gains 36 Table of Contents and losses on hedge contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results of oil and gas hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales, and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are initially reported in the consolidated statement of operations as risk management income (loss). All amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within the same caption and included in oil and gas sales or interest expense, as applicable, over the respective contract terms. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivatives gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized as an increase or decrease to the value of the hedged item until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in earnings. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the SFAS 133 definition of a cash flow or fair value hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income. See Hedging Activities below and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. One of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives. We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These values are based upon, among other things, futures prices, volatility, time to maturity and credit risk. The values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis. This correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices, the primary risk we hedge, have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively. The factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates, the companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of $45 million and an asset of $157 million, respectively. Risk management income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was a loss of $88 million and a gain of $85 million, respectively. With respect to our derivatives held as of December 31, 2002, an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of $.25 per mmbtu would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $15.6 million. An increase or decrease in crude oil prices of $1.00 per barrel would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $3.5 million. 37 Table of Contents Oil and Gas Properties. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Under the successful efforts method, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis. Additionally, gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method. As a result, our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization rate. Capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 73% of our present value (discounted at 10%) of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves was evaluated by independent petroleum engineers, with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers. In addition, our internal engineers reevaluate our reserves on a quarterly basis. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is based on the amount of estimated reserves. If we maintain the same level of production year over year, the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense will be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly. Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. We review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. The two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices, and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or a decline in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increases the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. In addition, the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period. Price increases directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues. Such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the impact of revisions to reserve estimates can have a significant impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations. From January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1998, we recorded ceiling test impairments of approximately $1.2 billion to our oil and gas 38 Table of Contents properties largely as a result of lower commodity prices. In addition, our oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization rates have fluctuated between $0.71 per mcfe in 1999 to $1.28 in 2002 reflecting the impact of prices during these periods. As of December 31, 2002, a decrease in natural gas prices of $0.10 per mcf and a decrease in oil prices of $1.00 per barrel would reduce the companys estimated proved reserves of 2,205 bcfe by 3.0 bcfe and 0.8 bcfe, respectively, and would also reduce the companys present value of estimated future net revenues by approximately $99 million and $19 million, respectively. Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which Chesapeake operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as derivative instruments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. These differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent Chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations. Under SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are: taxable income projections in future years, whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits, future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures, and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. Beginning in 1997 and continuing throughout 1998, we recorded various asset write downs related to the impairment of our oil and gas properties. The write downs and significant tax net operating loss carryforwards (caused primarily by expensing intangible drilling costs for tax purposes) resulted in a net deferred tax asset. From June 1997 through September 2000, management believed that it was more likely than not that the company would continue generating future tax net operating losses for the foreseeable future and consequently recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset. In the fourth quarter of 2000, we eliminated our existing valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a $265.0 million income tax benefit. Based upon results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 and anticipated improvement in Chesapeakes outlook for sustained profitability, we believed that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits associated with our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration. Aside from a small valuation allowance related to net operating losses generated in Louisiana, we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits associated with our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration. If (a) natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels (and if such decreases were considered other than temporary), (b) exploration, drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels, or (c) we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, we may be required to provide a valuation 39 Table of Contents allowance against our deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2002 we have a deferred tax asset of $278.5 million, of which only $2.4 million had an associated valuation allowance. Accounting for Business Combinations. Beginning in 1998, we have completed several business combinations. In the future, we may continue to grow our business through similar transactions. Prior to the issuance of SFAS 141, Accounting for Business Combinations, in 2001, we applied the guidance provided by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 16, and its interpretations, as well as various other authoritative literature and interpretations that address issues encountered in accounting for business combinations. We have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method, which is the only method permitted under SFAS 141. The accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment. Under the purchase method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given, whether in the form of cash, assets, stock or the assumption of liabilities. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values, and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, if any, over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity, if any, is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain of the acquired assets. Determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment, since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable. Different techniques may be used to determine fair values, including market prices, where available, appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows, among others. Since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment, they can change as new information becomes available. Each of the business combinations completed during the past five years were of small to medium sized exploration and production companies with oil and gas interests primarily in the Mid Continent. We believe that the consideration we have paid to acquire these companies has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of acquisition. Consequently, we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations, nor do we expect to recognize any goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future. Hedging Activities Oil and Gas Hedging Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2002, our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, cap swaps and basis protection swaps. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. For swap instruments, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price, as defined in each instrument, to the counterparty. The fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. For cap swaps, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterpartys exposure. 40 Table of Contents Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential of oil and gas from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. From time to time, we close certain swap and cap swap transactions designed to hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production by entering into a counter swap instrument. Under the counter swap we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty. To the extent the counter swap, which does not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, is designed to lock the value of an existing SFAS 133 cash flow hedge, the net value of the swap and the counter swap is frozen and shown as a derivative receivable or payable in the consolidated balance sheets. At the same time, the original swap is designated as a non qualifying cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. The net receivable or payable is frozen until the related month of production and is then recognized as an increase or decrease to revenues. Changes in fair value occurring after the original swap has been designated as a non qualifying cash flow hedge under SFAS 133 are included in results of operations. To the extent the counter swap is designed to lock the value of a non qualifying cash flow hedge under SFAS 133, the value of the counter swap is shown as a derivative asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet and referred to below as a fixed price counter swap. Any changes in the fair value of the counter swap are included in results of operations. Pursuant to SFAS 133, our cap swaps, counter swaps and basis protection swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity, together with any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges resulting from ineffectiveness, are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as risk management income (loss). Amounts recorded in risk management income (loss) do not represent cash gains or losses. Rather, these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive SFAS 133 cash flow hedge accounting treatment. All amounts initially recorded in this caption related to commodity derivatives are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms. The estimated fair values of our oil and gas derivative instruments as of December 31, 2002 are provided below.

All transactions hedged as of December 31, 2002 are expected to mature by December 31, 2003, with the exception of the basis protection swaps which extend to 2009. 41 Table of Contents Additional information concerning the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is as follows: December 31, 2002 2001 ($ in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding, beginning of year $ 157,309 $ (89,288 ) Change in fair value of contracts during period (52,419 ) 351,989 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (96,046 ) (105,392 ) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period (45,603 ) Fair value of contracts when closed during the period 22,226 Fair value of contracts outstanding, end of year $ (14,533 ) $ 157,309 Risk management income (loss) related to our oil and gas derivatives is comprised of the following: December 31, 2002 2001 ($ in thousands) Risk management income (loss): Change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting $ (23,979 ) $ 106,825 Reclassification of gain on settled contracts (59,729 ) (24,540 ) Ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting (3,559 ) 2,504 Total $ (87,267 ) $ 84,789 Interest Rate Hedging We also utilize hedging strategies to manage interest rate exposure. Results from interest rate hedging transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the derivative agreement. In March 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. The terms of this swap agreement are as follows: Term Notional Amount  Fixed Rate  Floating Rate March 2002 March 2004 $200,000,000 7.875% U.S. six month LIBOR in arrears plus 298.25 basis points At the inception of the interest rate swap agreement, a portion of the interest rate swap was to convert $129.0 million of our 7.875% senior notes from fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. Under SFAS 133, a hedge of interest rate risk in a recognized fixed rate liability can be designated as a fair value hedge. The mark to market value of the swap is therefore recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability with a corresponding increase or decrease in the carrying value of the debt. During 2002, $107.9 million face value of the 7.875% senior notes was purchased and subsequently retired. In connection with the repurchase of the 7.875% senior notes, interest rate swap hedging gains of $1.7 million were recognized and reduced the loss on repurchases of debt. In July 2002, we closed the above interest rate swap for a gain of $7.5 million. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining balance to be amortized as a reduction to interest expense was $2.6 million. During 2002, $3.2 million was recognized as a reduction to interest expense. 42 Table of Contents In June 2002, we entered into an additional interest rate swap. The terms of this swap agreement are as follows: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate July 2002 July 2004 $100,000,000 4.000% U.S. six month LIBOR in arrears In July 2002, we closed this interest rate swap for a gain of $1.1 million. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining balance to be amortized as a reduction to interest expenses was $0.9 million. During 2002, $0.2 million was recognized as a reduction to interest expense. In April 2002, we entered into a swaption agreement in order to monetize the embedded call option in the remaining $142.7 million of our 8.5% senior notes. We received approximately $7.8 million from the counterparty at the time we entered into this agreement. The terms of the swaption are as follows: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate March 2004 March 2012 $142,665,000 8.500% U.S. six month LIBOR plus 75 basis points Under the terms of the swaption agreement, the counterparty will have the option to initiate an interest rate swap on March 11, 2004 pursuant to the terms shown above. If the counterparty chooses to initiate the interest rate swap, the payments under the swap will coincide with the semi annual interest payments on our 8.5% senior notes which are paid on September 15 and March 15 of each year. On each payment date, if the fixed rate exceeds the floating rate, we will pay the counterparty and if the floating rate exceeds the fixed rate, the counterparty will pay us accordingly. If the counterparty does not choose to initiate the interest rate swap, the swaption agreement will expire and no future obligations will exist for either party. Under SFAS 133, a fair value hedge relationship exists between the embedded call option in the 8.5% senior notes and the swaption agreement. Accordingly, the mark to market value of the swaption is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability with a corresponding increase or decrease to the debts carrying value. Any change in the fair value of the swaption resulting from ineffectiveness is recorded currently in the consolidated statements of operations as risk management income (loss). We have recorded a decrease in the carrying value of the debt of $18.8 million during 2002 related to the swaption as of December 31, 2002. Of this amount, $22.3 million represents a decline in the fair value of the swaption, offset by a loss of $3.5 million from estimated ineffectiveness of the swaption as determined under SFAS 133. See Note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for the adjustments made to the carrying value of the debt at December 31, 2002. Results of the interest rate swap, if initiated, will be reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the swaption agreement. Risk management income (loss) related to our fair value hedges is comprised of the following: 2002 ($ in thousands) Risk management income (loss): Change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying for fair value hedge accounting $ 4,593 Reclassification of gain on settled contracts to interest expense (1,844 ) Ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for fair value hedge accounting (3,500 ) Total $ (751 ) 43 Table of Contents Disclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related Parties Since Chesapeake was founded in 1989, our chief executive officer and chief operating officer have acquired small working interests in certain of our oil and gas properties by participating in our drilling activities. As of December 31, 2002, we had accrued accounts receivable from our CEO and COO of $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, representing their December 2002 joint interest billings which were billed on January 15, 2003 and paid on January 16, 2003. Under their employment agreements, the CEO and COO are permitted to participate in all, or none, of the wells spudded by or on behalf of Chesapeake during each calendar quarter, but they are not allowed to only participate in selected wells. A participation election is required to be received by the Compensation Committee of Chesapeakes board of directors 30 days prior to the start of a quarter. Their participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in their employment agreements, which, among other things, limit their individual participation to a maximum working interest of 2.5% in a well and prohibits participation in situations where Chesapeakes working interest would be reduced below 12.5% as a result of their participation. In October 2001, we sold Chesapeake Canada Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary, for net proceeds of approximately $143.0 million. Our CEO and COO each received $2.0 million related to their fractional ownership interest in these Canadian assets, which they acquired and paid for pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements. The portion of the proceeds allocated to our CEO and COO was based upon the estimated fair values of the assets sold as determined by management and the independent members of our board of directors using a methodology similar to that used by Chesapeake for acquisitions of assets from disinterested third parties. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, we paid legal fees of $600,000, $391,000, and $439,000, respectively, for legal services provided by a law firm of which a director is a member. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards or SFAS Nos. 141 and 142. SFAS 141, Business Combinations, requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach and was effective in January 2002. We have adopted these new standards, which have not had a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 and establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long term assets (mainly plugging and abandonment costs for depleted wells) in the period in which the liability is incurred (at the time the wells are drilled). Accordingly, we adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2003. We expect the effect on our financial condition and results of operations at adoption will include an increase in liabilities of approximately $39 million and a cumulative effect for the change in accounting principle as a charge against earnings of approximately $10 million (net of income taxes). Subsequent to adoption, we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS 144 was effective January 1, 2002. This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 30 for the accounting and reporting of discontinued operations, as it relates to long lived assets. Our adoption of SFAS 144 did not affect our financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS 145 is effective for fiscal years 44 Table of Contents beginning after May 15, 2002. We have adopted this standard early and it did not have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting For Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. On December 31, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure An Amendment of SFAS 123. The standard provides additional transition guidance for companies that elect to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 148 does not change the provisions of SFAS 123 that permit entities to continue to apply the intrinsic value method of APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. As we continue to follow APB 25, our accounting for stock based compensation will not change as a result of SFAS 148. SFAS 148 does require certain new disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements. The required annual disclosures are effective immediately and have been included in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. The new interim disclosure provisions will be effective in the first quarter of 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation, or FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantee of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. FIN 45s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The guarantors previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of FIN 45s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after December 15, 2002. Chesapeake is not a guarantor under any significant guarantees and thus this interpretation is not expected to have a significant effect on the companys financial position or results of operations. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, An Interpretation of ARB 51. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide guidance on how to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights (variable interest entities or VIEs) and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE. This new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either (1) the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include statements regarding oil and gas reserve estimates, planned capital expenditures, the drilling of oil and gas wells and future acquisitions, expected oil and gas production, cash flow and anticipated liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations, expected future expenses and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. Statements concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Item 1 and include: the volatility of oil and gas prices, our substantial indebtedness, 45 Table of Contents the strength and financial resources of our competitors, the cost and availability of drilling and production services, our commodity price risk management activities, including counterparty contract performance risk, uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves, projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures, our ability to replace reserves, the availability of capital, uncertainties in evaluating oil and gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities, declines in the values of our oil and gas properties resulting in ceiling test write downs, drilling and operating risks, our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize our NOLs before expiration, future ownership changes which could result in additional limitations to our NOLs, adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, losses possible from pending or future litigation, and the loss of officers or key employees. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Oil and Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2002, our derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, cap swaps, and basis protection swaps. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. For swap instruments, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price, as defined in each instrument, to the counterparty. The fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. For cap swaps, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterpartys exposure. Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential of oil and gas from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. 46 Table of Contents From time to time, we close certain swap and cap swap transactions designed to hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production by entering into a counter swap instrument. Under the counter swap we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty. To the extent the counter swap, which does not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, is designed to lock the value of an existing SFAS 133 cash flow hedge, the net value of the swap and the counter swap is frozen and shown as a derivative receivable or payable in the consolidated balance sheets. At the same time, the original swap is designated as a non qualifying cash flow hedge under SFAS 133. The net receivable or payable is frozen until the related month of production and is then recognized as an increase or decrease to revenues. Changes in fair value occurring after the original swap has been designated as a non qualifying cash flow hedge under SFAS 133 are included in results of operations. To the extent the counter swap is designed to lock the value of a non qualifying cash flow hedge under SFAS 133, the value of the counter swap is shown as a derivative asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet and referred to below as a fixed price counter swap. Any changes in the fair value of the counter swap are included in results of operations. Pursuant to SFAS 133, our cap swaps, counter swaps and basis protection swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity, together with any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges resulting from ineffectiveness, are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as risk management income (loss). Amounts recorded in risk management income (loss) do not represent cash gains or losses. Rather, these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive SFAS 133 cash flow hedge accounting treatment. All amounts initially recorded in this caption related to commodity derivatives are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms. 47 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2002, we had the following open oil and gas derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of our oil and gas production for periods after December 2002: Volume Average Strike Price Weighted Average Put Strike Price Weighted Average Differential to Mid Continent Points SFAS 133 Hedge Fair Value at December 31, 2002 ($ in thousands) Natural Gas (mmbtu): Swaps: 2003 57,150,000 4.31 Yes (21,523 ) Cap Swaps: 2003 51,100,000 3.60 2.60 No (50,732 ) Basis Protection Swaps: 2003 91,250,000 (0.15 ) No 5,562 2004 91,500,000 (0.15 ) No 1,925 2005 98,550,000 (0.16 ) No 476 2006 36,500,000 (0.16 ) No 120 2007 45,625,000 (0.16 ) No 96 2008 45,750,000 (0.16 ) No 34 2009 36,500,000 (0.16 ) No 14 Counter Swaps: 2003 45,700,000 3.74 No 37,048 Locked Swaps: 2003 No 16,498 Total Gas (10,482 ) Oil (bbls): Swaps: 2003 360,000 25.10 Yes (1,799 ) Cap Swaps: 2003 3,015,000 28.10 No (2,252 ) Total Oil (4,051 ) Total Gas and Oil $ (14,533 ) We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates of fair value reported by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. The actual contribution to our future results of operations will be based on the market prices at the time of settlement and may be more or less than the fair value estimates used at December 31, 2002. Additional information concerning the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is as follows: December 31, 2002 2001 ($ in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding beginning of year $ 157,309 $ (89,288 ) Change in fair value of contracts during period (52,419 ) 351,989 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period (96,046 ) (105,392 ) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period (45,603 ) Fair value of contracts when closed during the period 22,226 Fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year $ (14,533 ) $ 157,309 48 Table of Contents Risk management income (loss) related to our oil and gas derivatives is comprised of the following: December 31, 2002 2001 ($ in thousands) Risk management income (loss): Change in fair value of derivatives note qualifying for hedge accounting $ (23,979 ) $ 106,825 Reclassification of gain on settled contracts (59,729 ) (24,540 ) Ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting (3,559 ) 2,504 Total $ (87,267 ) $ 84,789 The change in the fair value of our derivative instruments since January 1, 2002 resulted from an increase in market prices for natural gas and crude oil. Derivative instruments reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for oil and gas as of the consolidated balance sheet date. The derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2002, we expect to transfer approximately $4.1 million of loss included in the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12 months when the transactions actually occur. All transactions hedged as of December 31, 2002 are expected to mature by December 31, 2003, with the exception of the basis protection swaps which extend to 2009. Interest Rate Hedging We also utilize hedging strategies to manage interest rate exposure. Results from interest rate hedging transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the derivative agreement. In March 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. The terms of this swap agreement are as follows: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate March 2002 March 2004 $200,000,000 7.875% U.S. six month LIBOR in arrears plus 298.25 basis points At the inception of the interest rate swap agreement, a portion of the interest rate swap was entered into to convert $129.0 million of our 7.875% senior notes from fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. Under SFAS 133, a hedge of interest rate risk in a recognized fixed rate liability can be designated as a fair value hedge. The mark to market value of the swap is therefore recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability with a corresponding increase or decrease in the carrying value of the debt. During 2002, $107.9 million face value of the 7.875% senior notes was purchased and subsequently retired. In connection with the repurchase of the 7.875% senior notes, interest rate swap hedging gains of $1.7 million were recognized in 2002, and reduce the loss on repurchases of debt. In July 2002, we closed the above interest rate swap for a gain of $7.5 million. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining balance to be amortized as a reduction to interest expense was $2.6 million. During 2002, $3.2 million was recognized as a reduction to interest expense. 49 Table of Contents In June 2002, we entered into an additional interest rate swap. The terms of this swap agreement are as follows: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate July 2002 July 2004 $100,000,000 4.000% U.S. six month LIBOR in arrears In July 2002, we closed this interest rate swap for a gain of $1.1 million. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining balance to amortize as a reduction to interest expense was $0.9 million. During 2002, $0.2 million was recognized as a reduction to interest expense. In April 2002, we entered into a swaption agreement in order to monetize the embedded call option in the remaining $142.7 million of our 8.5% senior notes. We received $7.8 million from the counterparty at the time we entered into this agreement. The terms of the swaption are as follows: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate March 2004 March 2012 $142,665,000 8.500% U.S. six month LIBOR plus 75 basis points Under the terms of the swaption agreement, the counterparty will have the option to initiate an interest rate swap on March 11, 2004 pursuant to the terms shown above. If the counterparty chooses to initiate the interest rate swap, the payments under the swap will coincide with the semi annual interest payments on our 8.5% senior notes which are paid on September 15 and March 15 of each year. On each payment date, if the fixed rate exceeds the floating rate, we will pay the counterparty and if the floating rate exceeds the fixed rate, the counterparty will pay us accordingly. If the counterparty does not choose to initiate the interest rate swap, the swaption agreement will expire and no future obligations will exist for either party. According to SFAS 133, a fair value hedge relationship exists between the embedded call option in the 8.5% senior notes and our swaption agreement. Accordingly, the mark to market value of the swaption is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability with a corresponding increase or decrease to the debts carrying value. Any change in the fair value of the swaption resulting from ineffectiveness is recorded currently in the consolidated statements of operations as risk management income (loss). We have recorded a decrease in the carrying value of the debt of $18.8 million during 2002 related to the swaption as of December 31, 2002. Of this amount, $22.3 million represents a decline in the fair value of the swaption, offset by a loss of $3.5 million from estimated ineffectiveness of the swaption as determined under SFAS 133. See Note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for the adjustments made to the carrying value of the debt at December 31, 2002. Results of the interest rate swap, if initiated, will be reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the swaption agreement. Risk management income (loss) related to our fair value hedges is comprised of the following ($ in thousands): 2002 ($ in thousands) Risk management income (loss): Change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying for fair value hedge accounting $ 4,593 Reclassification of gain on settled contracts to interest expense (1,844 ) Ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for fair value hedge accounting (3,500 ) Total $ (751 ) 50 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. The fair value of the fixed rate long term debt has been estimated based on quoted market prices.

Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility. All of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and therefore does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt. 51 Table of Contents
