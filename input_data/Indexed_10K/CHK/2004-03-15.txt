Our primary operating area is the Mid Continent region of the United States, which includes Oklahoma, western Arkansas, southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle. We are building secondary operating areas in the Permian Basin of western Texas and eastern New Mexico and in the South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast regions. The Company has achieved its current position as a result of a series of key management decisions made during the past six years. These decisions included favoring gas over oil, establishing regional dominance in our operating areas, delivering value added growth through a balance of drilling and acquisitions and managing risk through opportunistic oil and natural gas hedging. Oil and natural gas production for 2003 was 268 bcfe, an increase of 87 bcfe, or 48%, over the 181 bcfe produced in 2002. Of this 87 bcfe in year over year production growth, an estimated 36 bcfe was a result of organic drillbit growth while 51 bcfe was generated from acquisitions. We estimate our organic growth rate during 2003 was 20%, well above the companys forecasted organic growth rate of 5%. We have increased our production annually for 14 consecutive years, which we believe is one of the best track records in the industry. In addition, the 2003 fourth quarter was Chesapeakes tenth consecutive quarter of sequential production growth. During the past ten quarters, Chesapeakes production has increased 87%, for an average sequential quarterly growth rate of 6.5% and an annualized growth rate of 28.1% Chesapeake began 2003 with estimated proved reserves of 2,205 bcfe and ended the year with 3,169 bcfe, an increase of 964 bcfe, or 44%. Taking into account production of 268 bcfe, reserve replacement during the year was 1,232 bcfe, or 459%, at a finding and acquisition cost of $1.36 per mcfe. Our year end 2003 proved reserves were 74% proved developed. Independent third party reservoir engineers evaluated 74% of our estimated proved reserves at year end 2003. Of the 1,232 bcfe of proved reserve additions, acquisitions added 805 bcfe at a cost of $1.38 per mcfe and drilling, including positive revisions to previous estimates, added 438 bcfe for a reserve replacement rate from drilling of 163% at a cost of $1.32 per mcfe. Additionally, we continued to invest in our future in 2003. We made unproved property purchases of $198 million and incurred geological and geophysical expenditures of $38 million and lease acquisition expenditures of $85 million. During 2003, Chesapeake drilled 442 (352 net) operated wells and participated in another 641 (104 net) wells operated by other companies. Chesapeakes drilling costs were $438 million for operated wells and $140 million for non operated wells. The companys success rate was 96% for operated wells and 95% for non operated wells. Chesapeake has an active property consolidation program that is focused on corporate and property acquisitions of up to $500 million. During 2003, we acquired approximately 805 bcfe of proved reserves for a total cost of $1.1 billion (primarily in nine transactions of more than $10 million each). Pro forma for two large acquisitions completed in January 2004, we spent $1.7 billion to acquire 1,102 bcfe of proved reserves in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, Chesapeakes estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10% before taxes (PV 10) were $7.33 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $30.22 per bo (based on a NYMEX year end price of $32.47 per bo) and $5.68 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year end price of $5.97 per mcf). PV 10 as of December 31, 2002 was $3.72 billion using field differential adjusted prices of $30.18 per bo (based on a NYMEX year end price of $31.25 per bo) and $4.28 per mcf (based on a NYMEX year end price of $4.60 per mcf). Pro forma for acquisitions completed in January 2004, our proved reserves at year end 2003 were 3,474 bcfe and had a PV 10 value of $7.9 billion. Chesapeake continues to focus on improving the strength of its balance sheet. At the beginning of the year, the companys total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total capitalization is the sum of total debt and 28 stockholders equity) was 65% and debt per proved mcfe was $0.75 per mcfe. By year end 2003 (pro forma for the reserves acquired in January 2004 and the related financings and debt exchanges completed in January 2004), the companys debt as a percentage of total capitalization had decreased to 53% and debt per proved mcfe had decreased to $0.65 per mcfe, reductions of 18% and 13%, respectively. Key goals of management are to reduce debt to below 50% of total capitalization and debt per mcfe of proved reserves to below $0.60. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity and Uses of Funds Our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures (other than for large acquisitions) is cash flow from operations in 2004. Based on our current production, price and expense assumptions, we expect cash flow from operations will exceed our drilling capital expenditures. Our budget for drilling, land and seismic activities during 2004 is currently between $750 million and $800 million. While we believe this level of exploration and development will be sufficient to increase our reserves in 2004 and achieve our target of a 20% increase in production over 2003 production (inclusive of acquisitions completed in January 2004), higher drilling and field operating costs, drilling results that alter planned development schedules, acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program, which is largely discretionary. Any cash flow from operations not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions, debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in 2004. Cash provided by operating activities (exclusive of changes in assets and liabilities) was $903.9 million in 2003, compared to $412.5 million in 2002 and $518.6 million in 2001. The $491.4 million increase from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and gas production. The $106.1 million decrease from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to decreased oil and gas revenues resulting from lower prices partially offset by higher volumes produced. We expect that 2004 production volumes will be higher than in 2003 and that cash provided by operating activities in 2004 will exceed 2003 levels. While a precipitous decline in gas prices in 2004 would significantly affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations, we have 78% of our expected oil production in 2004 hedged at an average NYMEX price of $28.68 per barrel of oil and 69% of our expected natural gas production in 2004 hedged at an average NYMEX price of $5.32 per mcf. This level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a substantial portion of our 2004 production. Depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and managements view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, however, we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions. Another source of liquidity is our $350 million revolving bank credit facility (with a committed borrowing base of $350 million) which matures in May 2007. At March 10, 2004, we had $150 million of indebtedness under the bank credit facility. We use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed. We borrowed and repaid $738.0 million in 2003 and $252.5 million in 2002, and we borrowed $433.5 million and repaid $458.5 million in 2001 under the facility. We incurred $2.5 million, $2.9 million and $6.6 million of financing costs related to the credit facility in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, as a result of amendments to the credit facility agreement. We believe that our available cash, cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating, interest and general and administrative expenses, our capital expenditure budget, our short term contractual obligations and dividend payments at current levels for the foreseeable future. The public markets have been our principal source of capital to finance large acquisitions. We have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past, and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions. Nevertheless, we caution you that ready access to 29 capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties, as explained under Risk Factors in Item 1 Business. The following table reflects the proceeds from sales of securities we issued in 2003, 2002 and 2001($ in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Total Proceeds Net Proceeds Total Proceeds Net Proceeds Total Proceeds Net Proceeds Unsecured senior notes guaranteed by subsidiaries $ 500.0 $ 485.4 $ 450.0 $ 439.4 $ 1,050.0 $ 1,028.3 Convertible preferred stock 402.5 390.4 150.0 145.1 Common stock 186.3 177.4 172.5 164.1 Total $ 1,088.8 $ 1,053.2 $ 622.5 $ 603.5 $ 1,200.0 $ 1,173.4 We used $27.3 million and $5.0 million to pay common stock dividends in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and we paid dividends of $20.9 million, $10.2 million and $1.1 million on our preferred stock in 2003, 2002 and 2001. We received $9.3 million, $3.8 million and $3.2 million from the exercise of employee and director stock options in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We used $2.1 million to purchase treasury stock in 2003 to fund our matching contributions to the 401(k) Make Up Plan. Historically, we have used significant amounts of funds to purchase and retire outstanding company senior notes. In 2003, we purchased and subsequently retired $106.4 million of our 8.5% senior notes for $113.1 million, including redemption premium of $6.7 million. In 2002, we purchased and subsequently retired $107.9 million of our 7.875% senior notes for $111.6 million, including redemption premium of $3.7 million. In 2001, we used $906.0 million to purchase or redeem various Chesapeake and Gothic senior notes. We paid $3.3 million for make whole provisions in the fourth quarter 2001 related to the exchange of our common stock for RAM Energy, Inc. common stock which occurred in March 2001. Cash used in investing activities increased to $2,077.2 million in 2003, compared to $779.7 million in 2002 and $670.1 million in 2001. The following table shows our capital expenditures during these years ($ in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Exploration and development drilling $ 727.2 $ 400.2 $ 421.0 Acquisitions of oil and gas properties and companies 1,261.3 331.7 316.7 Deposit for pending acquisitions 13.3 15.0 Investment in securities of other companies 30.8 2.4 40.2 Drilling rigs, plants and gathering systems 23.3 6.6 15.9 Office buildings and other administrative 49.4 30.6 23.1 Total $ 2,105.3 $ 786.5 $ 816.9 Through divestitures of oil and gas properties, we received $22.2 million in 2003, $0.8 million in 2002 and $144.3 million, including $142.9 million for the sale of our Canadian subsidiary, in 2001. Sales of other assets and recoveries of investments in securities of other companies provided $5.8 million, $5.8 million and $3.2 million of cash in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During 2003 and early 2004, we took several steps to improve our capital structure, including the transactions described below under Investing and Financing Transactions. These transactions enabled us to extend our average maturity of long term debt to over nine years with an average interest rate of 7.7%. The companys debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased to 53% (pro forma for January and February 2004 securities transactions) and debt per proved mcfe decreased to $0.65 per mcfe. Reducing debt to below 50% of total capitalization and reducing debt per mcfe of proved reserves to below $0.60 are key goals of our business strategy. 30 Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas ($173.8 million at December 31, 2003) and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate ($37.8 million at December 31, 2003). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. Our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements, such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities. We have not relied on off balance sheet financing arrangements in the past and we do not intend to rely on such arrangements in the future as a source of liquidity. We are not a commercial paper issuer. Investing and Financing Transactions The following describes significant investing and financing transactions that we completed in 2003 and in January and February 2004: Investing Transactions: First Quarter 2003 Mid Continent properties from a wholly owned subsidiary of ONEOK, Inc.: cash consideration of $296 million of which $15 million was paid in 2002 Anadarko Basin properties in western Oklahoma and Texas Panhandle from El Paso Corporation: cash consideration of approximately $500 million Bray Field properties in southern Oklahoma from Vintage Petroleum, Inc.: cash consideration of approximately $29 million 5.3 million shares, or approximately 25%, of Pioneer Drilling Company common stock: $20 million Second Quarter 2003 Oxley Petroleum Company, Arkoma Basin properties in eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas: cash consideration of approximately $155 million Third Quarter 2003 Beckham County, Oklahoma producing properties, gas gathering system and gas treatment plant: cash consideration of approximately $44.5 million 25% limited partnership interest in Eagle Energy Partnership I, L.P., a gas marketing company: $5.8 million Fourth Quarter 2003 20% limited partnership interest in Texas Vicksburg Holding L.P., which conducts E&P operations through several partnerships: $5.0 million South Texas properties from Laredo Energy, L.P. and its partners: cash consideration of approximately $200 million Permian Basin properties: cash consideration of $23 million January 2004 Concho Resources Inc., Permian Basin and Mid Continent properties: cash consideration of approximately $420 million of which $10 million was paid in 2003 South Texas properties: cash consideration of approximately $65 million of which $3.3 million was paid in 2003 31 Financing Transactions: First Quarter 2003 Private placement of $300 million 7.5% senior notes due 2013 Public offering of 23 million shares of common stock at $8.10 per share Private placement of $230 million of 6.0% cumulative convertible preferred stock Third Quarter 2003 Privately negotiated exchange of $63.0 million of 7.75% senior notes due 2015 and accrued interest of $0.1 million for $27.9 million of 8.375% senior notes due 2008 and accrued interest of $0.5 million and $32.0 million of 8.5% senior notes due 2012 and accrued interest of $1.1 million Fourth Quarter 2003 Privately negotiated exchange of $23.7 million of 7.75% senior notes due 2015 and accrued interest of $0.4 million for $6.0 million of 8.375% senior notes due 2008 and accrued interest of $0.2 million and $16.8 million of 8.125% senior notes due 2011 Privately negotiated exchange of $63.8 million of 7.5% senior notes due 2013 and accrued interest of $0.4 million for $54.9 million of 8.125% senior notes due 2011 and accrued interest of $0.2 million and $6.3 million of 8.375% senior notes due 2008 and accrued interest of $0.2 million Private placement of $200 million 6.875% senior notes due 2016 Public offering of 1,725,000 shares of 5.0% convertible preferred stock at $100 per share Paid $113.1 million (including premium of $6.7 million) for $106.4 million of 8.5% senior notes due 2012 pursuant to cash tender offer January and February 2004 Public offering of 23 million shares of common stock at $13.51 per share Public exchange of $72.8 million of 7.75% senior notes due 2015 and accrued interest of $2.8 million and additional $433.5 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2016 and accrued interest of $4.1 million for $458.5 million of 8.125% senior notes due 2011 and accrued interest of $10.8 million Privately negotiated exchanges of $37.0 million of 6.875% senior notes due 2016 and accrued interest of $0.5 million for $24.3 million of 8.125% senior notes due 2011 and accrued interest of $0.7 million and $9.1 million of 7.75% senior notes due 2015 and accrued interest of $0.1 million Contractual Obligations We have a $350 million revolving bank credit facility (with a committed borrowing base of $350 million) which matures in May 2007. As of December 31, 2003, we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized $35.8 million of the facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank of California, N.A., or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (ii) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our option, plus a margin that varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt rating. The collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee of 0.375%. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell properties, pay dividends, purchase or redeem our capital stock, make 32 investments or loans or purchase certain of our senior notes, and create liens. The credit facility agreement requires us to maintain a current ratio (as defined) of at least 1 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined) of at least 2.5 to 1. At December 31, 2003, our current ratio was 1.6 to 1 and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.8 to 1. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $25.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, senior notes represented approximately $2.1 billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following ($ in thousands): 7.875% senior notes due 2004(a) $ 42,137 8.375% senior notes due 2008 209,815 8.125% senior notes due 2011 728,255 9.0% senior notes due 2012 300,000 8.5% senior notes due 2012 4,290 7.5% senior notes due 2013 363,823 7.75% senior notes due 2015 236,691 6.875% senior notes due 2016 200,000 Discount on senior notes (26,959 ) Discount for interest rate swap and swaption (339 ) $ 2,057,713 (a) This amount was classified as long term debt based on our ability and intent to satisfy this obligation with funding from our bank credit facility. Following the debt exchanges which occurred in January and February 2004 and excluding the 7.875% senior notes which were paid in March 2004 and the 8.5% senior notes which were called for redemption in March 2004, our pro forma senior notes payable as of December 31, 2003 consisted of the following: 8.375% senior notes due 2008 $ 209,815 8.125% senior notes due 2011 245,407 9.0% senior notes due 2012 300,000 7.5% senior notes due 2013 363,823 7.75% senior notes due 2015 300,408 6.875% senior notes due 2016 670,487 Discount on senior notes (79,298 ) $ 2,010,642 No scheduled principal payments are required on any of the senior notes until 2008, when $209.8 million is due. Debt ratings for the senior notes are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service, BB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and BB by Fitch Ratings. Debt ratings for our secured bank credit facility are Ba2 by Moodys Investor Service, BBB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services and BB+ by Fitch Ratings. Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness. All of our wholly owned subsidiaries except Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., Mayfield Processing, L.L.C. and MidCon Compression, L.P. guarantee the notes. The indentures permit us to redeem the senior notes at any time at specified make whole or redemption prices. The indentures for the 8.125%, 8.375%, 9.0%, 7.75%, 7.50% and 6.875% senior notes contain covenants limiting our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted 33 payments; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The debt incurrence covenants do not affect our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2003, we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately $1,237.3 million could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant. The indenture covenants do not apply to our marketing subsidiaries, Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., Mayfield Processing, L.L.C. and MidCon Compression, L.P., which are our only unrestricted subsidiaries. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 ($ in thousands): Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Long term debt obligations $ 2,085,011 $ 42,137 $ $ 209,815 $ 1,833,059 Capital lease obligations Operating lease obligations 5,437 2,353 2,169 500 415 Purchase obligations Standby letters of credit 36,358 36,358 Other long term obligations 1,738 1,496 242 Total contractual cash obligations $ 2,128,544 $ 82,344 $ 2,411 $ 210,315 $ 1,833,474 Some of our commodity price and financial risk management arrangements require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations with respect to our commodity price and financial risk management transactions exceed certain levels. At December 31, 2003, we were required to post $33.5 million of collateral and at March 10, 2004, we were required to post $70.0 million of collateral. Future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties, highly volatile natural gas and oil prices, and fluctuations in interest rates. Hedging Activities Oil and Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments, including swaps, counter swaps (locking in the value of certain swaps), cap swaps, basis protection swaps and call options. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contains a description of each of these instruments. Hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and gas production. We closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss. Commodity markets are volatile, and Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic. Mark to market positions under oil and gas hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices. As described above under Contractual Obligations, we may be required to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts. Realized gains and losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas sales of $17.4 million or $0.06 per mcfe in 2003, a net increase of $96.0 million or $0.53 per mcfe in 2002 and a net increase of $105.4 million or $0.65 per mcfe in 2001. Oil and gas sales also includes changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, as well as gains (losses) on 34 ineffectiveness of instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains (losses) included in oil and gas sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $10.5 million, ($87.3) million and $84.8 million, respectively. Included in these unrealized gains (losses) are gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges of ($9.2) million in 2003, ($3.6) million in 2002 and $2.5 million in 2001. Changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities, and locked in gains and losses of derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the month of related production. These unrealized losses, net of related tax effects, totaled $20.3 million and $3.5 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2003, we expect to transfer to earnings approximately $17.6 million of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income during the next 12 months. A detailed explanation of accounting for oil and gas derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. The fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The estimated fair values of our oil and gas derivative instruments as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 are provided below: December 31, 2003 2002 ($ in thousands) Derivative assets (liabilities): Fixed price gas swaps $ (44,794 ) $ (21,523 ) Fixed price gas cap swaps (18,608 ) (50,732 ) Gas basis protection swaps 46,205 8,227 Fixed price gas counter swaps 37,048 Gas call options (17,876 ) Fixed price gas locked swaps 1,777 16,498 Fixed price crude oil swaps (1,799 ) Fixed price crude oil cap swaps (11,692 ) (2,252 ) Estimated fair value $ (44,988 ) $ (14,533 ) As of December 31, 2003, we had hedged approximately 78% of our expected oil production and 69% of our expected natural gas production in 2004. In addition, hedging contracts were in place for approximately 27% of expected natural gas production in 2005, 11% in 2006 and 8% in 2007. Natural gas basis protection swaps extend to 2009. A detailed listing of our oil and gas derivatives by year of maturity is included in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Additional information concerning changes in the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is as follows: December 31, 2003 2002 2001 ($ in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding, beginning of year $ (14,533 ) $ 157,309 $ (89,288 ) Change in fair value of contracts during the period (31,078 ) (52,419 ) 351,989 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 17,389 (96,046 ) (105,392 ) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period (16,766 ) (45,603 ) Fair value of contracts when closed during the period 22,226 Fair value of contracts outstanding, end of year $ (44,988 ) $ (14,533 ) $ 157,309 35 Interest Rate Hedging We also utilize hedging strategies to manage the exposure our fixed rate senior notes have to interest rate changes. By entering into interest rate swaps, we convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. To the extent the interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the corresponding debt are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the derivative agreement. The following describes interest rate swaps entered into during 2002 and 2003, all of which were terminated prior to contractual maturity for cash settlements ($ in thousands): DateInitiated Fair Value atDecember 31,2003 DateClosed Cash SettlementReceived GainsRecognized in2002 GainsRecognized in2003 Gains to be Recognized in2004 March 2002(a) $ July 2002 $ 7,500 $ 6,778 (c) $ 599 $ 123 June 2002(b) July 2002 1,130 1,130 August 2003(b) 870 January 2004 940 870 70 August 2003(b) 1,292 January 2004 1,370 1,292 78 (a) This instrument was designated as a fair value hedge with changes in the fair value recorded as an adjustment to the debt. Upon termination of the hedging relationship, the previously recorded changes in the fair value of the debt are amortized to earnings over the term of the debt. (b) These instruments were not designated as fair value hedges; therefore, changes in the fair value were recorded as adjustments to interest expense. (c) Of this amount, $1.7 million was recognized as a reduction to the loss on repurchases of debt upon retirement of 7.785% notes. In April 2002, Chesapeake entered into a swaption with an unrelated counterparty with respect to its 8.5% senior notes due 2012. The notional amount of the swaption was $142.7 million, which was the principal amount then outstanding under the 8.5% senior notes. The 8.5% senior notes included a call option whereby Chesapeake may redeem the debt at declining redemption prices beginning in March 2004. Under the swaption, the counterparty received the option to elect whether or not to enter into an interest rate swap with Chesapeake in March 2004, and Chesapeake received $7.8 million. The interest rate swap, if executed by the counterparty, requires Chesapeake to pay a fixed rate of 8.5% while the counterparty pays Chesapeake a floating rate of 6 month LIBOR plus 0.75%. Additionally, if the counterparty elects to enter into the interest rate swap, it may also elect to force Chesapeake to settle the transaction at the then current value of the interest rate swap. According to SFAS 133, a fair value hedge relationship exists between the embedded call option in the 8.5% senior notes and the swaption. The fair value of the swaption is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability, and the carrying amount of the debt is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the call option subsequent to the initiation of the swaption. Any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense. During the third quarter 2003, we exchanged and subsequently retired $32.0 million of our 8.5% senior notes. The exchange of debt was treated as a modification rather than an extinguishment. Accordingly, the adjustment to the carrying value of the debt of $3.3 million related to the application of hedge accounting was reflected as a discount on the notes issued in the exchange transaction and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. During the fourth quarter 2003, we purchased and subsequently retired $106.4 million of the remaining $110.7 million of 8.5% senior notes pursuant to a tender offer and recorded a $12.0 million loss related to the removal of the fair value designation of the corresponding amount of the swaption. Temporary fluctuations in the fair value of the portion of the swaption no longer designated as a fair value hedge are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. We recorded a $3.3 million unrealized loss in interest expense during 2003 due to a decline in the fair value of the portion of the swaption no longer designated as a fair value hedge. 36 As of December 31, 2003, the remaining notional amount of the swaption designated as a fair value hedge was $4.3 million. We have recorded an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt of $0.5 million which represents the temporary fluctuations in the fair value of the call option included in the $4.3 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes. Since the inception of the swaption, we have recorded a change in the fair market value of the swaption from a $7.8 million liability to a $32.6 million liability, an increase of $24.8 million. We have recorded as additional interest expense $5.6 million to reflect ineffectiveness after giving effect to the removal of the designation of a portion of the swaption as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133 as described previously. On February 27, 2004, Chesapeake and the counterparty agreed to extend the counterpartys right to require Chesapeake to settle the transaction on March 15, 2004 to April 15, 2004. On March 10, 2004, the counterparty exercised its option to enter into the interest rate swap effective March 15, 2004. On April 15, 2004 and each succeeding March 15, the counterparty may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current value of the interest rate swap. We may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current value of the interest rate swap at any time during the term of the swap. Cash payments related to the interest rate swap, if initiated, or as a result of cash settlement at termination, will be recorded as adjustments to earnings. Results of Operations General. For the year ended December 31, 2003, Chesapeake had net income of $313.0 million, or $1.21 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $1,717.4 million. This compares to net income of $40.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $738.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2002, and net income of $217.4 million, or $1.25 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $969.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. The 2003 net income includes, on a pre tax basis, a $20.8 million loss on repurchases of debt, a $6.4 million provision for legal settlements, $4.0 million in net unrealized gains on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives and a $2.0 million impairment of our investment in Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. The 2002 net income includes, on a pre tax basis, $88.0 million in net unrealized losses on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives, a $17.2 million impairment of our investment in Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. and a $2.6 million loss on repurchases of debt. The 2001 net income included, on a pre tax basis, $84.8 million in net unrealized gains on oil and gas derivatives, a $10.1 million impairment of certain equity investments, a $27.0 million gain on the sale of our Canadian subsidiary, a $3.4 million cost for an unsecured standby credit facility associated with the acquisition of Gothic Energy Corporation and a $76.7 million loss on repurchases of debt. Oil and Gas Sales. During 2003, oil and gas sales were $1,296.8 million versus $568.2 million in 2002 and $820.3 million in 2001. In 2003, Chesapeake produced 268.4 bcfe at a weighted average price of $4.79 per mcfe, compared to 181.5 bcfe produced in 2002 at a weighted average price of $3.61 per mcfe, and 161.5 bcfe produced in 2001 at a weighted average price of $4.56 per mcfe (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). The increase in prices in 2003 resulted in an increase in revenue of $317.2 million and increased production resulted in a $313.6 million increase, for a total increase in revenues of $630.8 million (excluding unrealized gains or losses on oil and gas derivatives). The change in oil and gas prices has a significant impact on our oil and gas revenues and cash flows. Assuming 2003 production levels, a change of $0.10 per mcf of gas produced would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $24.0 million and $22.6 million, respectively, and a change of $1.00 per barrel of oil produced would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately $4.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively, without considering the effect of derivative activities. For 2003, we realized an average price per barrel of oil of $25.85, compared to $25.22 in 2002 and $26.92 in 2001 (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). Natural gas prices realized per mcf (excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $4.85, $3.54 and $4.56 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Realized gains or losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas revenues of $17.4 million or $0.06 per mcfe in 2003, a net increase of $96.0 million or $0.53 per mcfe in 2002 and a net increase of $105.4 million or $0.65 per mcfe in 2001. 37 Year over year changes in oil and gas sales during the last three years were also affected by unrealized gains (losses) on oil and gas derivatives, which were $10.5 million in 2003, $(87.3) million in 2002 and $84.8 million in 2001. The following table shows our production by region for 2003, 2002 and 2001: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 mmcfe Percent mmcfe Percent mmcfe Percent Mid Continent 233,559 87.0 % 147,348 81.2 % 116,133 71.9 % South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast 23,322 8.7 23,264 12.8 27,531 17.1 Permian Basin 8,496 3.2 7,637 4.2 5,029 3.1 Williston Basin and Other 2,979 1.1 3,229 1.8 3,683 2.3 Canada 9,075 5.6 Total production 268,356 100.0 % 181,478 100.0 % 161,451 100.0 % Natural gas production represented approximately 90% of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in 2003, compared to 89% in 2002 and 89% 2001. The increase in production from 2001 through 2003 is due to the combination of organic production growth during the period as well as acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2003. Oil and Gas Marketing Sales. Chesapeake realized $420.6 million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in 2003, with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of $410.3 million, for a net margin of $10.3 million. Sales for third parties include the sale of oil and gas from wells not operated by Chesapeake, as well as the sale of oil and gas from working interest owners other than Chesapeake in wells operated by Chesapeake. This compares to sales of $170.3 million and $148.7 million, expenses of $165.7 million and $144.4 million, and margins of $4.6 million and $4.3 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2003, Chesapeake realized an increase in volumes and prices related to oil and gas marketing sales. In 2002, the increase in volume was partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas prices. Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were $137.6 million in 2003, compared to $98.2 million and $75.4 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses were $0.51 per mcfe in 2003 compared to $0.54 and $0.47 per mcfe in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in costs on a per unit basis in 2003 is due primarily to lower production costs associated with properties acquired during the year and realization of efficiencies from higher scale of operations in the Mid Continent region. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher field service costs and higher production costs associated with properties acquired during 2002. We expect that production expenses per mcfe in 2004 will range from $0.55 to $0.60. Production Taxes. Production taxes were $77.9 million in 2003 compared to $30.1 million in 2002 and $33.0 million in 2001. On a unit of production basis, production taxes were $0.29, $0.17 and $0.20 per mcfe in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 of $47.8 million was due to an increase in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas and the loss of certain Oklahoma severance tax exemptions resulting from natural gas prices exceeding a pre determined ceiling during the period. The decrease in 2002 of $2.9 million was due to a decrease in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas. In general, production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and gas prices are higher. We expect production taxes per mcfe to range from $0.28 to $0.32 in 2004 based on an assumption that oil and natural gas wellhead prices range from $4.50 to $5.00 per mcfe. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses, which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties (see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements), were $23.8 million in 2003, $17.6 million in 2002 and $14.4 million in 2001. The increase 38 in 2003 and 2002 is the result of the companys growth related to the various acquisitions which occurred in 2003 and 2002. This growth has resulted in a substantial increase in employees and related costs. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses for 2004 will be between $0.10 and $0.11 per mcfe produced, which is approximately the same level as 2003. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $35.5 million, $24.3 million and $18.2 million of internal costs in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, directly related to our oil and gas exploration and development efforts. Provision for Legal Settlements. We have entered into a settlement agreement, effective December 31, 2003, to resolve a legal proceeding brought against us by certain royalty owners. Under the terms of the settlement, we will refund Oklahoma royalty owners $10.5 million, including interest. The refund amount includes $3.6 million relating to marketing fees which we have previously paid into the court and charged to provision for legal settlements ($0.3 million in the first quarter 2003 and $3.3 million in 2002). In the third and fourth quarter 2003, we accrued an additional $6.9 million related to the settlement. A description of the settlement is included in note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements. At the beginning of 2002, we had a reserve of approximately $4 million for potential liability associated with a number of cases alleging the cessation of leases in the West Panhandle Field of the Texas Panhandle. During 2002, we reversed approximately $3 million of this accrued liability, and we reversed the remaining $0.8 million in 2003. As of December 31, 2003, there are no outstanding liabilities related to these cases. Oil and Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was $369.5 million, $221.2 million and $172.9 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The average DD&A rate per mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $1.38 (all domestic), $1.22 (all domestic) and $1.07 ($1.08 in U.S. and $0.90 in Canada) in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We expect the 2004 DD&A rate to be between $1.50 and $1.55 per mcfe produced. The increase in the average rate from 2001 to 2003 is primarily the result of higher drilling costs and higher costs associated with acquisitions. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets was $16.8 million in 2003, compared to $14.0 million in 2002 and $8.7 million in 2001. The increases in 2003 and 2002 were primarily the result of higher depreciation costs on fixed assets related to capital expenditures made in both years. Other property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis. Buildings are depreciated over 39 years, drilling rigs are depreciated over 15 years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to fifteen years. To the extent drilling rigs are used to drill our wells, a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in oil and gas properties as exploration or development costs. We expect 2004 depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between $0.07 and $0.09 per mcfe produced. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income was $2.8 million, $7.3 million and $2.9 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 2003 income consisted of $1.0 million of interest income, a $0.4 million loss on our equity investment in Pioneer Drilling Company, a $0.6 million gain on the final settlement of the sale of our Canadian subsidiary, and $1.6 million of miscellaneous income. The 2002 income consisted of $2.9 million in interest income, $2.9 million of interest accrued on our investment in Seven Seas, a $0.5 million gain on the sale of our RAM notes, a $0.3 million loss on our investment in Petroleum Place and $1.3 million of miscellaneous income. The 2001 income consisted of $0.9 million of interest income on our investment in Seven Seas notes and $0.5 million of interest income on our RAM notes. 39 Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $154.4 million in 2003, compared to $112.0 million in 2002 and $98.3 million in 2001. The increase in 2003 is due to a $517.7 million increase in average long term borrowings in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase in 2002 is due to a $264 million increase in average long term borrowings in 2002 compared to 2001. In addition to the interest expense reported, we capitalized $13.0 million of interest during 2003, compared to $5.0 million capitalized in 2002, and $4.7 million capitalized in 2001 on significant investments in unproved properties that were not being currently depreciated, depleted or amortized and on which exploration activities were in progress. Interest is capitalized using the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings. We expect 2004 interest expense to be between $0.45 and $0.50 per mcfe produced. From time to time, we enter into derivative instruments designed to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities) and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense. Included in interest expense in 2003 are a realized gain of $3.9 million related to interest rate derivatives and an unrealized loss on interest rate derivatives of $6.5 million. Included in interest expense in 2002 are a realized gain of $3.4 million related to interest rate derivatives and an unrealized loss on interest rate derivatives of $0.8 million. There were no such gains or losses in 2001. A detailed explanation of our interest rate hedging appears under the caption Hedging Activities Interest Rate Hedging elsewhere in this item 7. Loss on Investment in Seven Seas. In July 2001, Chesapeake purchased $22.5 million principal amount of 12% senior secured notes due 2004 issued by Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. and detachable seven year warrants to purchase approximately 12.6 million shares of Seven Seas common stock at an exercise price of approximately $1.78 per share. In the third quarter of 2002, Chesapeake recorded an impairment of $4.8 million representing 100% of the cost allocated to our Seven Seas common stock warrants. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded an additional impairment of $12.4 million to reduce our net investment in the senior secured notes, including accrued interest, to $7.5 million, representing Chesapeakes anticipated share of the net proceeds from the liquidation of Seven Seas assets in bankruptcy. In the third quarter of 2003, we received approximately $5.5 million in proceeds from the sale of its principal assets. Seven Seas reported in October 2003 that it had no source of additional cash flow and only contingent assets remaining, the value of which were highly speculative. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we determined that any remaining assets of Seven Seas would not be adequate for us to realize the remaining investment on our books. At that time, we recorded an impairment of $2.0 million which reduced the carrying value of our investment to zero. Loss on Repurchases of Debt. During 2003, we purchased and subsequently retired $106.4 million of our 8.5% senior notes due 2012 for a total consideration of $114.9 million, including accrued interest of $1.8 million and $6.7 million of redemption premium. In connection with this repurchase transaction we recorded a pre tax loss of $20.8 million, consisting of $6.7 million of redemption premium, $1.8 million write off of unamortized debt issue costs and notes discount, $0.3 million of transaction costs, and a write off of the call option value of $12.0 million carried as a discount on the 8.5% senior notes based on the hedging relationship between the notes and the swaption. During 2002, we purchased and subsequently retired $107.9 million of our 7.875% senior notes due 2004 for total consideration of $112.9 million, including accrued interest of $1.3 million and $3.7 million of redemption premium partially offset by a $1.7 million gain from interest rate hedging activities associated with the retired debt. During 2001, we purchased or redeemed $500.0 million principal amount of our 9.625% senior notes, $202.3 million principal amount of the 11.125% senior secured notes of Gothic Production Corporation, a Chesapeake subsidiary, and $120.0 million principal amount of our 9.125% senior notes. The purchase and redemption of these notes included payment of aggregate make whole and redemption premiums of $75.6 million and the write off of unamortized debt costs and debt issue premiums resulting in a pre tax loss of $76.7 million. 40 Impairments of Investments in Securities. During 2001 we recorded impairments to two equity investments of $10.1 million. The majority of this impairment was related to our investment in RAM Energy, Inc. In March 2001, we issued 1.1 million shares of Chesapeake common stock in exchange for 49.5% of RAMs outstanding common stock. Our shares were valued at $8.854 each, or $9.9 million in total. During 2001, we recorded our equity in RAMs net losses, which had the effect of reducing our carrying value in these securities to $8.6 million. In December 2001, we sold the RAM shares for minimal consideration. In addition, we reduced the carrying value of our $2.0 million investment in an Internet based oil and gas business by $1.5 million to $0.5 million. Gain on Sale of Canadian Subsidiary. In October 2001, we sold our Canadian subsidiary, which had oil and gas operations primarily in northeast British Columbia, for approximately $143.0 million. Under full cost accounting, our investment in these Canadian oil and gas properties was treated as a separate cost center for accounting purposes. As a result of the sale of this cost center, any gain or loss on the disposition was required to be recognized in current earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a gain on sale of our Canadian subsidiary of $27.0 million. Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. Chesapeake recorded income tax expense of $191.8 million in 2003, compared to income tax expense of $26.9 million in 2002 and income tax expense of $144.3 million in 2001. All income tax expense for 2003 and 2002 was related to our domestic operations. Income tax expense for 2001 was comprised of $127.6 million related to our domestic operations, $7.1 million related to our Canadian operations and $9.6 million related to the sale of our Canadian subsidiary. As of December 31, 2001, we determined that it was more likely than not that $2.4 million of the deferred tax assets related to Louisiana net operating losses will not be realized and we recorded a valuation allowance equal to such amounts. During 2003, we determined that it was more likely than not that an additional $4.4 million of the deferred tax assets related to Louisiana net operating losses will not be realized and we recorded an additional valuation allowance equal to such amounts. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change. Effective January 1, 2003, Chesapeake adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting For Asset Retirement Obligations. Upon adoption of SFAS 143, we recorded the discounted fair value of our expected future obligations of $30.5 million, a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as an increase to earnings of $2.4 million (net of income taxes) and an increase in net oil and gas properties of $34.3 million. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below. The companys management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the companys board of directors. The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. Hedging. From time to time, Chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates. Recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results of oil and gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales, and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales or interest expense. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be 41 recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in oil and gas sales. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in earnings. Differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument, if any, represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings. See Hedging Activities below and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. One of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives. We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These values are based upon, among other things, futures prices, volatility, time to maturity and credit risk. The values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis. This correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices, the primary risk we hedge, have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively. The factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates, the companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of $75.4 million, a liability of $44.7 million and an asset of $157.3 million, respectively. With respect to our derivatives held as of December 31, 2003, an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of $0.25 per mmbtu would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $86 million. An increase or decrease in crude oil prices of $1.00 per barrel would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $5 million. Oil and Gas Properties. The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Under the successful efforts method, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis. Additionally, gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the 42 successful efforts method. As a result, our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization rate. Capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 74% of our present value (discounted at 10%) of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves was evaluated by independent petroleum engineers, with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers. In addition, our internal engineers reevaluate our reserves on a quarterly basis. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is based on the amount of estimated reserves. If we maintain the same level of production year over year, the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly. Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. No income is recognized in connection with contractual services provided by Chesapeake on properties in which we hold an economic interest. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. We review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. The two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices, and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increases the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. In addition, the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period. Price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues. Such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the impact of revisions to reserve estimates can have a significant impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations. Our oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) rates have fluctuated between $0.75 per mcfe in 2000 to $1.38 per mcfe in 2003 reflecting the impact of changes in prices and finding costs during these periods. As of December 31, 2003, a decrease in natural gas prices of $0.10 per mcf and a decrease in oil prices of $1.00 per barrel would reduce the companys estimated proved reserves of 3,169 bcfe by 2.7 bcfe and 1.0 bcfe, respectively, and would also reduce the companys present value of estimated future net revenues by approximately $144.9 million and $25.0 million, respectively. 43 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Intangible Assets were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in June 2001 and became effective for us on July 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, respectively. SFAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method. Additionally, SFAS 141 requires companies to disaggregate and report separately from goodwill certain intangible assets. SFAS 142 establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized, but rather are reviewed annually for impairment. The Emerging Issues Task Forces (EITF) is considering two issues related to the reporting of oil and gas mineral rights. Issue No. 03 S, Application of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to Oil and Gas Companies, considers whether oil and gas drilling rights are subject to the classification and disclosure provisions of SFAS 142 if they are intangible assets. Chesapeake classifies the cost of oil and gas mineral rights as property and equipment and believes that this is consistent with oil and gas accounting and industry practice. If the EITF determines that oil and gas mineral rights are intangible assets and are subject to the applicable classification and disclosure provisions of SFAS 142, we estimate that $227.3 million and $72.5 million would be classified on our consolidated balance sheets as intangible undeveloped leasehold and $1.4 billion and $532.8 million would be classified as intangible developed leasehold as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts are net of accumulated DD&A. There would be no effect on the consolidated statements of operations or cash flows as the intangible assets related to oil and gas mineral rights would continue to be amortized under the full cost method of accounting. We will continue to classify our oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual rights representing the right to extract such reserves as tangible oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided. Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which Chesapeake operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as derivative instruments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. These differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent Chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations. Under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are: taxable income projections in future years, whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits, future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures, and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. 44 If (a) natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels (and if such decreases were considered other than temporary), (b) exploration, drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels, or (c) we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2003 we have a deferred tax asset of $194.9 million, of which only $6.8 million had an associated valuation allowance. Accounting for Business Combinations. Our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise. Prior to the issuance of SFAS 141, Accounting for Business Combinations in 2001, we applied the guidance provided by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 16, and its interpretations, as well as various other authoritative literature and interpretations that address issues encountered in accounting for business combinations. We have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method, which is the only method permitted under SFAS 141. The accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment. Under the purchase method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given, whether in the form of cash, assets, stock or the assumption of liabilities. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values, and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, if any, over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity, if any, is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain of the acquired assets. Determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment, since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable. Different techniques may be used to determine fair values, including market prices, where available, appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows, among others. Since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment, they can change as new information becomes available. Each of the business combinations completed during the past five years were of small to medium sized exploration and production companies with oil and gas interests primarily in the Mid Continent. We believe that the consideration we have paid to acquire these companies has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of acquisition. Consequently, we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations, nor do we expect to recognize any goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future. Disclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related Parties As of December 31, 2003, we had accrued accounts receivable from our chief executive officer and chief operating officer of $0.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively, representing billings for December 2003 which were paid in January 2004. Since Chesapeake was founded in 1989, our CEO and COO have acquired small working interests in certain of our oil and gas properties by participating in our drilling activities. Joint interest billing accounts of the CEO and COO are settled in cash. Under their employment agreements, the CEO and COO are permitted to participate in all, or none, of the wells drilled by or on behalf of Chesapeake during each calendar quarter, but they are not allowed to participate only in selected wells. A participation election is required to be received by the Compensation Committee of Chesapeakes board of directors 30 days prior to the start of a quarter. Their participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in their employment agreements, which, among other things, limit their individual participation to a maximum working interest of 2.5% in a well and prohibits participation in situations where Chesapeakes working interest would be reduced below 12.5% as a result of their participation. 45 In October 2001, we sold Chesapeake Canada Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary, for net proceeds of approximately $143.0 million. Our CEO and COO each received $2.0 million related to their fractional ownership interest in these Canadian assets, which they acquired and paid for pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements. The portion of the proceeds allocated to our CEO and COO was based upon the estimated fair values of the assets sold as determined by management and the independent members of our board of directors using a methodology similar to that used by Chesapeake for acquisitions of assets from disinterested third parties. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we paid legal fees of $2,123,000, $600,000, and $391,000, respectively, for legal services provided by a law firm of which a director is a member. Recently Issued Accounting Standards During 2002 and 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the following Statements of Financial Accounting Standards which were reviewed by Chesapeake to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting For Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We adopted this standard during the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and it did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation, or FIN 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantee of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. FIN 45s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The guarantors previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of FIN 45s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after December 15, 2002. Chesapeake is not a guarantor under any significant guarantees and thus this interpretation is not expected to have a significant effect on the companys financial position or results of operations. In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities An Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, and addresses consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs) by business enterprises. The primary objective of FIN 46 is to provide guidance on the identification and financial reporting of entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights; such entities are known as VIEs. FIN 46 requires an enterprise to consolidate a VIE if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both. An enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interest in making this determination. At December 31, 2003, Chesapeake did not have any entities that would qualify for consolidation in accordance with the provisions of FIN 46, as amended. Therefore, the adoption of FIN 46, as amended, did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We adopted this standard during the quarter ended September 30, 2003 and it did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. 46 In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. This statement establishes new standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of this statement as a liability because the financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer. This statement applies to certain forms of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments including certain types of preferred stock, written put options and forward contracts. Adoption of this standard did not have any significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 104, Revenue Recognition. SAB 104 revises or rescinds certain guidance included in previously issued staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations relating to revenue recognition. This bulletin was effective immediately upon issuance. Chesapeakes current revenue recognition policies comply with SAB 104. Forward Looking Statements This report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. They include statements regarding oil and gas reserve estimates, planned capital expenditures, the drilling of oil and gas wells and future acquisitions, expected oil and gas production, cash flow and anticipated liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations, expected future expenses and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. Statements concerning the fair values of derivative contracts and their estimated contribution to our future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. These market prices are subject to significant volatility. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under Risk Factors in Item 1 and include: the volatility of oil and gas prices, our substantial indebtedness, the strength and financial resources of our competitors, the cost and availability of drilling and production services, our commodity price risk management activities, including counterparty contract performance risk, uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves, projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures, our ability to replace reserves, the availability of capital, uncertainties in evaluating oil and gas reserves of acquired properties and associated potential liabilities, declines in the values of our oil and gas properties resulting in ceiling test write downs, drilling and operating risks, our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize our NOLs before expiration, future ownership changes which could result in additional limitations to our NOLs, 47 adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation, losses possible from pending or future litigation, and the loss of officers or key employees. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Oil and Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2003, our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, cap swaps, basis protection swaps and call options. These instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. For swap instruments, we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price, as defined in each instrument, to the counterparty. The fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. For cap swaps, Chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price. The fixed price received by Chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterpartys exposure. In other words, there is no limit to Chesapeakes exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty. Because this derivative includes a written put option (i.e., the cap), cap swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133) since the combination of the hedged item and the written put option do not provide as much potential for favorable cash flows as exposure to unfavorable cash flows. Basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point. Chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract. For call options, Chesapeake receives a cash premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option. If the floating price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, then Chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess. If the floating price settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from Chesapeake. Chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap. Under the counter swap, Chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter swap is 100% effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap. We refer to this locked in value as a locked swap. At the time Chesapeake enters into a counter swap, Chesapeake removes the original swaps designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under SFAS 133. The reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Instead, the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain (or loss) that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in oil and gas prices. Any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to oil and gas sales in the month of related production. 48 In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 39, Chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, to the extent that a legal right of set off exists. Gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales on the consolidated statements of operations. Pursuant to SFAS 133, certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity (i.e., temporary fluctuations in value) are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales. Unrealized gains (losses) included in oil and gas sales in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $10.5 million, $(87.3) million and $84.8 million, respectively. Following provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and gas sales. We recorded a gain (loss) on ineffectiveness of ($9.2) million, ($3.6) million and $2.5 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 49 As of December 31, 2003, we had the following open oil and gas derivative instruments designed to hedge a portion of our oil and gas production for periods after December 2003: Volume Weighted Average StrikePrice WeightedAveragePutStrikePrice Weighted Average Call StrikePrice Weighted Average Differential SFAS 133Hedge PremiumsReceived Fair Value at December 31, 2003 ($ in thousands) Natural Gas (mmbtu): Swaps: 2004 171,120,000 5.31 Yes $ $ (40,922 ) 2005 45,550,000 4.82 Yes (8,507 ) 2006 25,550,000 4.74 Yes 678 2007 25,550,000 4.76 Yes 3,432 Basis ProtectionSwaps: 2004 157,380,000 (0.17 ) No 18,390 2005 109,500,000 (0.16 ) No 11,042 2006 47,450,000 (0.16 ) No 4,123 2007 63,875,000 (0.17 ) No 5,280 2008 64,050,000 (0.17 ) No 4,613 2009 36,500,000 (0.16 ) No 2,757 Cap Swaps: 2004 29,320,000 5.31 3.75 No (8,475 ) 2005 36,500,000 5.31 3.79 No (9,015 ) 2006 7,300,000 5.36 3.75 No (1,118 ) Call Options: 2004 60,760,000 6.30 No 16,766 (17,876 ) Locked Swaps: 2004 No 2,302 Total Gas 16,766 (33,296 ) Oil (bbls): Cap Swaps: 2004 4,516,000 28.68 21.76 No (11,692 ) Total Oil (11,692 ) Total Gas and Oil $ 16,766 $ (44,988 ) We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates of fair value reported by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. The actual contribution to our future results of operations will be based on the market prices at the time of settlement and may be more or less than the fair value estimates used at December 31, 2003. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2003, we expect to transfer approximately $17.6 million of loss included in the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12 months when the transactions actually occur. All transactions hedged as of December 31, 2003 are expected to mature by December 31, 2007, with the exception of the basis protection swaps which extend through 2009. 50 Additional information concerning the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is as follows: December 31, 2003 2002 2001 ($ in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding, beginning of year $ (14,533 ) $ 157,309 $ (89,288 ) Change in fair value of contracts during the period (31,078 ) (52,419 ) 351,989 Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 17,389 (96,046 ) (105,392 ) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period (16,766 ) (45,603 ) Fair value of contracts when closed during the period 22,226 Fair value of contracts outstanding, end of year $ (44,988 ) $ (14,533 ) $ 157,309 The change in the fair value of our derivative instruments since January 1, 2003 resulted from an increase in market prices for natural gas and crude oil relative to the hedged price. Derivative instruments reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for oil and gas as of the consolidated balance sheet date. The derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs. Interest Rate Risk The table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. The fair value of the fixed rate long term debt has been estimated based on quoted market prices. Years of Maturity 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Fair Value ($ in millions) Liabilities: Long term debt, including current portion fixed rate $ 42.1 $ $ $ $ 209.8 $ 1,833.1 $ 2,085.0 (1) $ 2,279.5 Average interest rate 7.9 % 8.4 % 8.0 % 8.0 % 8.0 % (1) This amount does not include the discount included in long term debt of $27.0 million, the effect of interest rate swaps of $0.1 million and the effect of the swaption of ($ 0.5) million. Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility. All of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and therefore does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. However, changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt. Interest Rate Hedging We also utilize hedging strategies to manage the exposure our fixed rate senior notes have to interest rate changes. By entering into interest rate swaps, we convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. To the extent the interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the corresponding debt are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the derivative agreement. 51 The following describes interest rate swaps entered into during 2002 and 2003, all of which were terminated prior to contractual maturity, for cash settlements ($ in thousands): Date Initiated Fair Value at December 31, 2003 Date Closed Cash Settlement Received Gains Recognized in 2002 GainsRecognizedin 2003 Gains to beRecognizedin 2004 March 2002(a) $ July 2002 $ 7,500 $ 6,778 (c) $ 599 $ 123 June 2002 (b) July 2002 1,130 1,130 August 2003 (b) 870 January 2004 940 870 70 August 2003(b) 1,292 January 2004 1,370 1,292 78 (a) This instrument was designated as a fair value hedge with changes in the fair value recorded as an adjustment to the debt. Upon termination of the hedging relationship, the previously recorded changes in the fair value of the debt are amortized to earnings over the term of the debt. (b) These instruments were not designated as fair value hedges; therefore, changes in the fair value were recorded as adjustments to interest expense. (c) Of this amount, $1.7 million was recognized as a reduction to the loss on repurchases of debt upon retirement of 7.875% notes. In April 2002, Chesapeake entered into a swaption with an unrelated counterparty with respect to its 8.5% senior notes due 2012. The notional amount of the swaption was $142.7 million, which was the principal amount then outstanding under the 8.5% senior notes. The 8.5% senior notes included a call option whereby Chesapeake may redeem the debt at declining redemption prices beginning in March 2004. Under the swaption, the counterparty received the option to elect whether or not to enter into an interest rate swap with Chesapeake in March 2004, and Chesapeake received $7.8 million. The interest rate swap, if executed by the counterparty, requires Chesapeake to pay a fixed rate of 8.5% while the counterparty pays Chesapeake a floating rate of 6 month LIBOR plus 0.75%. Additionally, if the counterparty elects to enter into the interest rate swap, it may also elect to force Chesapeake to settle the transaction at the then current value of the interest rate swap. According to SFAS 133, a fair value hedge relationship exists between the embedded call option in the 8.5% senior notes and the swaption. The fair value of the swaption is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability, and the carrying amount of the debt is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the call option subsequent to the initiation of the swaption. Any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense. During the third quarter 2003, we exchanged and subsequently retired $32.0 million of our 8.5% senior notes. The exchange of debt was treated as a modification rather than an extinguishment. Accordingly, the adjustment to the carrying value of the debt of $3.3 million related to the application of hedge accounting was reflected as a discount on the notes issued in the exchange transaction and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. During the fourth quarter 2003, we purchased and subsequently retired $106.4 million of the remaining $110.7 million of 8.5% senior notes pursuant to a tender offer and recorded a $12.0 million loss related to the removal of the fair value designation of the corresponding amount of the swaption. Temporary fluctuations in the fair value of the portion of the swaption no longer designated as a fair value hedge are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. We recorded a $3.3 million unrealized loss in interest expense during 2003 due to a decline in the fair value of the portion of the swaption no longer designated as a fair value hedge. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining notional amount of the swaption designated as a fair value hedge was $4.3 million. We have recorded an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt of $0.5 million which represents the temporary fluctuations in the fair value of the call option included in the $4.3 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes. Since the inception of the swaption, we have recorded a change in the fair market 52 value of the swaption from a $7.8 million liability to a $32.6 million liability, an increase of $24.8 million. We have recorded as additional interest expense $5.6 million to reflect ineffectiveness after giving effect to the removal of the designation of a portion of the swaption as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133 as described previously. On February 27, 2004, Chesapeake and the counterparty agreed to extend the counterpartys right to require Chesapeake to settle the transaction on March 15, 2004 to April 15, 2004. On March 10, 2004, the counterparty exercised its option to enter into the interest rate swap effective March 15, 2004. On April 15, 2004 and each succeeding March 15, the counterparty may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current value of the interest rate swap. We may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current value of the interest rate swap at any time during the term of the swap. Cash payments related to the interest rate swap, if initiated, or as a result of cash settlement at termination, will be recorded as adjustments to interest expense. 53
