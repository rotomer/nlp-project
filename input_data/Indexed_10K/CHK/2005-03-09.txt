ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Data The following table sets forth certain information regarding the production volumes, oil and gas sales, average sales prices received and expenses for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net Production: Oil (mbbl) 6,764 4,665 3,466 Gas (mmcf) 322,009 240,366 160,682 Gas equivalent (mmcfe) 362,593 268,356 181,478 Oil and Gas Sales ($ in thousands): Oil sales $ 260,915 $ 132,630 $ 88,495 Oil derivatives realized gains (losses) (69,267 ) (12,058 ) (1,092 ) Oil derivatives unrealized gains (losses) 3,454 (9,440 ) (7,369 ) Total oil sales 195,102 111,132 80,034 Gas sales 1,789,275 1,171,050 470,913 Gas derivatives realized gains (losses) (85,634 ) (5,331 ) 97,138 Gas derivatives unrealized gains (losses) 37,433 19,971 (79,898 ) Total gas sales 1,741,074 1,185,690 488,153 Total oil and gas sales $ 1,936,176 $ 1,296,822 $ 568,187 Average Sales Price (excluding gains (losses) on derivatives): Oil ($ per bbl) $ 38.57 $ 28.43 $ 25.53 Gas ($ per mcf) $ 5.56 $ 4.87 $ 2.93 Gas equivalent ($ per mcfe) $ 5.65 $ 4.86 $ 3.08 Average Sales Price (excluding unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives): Oil ($ per bbl) $ 28.33 $ 25.85 $ 25.22 Gas ($ per mcf) $ 5.29 $ 4.85 $ 3.54 Gas equivalent ($ per mcfe) $ 5.23 $ 4.79 $ 3.61 Expenses ($ per mcfe): Production expenses $ 0.56 $ 0.51 $ 0.54 Production taxes (a) $ 0.29 $ 0.29 $ 0.17 General and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses (excluding stock based compensation) $ 0.09 $ 0.08 $ 0.10 Stock based compensation $ 0.01 $ 0.00 $ 0.00 Oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 1.61 $ 1.38 $ 1.22 Depreciation and amortization of other assets $ 0.08 $ 0.06 $ 0.08 Interest expense (b) $ 0.45 $ 0.55 $ 0.61 Interest Expense ($ in thousands): Interest expense $ 162,781 $ 151,676 $ 114,695 Interest rate derivatives realized (gains) losses (791 ) (3,859 ) (3,415 ) Interest rate derivatives unrealized (gains) losses 5,338 6,539 751 Total interest expense $ 167,328 $ 154,356 $ 112,031 Net Wells Drilled 546 456 279 Net Producing Wells as of the End of Period 8,058 5,873 4,237 29 Index to Financial Statements (a) Production taxes in 2004 include a benefit of $6.8 million, or $0.02 per mcfe, from 2003 severance tax credits. (b) Includes the effects of realized gains or (losses) from interest rate derivatives, but does not include the effects of unrealized gains or (losses) from interest rate derivatives. We manage our business as two separate segments, an exploration and production segment and a marketing segment. We refer you to note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 8 of this report, which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for 2004, 2003 and 2002 and our assets as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Executive Summary Chesapeake is the fourth largest independent producer of natural gas in the U.S. and owns interests in approximately 20,000 producing oil and gas wells. Our primary operating area is the Mid Continent region of the United States, which includes Oklahoma, western Arkansas, southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle, and we are building significant secondary operating areas in the South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast region, the Permian Basin of western Texas and eastern New Mexico and in the Ark La Tex area of central and eastern Texas and northern Louisiana. Our revenues, operating results, profitability and future growth depend on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable based on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil. We favor gas over oil, strive to establish regional dominance in our operating areas, have grown through a combination of drilling and acquisitions and manage price risk through opportunistic oil and natural gas hedging. We believe we have the largest onshore U.S. inventories of leasehold and 3 D seismic data (more than 3.3 million and 9.9 million net acres, respectively) with more than a seven year drilling backlog of 7,000 locations. Oil and natural gas production for 2004 was 362.6 bcfe, an increase of 94.2 bcfe, or 35%, over the 268.4 bcfe produced in 2003. We have increased our production for 15 consecutive years and 14 consecutive quarters. During these 14 quarters, Chesapeakes domestic production has increased 186%, for an average compound quarterly growth rate of 8% and an average compound annual growth rate of 35%. We believe this is one of the two best operating performances in the industry during this time period. In addition to increased oil and natural gas production, the prices we received were higher in 2004 than in 2003. On a natural gas equivalent basis, weighted average prices (excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $5.23 per mcfe in 2004 compared to $4.79 per mcfe in 2003. The increase in prices resulted in an increase in revenue of $157.6 million, and increased production resulted in an increase in revenue of $451.4 million, for a total increase in revenue of $609.0 million (excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). In each of the core operating areas where Chesapeake sells its oil and natural gas, established marketing and transportation infrastructures exist thereby contributing to high wellhead price realizations on all properties in which we own an economic interest. Chesapeake began 2004 with estimated proved reserves of 3,169 bcfe and ended the year with 4,902 bcfe. Taking into account production of 362.6 bcfe, reserve replacement during the year was 2,096 bcfe, or 578% of our production. This compares to reserve replacement of 459% and 334% for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Reserve additions through the drill bit were 962 bcfe (including 141 bcfe from performance revisions and 5 bcfe from revisions due to oil and natural gas price increases), or 46% of the total increase in 2004, and reserve additions through acquisitions, net of miscellaneous divestitures, were 1,134 bcfe, or 54% of the total increase. Our decline rate on producing properties is projected to be 26% in the first year (2005), 18% in year two, 14% in year three, 12% in year four and 11% in year five. During 2004, Chesapeake drilled 561 (425 net) operated wells and participated in another 890 (121 net) wells operated by other companies. Chesapeakes drilling costs were $756.0 million for operated wells and $235.9 million for non operated wells. The companys success rate was 96%. Our investment in leasehold and 30 Index to Financial Statements 3 D seismic data totaled $299.8 million (exclusive of leases acquired through acquisitions) and our acquisition expenditures totaled $2,112.4 million during 2004 (excluding $464 million of deferred taxes in connection with certain corporate acquisitions.) During 2004, we received net proceeds of $2.1 billion through issuances of $650 million of common equity, $313 million of preferred equity (4.125% convertible preferred stock), $300 million principal amount of 7.5% Senior Notes due 2014, $300 million principal amount of 7.0% Senior Notes due 2014 and $600 million principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2015. As of December 31, 2004, the companys debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total capitalization is the sum of debt and stockholders equity) was 49%, compared to 54% as of December 31, 2003. Additionally, through debt repurchases and exchanges completed in 2004, we have extended the average maturity of our long term debt to over nine years and have lowered our average interest rate to approximately 7.3%. During 2004, all of our outstanding 6.75% preferred stock was converted into 19,467,482 shares of common stock (at a conversion price of $7.70 per share). Also during 2004, we exchanged 4,496,890 shares of our outstanding 6.0% preferred stock for 23,979,817 shares of common stock. In March 2004, we paid $42.1 million representing the balance outstanding on our 7.875% Senior Notes upon their maturity and we redeemed the $4.3 million outstanding balance of our 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012. In December 2004, we repurchased and retired $190.8 million of our 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 for cash. We subsequently repurchased and retired an additional $11.0 million of our 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 for cash in January 2005. We intend to continue to focus on improving the strength of our balance sheet. We believe our business strategy and operational performance will lead to an investment grade credit rating for our unsecured debt in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sources of Liquidity and Uses of Funds Our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures (other than for certain acquisitions) is cash flow from operations. Based on our current production, price and expense assumptions, we expect cash flow from operations will exceed our drilling capital expenditures in 2005. Our budget for drilling, land and seismic activities during 2005 is currently between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. While we believe this level of exploration and development will be sufficient to increase our reserves in 2005 and achieve our target of a 10% to 20% increase in production over 2004 production (inclusive of acquisitions completed in 2005 through the filing date of this report but without regard to any additional acquisitions that may be completed in 2005), higher drilling and field operating costs, drilling results that alter planned development schedules, acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program, which is largely discretionary. Any cash flow from operations not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions, debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in 2005. Cash provided by operating activities (exclusive of changes in assets and liabilities) was $1,418.8 million in 2004, compared to $903.9 million in 2003 and $412.5 million in 2002. The $514.9 million increase from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and gas production. The $491.4 million increase from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to higher prices and higher volumes produced. We expect that 2005 production volumes will be higher than in 2004 and that cash provided by operating activities in 2005 will exceed 2004 levels. While a precipitous decline in gas prices in 2005 would significantly affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations, we have 34% of our expected oil production in 2005 hedged at an average NYMEX price of $41.02 per barrel of oil and 51% of our expected natural gas production in 2005 hedged at an average NYMEX price of $6.27 per mcf. This level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a substantial portion of our 2005 production. Depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and managements view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends, however, we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions. 31 Index to Financial Statements Based on fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices, our hedging counterparties may require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance from time to time. At December 31, 2004 and March 2, 2005, we had $66 million and $61 million, respectively, of letters of credit securing our performance of hedging contracts. To mitigate the liquidity impact of those collateral requirements, we have negotiated caps on the amount of collateral that we might be required to post with five of our counterparties. All of our existing commodity hedges that are not under our secured hedge facility are with these counterparties and the maximum amount of collateral that we would be required to post with these counterparties is capped at $230 million. A significant source of liquidity is our $1.25 billion revolving bank credit facility which matures in January 2010. At March 2, 2005, there was $749 million of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility. We use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed. We borrowed $2,160 million and repaid $2,101 million in 2004, and we borrowed and repaid $738 million in 2003 and $253 million in 2002 under our bank credit facility. We incurred $2.2 million, $2.5 million and $2.9 million of financing costs related to our revolving credit facility in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as a result of amendments to the credit facility agreement. We believe that our available cash, cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our revolving bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating, interest and general and administrative expenses, our capital expenditure budget, our short term contractual obligations and dividend payments at current levels for the foreseeable future. Our revolving bank credit facility and secured hedge facility are both syndicated facilities, neither of which contain material adverse or adequate assurance clauses. Although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings, neither the bank facility nor the secured hedge facility contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. The public and institutional markets have been our principal source of capital to finance certain of our acquisitions. We have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past, and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions. Nevertheless, we caution that ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties, as explained under Risk Factors in Item 1 Business. The following table reflects the proceeds from sales of securities we issued in 2004, 2003 and 2002 ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Total Proceeds Net Proceeds Total Proceeds Net Proceeds Total Proceeds Net Proceeds Unsecured senior notes guaranteed by subsidiaries $ 1,200.0 $ 1,166.0 $ 500.0 $ 485.4 $ 450.0 $ 439.4 Convertible preferred stock 313.3 304.9 402.5 390.4 Common stock 650.0 624.2 186.3 177.4 172.5 164.1 Total $ 2,163.3 $ 2,095.1 $ 1,088.8 $ 1,053.2 $ 622.5 $ 603.5 We filed a $600 million universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 28, 2004. Securities issued under this shelf may be in the form of common stock, preferred stock, depository shares representing fractional shares of preferred stock or debt securities of Chesapeake. A prospectus supplement will be prepared at the time of a debt or equity offering and will contain specific information about the security issued and the use of proceeds. No securities have been issued under this shelf registration statement. In June 2004, we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized capital stock. The number of authorized shares of our common stock increased from 350 million to 500 million and the number of authorized shares of our preferred stock increased from 10 million to 20 million. 32 Index to Financial Statements We paid dividends on our common stock of $38.9 million, $27.3 million and $5.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and we paid dividends on our preferred stock of $40.9 million, $20.9 million and $10.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We received $12.0 million, $9.3 million and $3.8 million from the exercise of employee and director stock options in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We paid $2.1 million to purchase treasury stock in 2003 to fund our matching contributions to our 401(k) make up plan. Outstanding payments from certain disbursement accounts in excess of funded cash balances where no legal right of set off exists increased by $88.3 million and $28.3 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. All disbursements are funded on the day they are presented to our bank using available cash on hand or draws on our credit facility. Historically, we have used significant funds to purchase and retire outstanding senior notes issued by Chesapeake. The following table shows our purchases and exchanges of senior notes for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively ($ in millions): Senior Notes Activity For the Year Ended December 31, 2004: Retired Premium Other(f) Issued Cash Paid 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 $ 190.8 $ 16.1 $ 0.5 $ 207.4 7.875% Senior Notes due 2004 42.1 42.1 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 4.3 0.2 4.5 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 (a) 482.8 62.1 (534.2 ) 10.7 $ 720.0 $ 16.3 $ 62.6 $ (534.2 ) $ 264.7 For the Year Ended December 31, 2003: 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 $ 106.4 $ 6.7 $ $ $ 113.1 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 (b) 32.0 1.5 (33.5 ) 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 (c) 27.9 1.6 (29.5 ) 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 and 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 (d) 22.9 0.8 (23.7 ) 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 and 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 (e) 61.2 2.6 (63.8 ) $ 250.4 $ 6.7 $ 6.5 $ (150.5 ) $ 113.1 For the Year Ended December 31, 2002: 7.875% Senior Notes due 2004 $ 107.9 $ 3.7 $ $ $ 111.6 (a) We issued $63.7 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes and $470.5 million of our 6.875% Senior Notes.

(f) Includes adjustments to accrued interest and discount associated with notes retired and new notes issued, cash in lieu of fractional notes, transaction costs and fair value hedging adjustments. 33 Index to Financial Statements Cash used in investing activities increased to $3,381.2 million in 2004, compared to $2,077.2 million in 2003 and $779.7 million in 2002. The following table shows our capital expenditures during these years ($ in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Exploration and development of oil and gas properties $ 1,276.3 $ 727.2 $ 400.2 Acquisitions of oil and gas companies, proved and unproved properties, net of cash acquired 1,914.7 1,261.3 331.7 Deposits for pending acquisitions 16.3 13.3 15.0 Cash paid for other investments 37.0 30.8 2.4 Additions to drilling rigs, plants, compressor and gathering systems 79.1 23.3 6.6 Additions to buildings and other fixed assets 70.7 49.4 30.6 Total $ 3,394.1 $ 2,105.3 $ 786.5 Through divestitures of oil and gas properties, we received $12.0 million in 2004, $22.2 million in 2003 and $0.8 million, in 2002. Sales of other assets and recoveries of investments in securities of other companies provided $0.9 million, $5.8 million and $5.8 million of cash in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2004, we took several steps to improve our capital structure, including the transactions described below under Financing Transactions. These transactions enabled us to extend our average maturity of long term debt to over nine years with an average interest rate of approximately 7.3%. The companys debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased to 49% and debt per mcfe of proved reserves decreased to $0.63 per mcfe. Maintaining a debt to total capitalization ratio below 50% and reducing debt per mcfe of proved reserves to below $0.60 are key goals of our business strategy. Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas ($347.1 million at December 31, 2004) and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate ($68.2 million at December 31, 2004). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. Our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements, such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities. We have not relied on off balance sheet financing arrangements in the past and we do not intend to rely on such arrangements in the future as a source of liquidity. We are not a commercial paper issuer. 34 Index to Financial Statements Investing Transactions The following table outlines significant investing transactions that we completed in 2004 and in January and February 2005 ($ in millions): Quarter Year Acquisition Location Amount First 2004 Concho Resources, Inc.

Fourth Quarter 2004 Completed a private placement of $600 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2015. Net proceeds of approximately $583.1 million were used to finance the Hallwood acquisition completed in December 2004, repurchase our 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 and repay amounts outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility. Paid $209.3 million (including premium of $16.1 million, accrued interest of $1.9 million and transaction costs of $0.5 million) for $190.8 million of 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 pursuant to a cash tender offer.

No cash was received or paid in connection with this transaction. Completed a mandatory conversion of $149.9 million of our 6.75% cumulative convertible preferred stock for 19.5 million of our common stock. No cash was received or paid in connection with this transaction. January and February 2005 Amended our revolving bank credit facility to increase the committed borrowing base to $1.25 billion and extend the maturity of the facility to January 2010. Completed a private purchase of $11.0 million of our 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 for $12.0 million (including premium of $0.8 million and accrued interest of $0.2 million). Contractual Obligations We currently have a $1.25 billion revolving bank credit facility which matures in January 2010. The credit facility was increased from $600 million to $1.25 billion in January 2005. As of December 31, 2004, we had $59.0 million of outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized $122.5 million of the facility for various letters of credit. Borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at either (i) the greater of the reference rate of Union Bank of California, N.A., or the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (ii) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), at our option, plus a 36 Index to Financial Statements margin that varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings. The collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically. The unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee that also varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings. Currently the annual commitment fee is 0.30%. Interest is payable quarterly or, if LIBOR applies, it may be payable at more frequent intervals. The credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, sell properties, purchase or redeem our capital stock, make investments or loans, and create liens. Prior to its amendment and restatement in January 2005, the credit facility agreement required us to maintain a current ratio (as defined) of at least 1 to 1 and a fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined) of at least 2.5 to 1. At December 31, 2004, our current ratio was 1.1 to 1 and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 5.6 to 1. As amended, the agreement no longer includes a current ratio test. The 2.5 to 1 fixed charge coverage ratio continues to apply and a new financial covenant was added requiring an indebtedness to EBITDA ratio (as defined) not to exceed 3.5 to 1. Under this test, our indebtedness to EBITDA ratio at December 31, 2004 was 2.1 to 1. If we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable. Such acceleration, if involving a principal amount of $10 million or more, would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures, which could in turn result in the acceleration of our senior note indebtedness. The credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of $50 million. Some of our commodity price and financial risk management arrangements require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations exceed certain levels. As of December 31, 2004, we were required to post $66 million of collateral in the form of letters of credit with respect to such derivative transactions. These collateral requirements were $61 million as of March 2, 2005. Future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties and fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates. We currently have arrangements with five of our counterparties which limit the amount of collateral that we would be required to post with a counterparty to no more than $50 million each. In May 2004, we entered into a secured natural gas hedging facility with a nationally recognized counterparty. Under this hedging facility, which matures in May 2009, we can enter into cash settled natural gas commodity transactions, valued by the counterparty, for up to $600 million. Outstanding transactions under the facility are collateralized by certain oil and gas properties, exclusive of the oil and gas properties that collateralize our revolving bank credit facility. The hedging facility is subject to an annual fee of 0.30% of the maximum total capacity and a 1.0% exposure fee, which is assessed quarterly on the average of the daily negative fair market value amounts, if any, during the quarter. As of December 31, 2004, the fair market value of the natural gas hedging transactions related to the hedging facility was an asset of $56.4 million. The hedging facility contains the standard representations and default provisions that are typical of such agreements. The agreement also contains various restrictive provisions which govern the aggregate gas production volumes that we are permitted to hedge under all of our agreements at any one time. The hedging facility is guaranteed by Chesapeake and its subsidiaries. Our subsidiary, Chesapeake Exploration Limited Partnership, is the borrower under our revolving bank credit facility and is the named party of our hedging facility. The facilities are guaranteed by Chesapeake and all its other subsidiaries. Our revolving bank credit facility and secured hedge facility are both syndicated facilities, neither of which contain material adverse or adequate assurance clauses. Although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings, neither the bank facility nor the secured hedge facility contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings. 37 Index to Financial Statements In addition to outstanding revolving bank credit facility borrowings discussed above, as of December 31, 2004, senior notes represented approximately $3.0 billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following ($ in thousands): 8.375% senior notes due 2008 $ 18,990 8.125% senior notes due 2011 245,407 9.0% senior notes due 2012 300,000 7.5% senior notes due 2013 363,823 7.0% senior notes due 2014 300,000 7.5% senior notes due 2014 300,000 7.75% senior notes due 2015 300,408 6.375% senior notes due 2015 600,000 6.875% senior notes due 2016 670,437 Discount on senior notes (84,924 ) Premium for interest rate swap 1,968 $ 3,016,109 In January 2005, we purchased $11.0 million of our 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008. No scheduled principal payments are required on any of the senior notes until 2008, when $8.0 million is due. Debt ratings for the senior notes are Ba3 by Moodys Investor Service (positive outlook), BB by Standard & Poors Ratings Services (positive outlook) and BB by Fitch Ratings. Our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of Chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness. All of our wholly owned subsidiaries guarantee the notes including Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., Mayfield Processing, L.L.C. and MidCon Compression, L.P., for which the guarantee became effective September 21, 2004. The indentures permit us to redeem the senior notes at any time at specified make whole or redemption prices. The indentures contain covenants limiting our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; make investments and other restricted payments; incur liens; engage in transactions with affiliates; sell assets; and consolidate, merge or transfer assets. The debt incurrence covenants do not presently restrict our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility. As of December 31, 2004, we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately $1.9 billion could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant. The table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 ($ in thousands): Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Long term debt obligations $ 3,158,065 $ $ $ 18,990 $ 3,139,075 Capital lease obligations 420 120 300 Operating lease obligations 7,017 2,415 2,650 853 1,099 Purchase obligations Standby letters of credit 122,788 122,788 Other long term obligations 1,468 1,468 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,289,758 $ 126,791 $ 2,950 $ 19,843 $ 3,140,174 38 Index to Financial Statements Hedging Activities Oil and Gas Hedging Activities Our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas. To mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes, we have entered into various derivative instruments. Executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the Board of Directors reviews the companys hedging program at every Board of Directors meeting. We believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging. As of December 31, 2004, our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps, cap swaps, basis protection swaps, call options and collars. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk contains a description of each of these instruments. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended. Hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and gas production. We closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss. Commodity markets are volatile, and Chesapeakes hedging activity is dynamic. Mark to market positions under oil and gas hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices. As described above under Contractual Obligations, we may be required to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts. Realized gains and losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas sales of $154.9 million or $0.43 per mcfe in 2004, a net decrease of $17.4 million or $0.06 per mcfe in 2003 and a net increase of $96.0 million or $0.53 per mcfe in 2002. Oil and gas sales also include changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, as well as gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of instruments designated as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains (losses) included in oil and gas sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $40.9 million, $10.5 million and ($87.3) million, respectively. Included in these unrealized gains (losses) are gains (losses) on ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges of ($8.2) million in 2004, ($9.2) million in 2003 and ($3.6) million in 2002. Changes in the fair value of oil and gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities, and locked in gains and losses of derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until being transferred to earnings in the month of related production. These unrealized losses, net of related tax effects, totaled $4.4 million, $20.3 million and $3.5 million as of December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2004, we expect to transfer to earnings approximately $7.3 million of the income included in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income during the next 12 months when the transactions actually occur. A detailed explanation of accounting for oil and gas derivatives under SFAS 133 appears under Application of Critical Accounting Policies Hedging elsewhere in this Item 7. 39 Index to Financial Statements The fair values of our oil and gas derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The estimated fair values of our oil and gas derivative instruments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 are provided below: December 31, 2004 2003 ($ in thousands) Derivative assets (liabilities): Fixed price gas swaps $ 57,073 $ (44,794 ) Fixed price gas locked swaps (77,299 ) 1,777 Fixed price gas cap swaps (48,761 ) (18,608 ) Fixed price gas counter swaps 4,654 Gas basis protection swaps 122,287 46,205 Gas call options(a) (5,793 ) (17,876 ) Fixed price gas collars (5,573 ) Fixed price oil cap swaps (8,238 ) (11,692 ) Estimated fair value $ 38,350 $ (44,988 ) (a) After adjusting for the remaining $3.2 million and $16.8 million premium paid to Chesapeake by the counterparty, the cumulative unrealized loss related to these call options as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was ($2.6) million and ($1.1) million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, we had hedged approximately 29% of our expected oil production and 42% of our expected natural gas production in 2005. In addition, hedging contracts were in place for approximately 9% of expected natural gas production in 2006. Natural gas basis protection swaps extend to 2009. A detailed listing of our oil and gas derivatives by year of maturity is included in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Additional information concerning changes in the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is as follows: December 31, 2004 2003 2002 ($ in thousands) Fair value of contracts outstanding, beginning of year $ (44,988 ) $ (14,533 ) $ 157,309 Change in fair value of contracts during the period (69,927 ) (31,078 ) (52,419 ) Contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period 154,901 17,389 (96,046 ) Fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period (5,369 ) (16,766 ) (45,603 ) Fair value of contracts when closed during the period 3,733 22,226 Fair value of contracts outstanding, end of year $ 38,350 $ (44,988 ) $ (14,533 ) Interest Rate Derivatives We also utilize hedging strategies to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. To the extent interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the corresponding debt are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the derivative agreement. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. 40 Index to Financial Statements As of December 31, 2004, the following interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to floating rate debt were outstanding: Term Notional Amount Fixed Rate Floating Rate Fair Value as of December 31, 2004 ($ in thousands) November 2004 June 2014 $ 75,000,000 7.500 % 6 month LIBOR in arrears plus 254 basis points $ (333 ) November 2004 January 2015 $ 75,000,000 7.750 % 6 month LIBOR in arrears plus 291 basis points $ (914 ) September 2004 August 2012 $ 75,000,000 9.000 % 6 month LIBOR plus 452 basis points $ (269 ) During 2004, we entered into and subsequently closed five separate interest rate swaps for a total gain of $3.8 million. These interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges of the related senior notes. The settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the related senior notes. The senior notes hedged mature in 2014 and 2015. In 2005, we closed the 7.5% and 7.75% interest rate swaps for gains totaling $0.8 million. These interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges of the related senior notes. The settlement amounts received will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the related senior notes. The senior notes hedged mature in 2014 and 2015. In March 2004, Chesapeake entered into an interest rate swap which requires Chesapeake to pay a fixed rate of 8.68% while the counterparty pays Chesapeake a floating rate of six month LIBOR plus 0.75% on a notional amount of $142.7 million. The counterparty may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current estimated fair value of the interest rate swap on March 15, 2005 and annually thereafter until March 15, 2011. The interest rate swap expires on March 15, 2012. Chesapeake may elect to terminate the swap and cause it to be settled at the then current estimated fair value of the interest rate swap at any time during the term of the swap. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of $34.3 million. Because the interest rate swap is not designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. In 2004, interest expense related to the swap included an unrealized loss of $4.2 million and a realized loss of $2.2 million. In January 2004, Chesapeake acquired a $50 million interest rate swap as part of the purchase of Concho Resources Inc. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, the counterparty pays Chesapeake a floating three month LIBOR rate and Chesapeake pays a fixed rate of 2.875%. Payments are made quarterly and the interest rate swap extends through September 2005. An initial liability of $0.6 million was recorded based on the fair value of the interest rate swap at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2004, the interest rate swap had a negligible fair value. Because this instrument is not designated as a fair value hedge, an unrealized gain of $0.1 million was recognized in 2004 as part of interest expense. Results of Operations General. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Chesapeake had net income of $515.2 million, or $1.53 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $2,709.3 million. This compares to net income of $313.0 million, or $1.21 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $1,717.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, and net income of $40.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $738.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. The 2004 net income includes, on a pre tax basis, a $24.6 million loss on repurchased debt, a $4.5 million provision for legal settlements and $35.5 million in net unrealized gains on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives. The 2003 net income includes, on a pre tax basis, a $20.8 million loss on repurchased debt, a $6.4 million provision for legal settlements, $4.0 million in net unrealized gains on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives and a $2.0 million impairment of our investment in Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. The 2002 net income includes, on a pre tax basis, $88.0 million in net unrealized losses on oil and gas and interest rate derivatives, a $17.2 million impairment of our investment in Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. and a $2.6 million loss on repurchased debt. 41 Index to Financial Statements Oil and Gas Sales. During 2004, oil and gas sales were $1,936.2 million compared to $1,296.8 million in 2003 and $568.2 million in 2002. In 2004, Chesapeake produced 362.6 bcfe at a weighted average price of $5.23 per mcfe, compared to 268.4 bcfe produced in 2003 at a weighted average price of $4.79 per mcfe, and 181.5 bcfe produced in 2002 at a weighted average price of $3.61 per mcfe (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or (losses) on derivatives of $40.9 million, $10.5 million and ($87.3) million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively). The increase in prices in 2004 resulted in an increase in revenue of $157.6 million and increased production resulted in a $451.4 million increase, for a total increase in revenues of $609.0 million (excluding unrealized gains or losses on oil and gas derivatives). The increase in production from period to period was due to the combination of production growth from drilling as well as acquisitions completed during those periods. For 2004, we realized an average price per barrel of oil of $28.33, compared to $25.85 in 2003 and $25.22 in 2002 (weighted average prices for all years discussed exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives). Natural gas prices realized per mcf (excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives) were $5.29, $4.85 and $3.54 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Realized gains or losses from our oil and gas derivatives resulted in a net decrease in oil and gas revenues of $154.9 million or $0.43 per mcfe in 2004, a net decrease of $17.4 million or $0.06 per mcfe in 2003 and a net increase of $96.0 million or $0.53 per mcfe in 2002. A change in oil and gas prices has a significant impact on our oil and gas revenues and cash flows. Assuming 2004 production levels, a change of $0.10 per mcf of gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $32.2 million and $30.4 million, respectively, and a change of $1.00 per barrel of oil sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately $6.8 million and $6.4 million, respectively, without considering the effect of hedging activities. The following table shows our production by region for 2004, 2003 and 2002: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mmcfe Percent Mid Continent 268,459 74 % 233,559 87 % 147,348 81 % South Texas and Texas Gulf Coast 42,427 12 15,546 6 16,349 9 Permian Basin 29,468 8 8,496 3 7,637 4 Ark La Tex 19,640 5 7,776 3 6,915 4 Other 2,599 1 2,979 1 3,229 2 Total Production 362,593 100 % 268,356 100 % 181,478 100 % Natural gas production represented approximately 89% of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in 2004, compared to 90% in 2003 and 89% in 2002. Oil and Gas Marketing Sales. Chesapeake realized $773.1 million in oil and gas marketing sales to third parties in 2004, with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of $755.3 million, for a net margin of $17.8 million. Marketing activities are substantially for third parties who are owners in Chesapeake operated wells. This compares to sales of $420.6 million and $170.3 million, expenses of $410.3 million and $165.7 million, and margins of $10.3 million and $4.6 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2004 and 2003, Chesapeake realized an increase in volumes and prices related to oil and gas marketing sales as compared to the previous year. Production Expenses. Production expenses, which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes, were $204.8 million in 2004, compared to $137.6 million and $98.2 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses were $0.56 per mcfe in 2004 compared to $0.51 and $0.54 per mcfe in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to higher field service costs. The decrease 42 Index to Financial Statements in costs on a per unit basis in 2003 is due primarily to lower production costs associated with properties acquired during the year and realization of efficiencies from a higher scale of operations in the Mid Continent region. We expect that production expenses per mcfe for 2005 will range from $0.62 to $0.67. Production Taxes. Production taxes were $103.9 million in 2004 compared to $77.9 million in 2003 and $30.1 million in 2002. On a unit of production basis, production taxes were $0.29 per mcfe in 2004 compared to $0.29 per mcfe in 2003 and $0.17 per mcfe in 2002. Included in 2004 is a credit of $6.8 million, or $0.02 per mcfe, related to certain Oklahoma severance tax abatements for the period July 2003 through December 2003. In April 2004, the Oklahoma Tax Commission concluded that a pre determined oil and gas price cap for 2003 sales had not been exceeded (on a statewide basis) and notified the company that it was eligible to receive certain severance tax abatements for the period from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004. The company had previously estimated that the average oil and gas sales prices in Oklahoma (on a statewide basis) could exceed the price cap, and did not reflect the benefit from these potential severance tax abatements until the first quarter of 2004. In general, production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and gas prices are higher. We expect production taxes per mcfe to range from $0.38 to $0.40 during 2005 based on an assumption that oil and natural gas wellhead prices will range from $6.00 to $6.50 per mcfe. General and Administrative Expense (Excluding Stock Based Compensation). General and administrative expenses, which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties (see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements), were $32.2 million in 2004, $22.8 million in 2003 and $17.3 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 and 2003 was the result of the companys growth related to the various acquisitions which occurred in 2004 and 2003 and the increase in drilling activity associated with the growth of our exploration activities. This growth has resulted in a substantial increase in employees and related costs. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses for 2005 will be between $0.10 and $0.11 per mcfe produced, which is approximately the same level as 2004. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. We capitalized $51.7 million, $35.5 million and $24.3 million of internal costs in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, directly related to our oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development efforts. Stock Based Compensation. Stock based compensation was $4.8 million in 2004, $0.9 million in 2003 and $0.4 million in 2002. During 2004, 2.7 million shares of restricted stock were granted to employees. The cost of all outstanding restricted shares is amortized over a four year period which resulted in the recognition of $6.3 million of stock based compensation costs during 2004. Of this amount, $4.2 million was reflected as stock based compensation expense (a sub category of general and administrative costs) in the consolidated statements of operations, and the remaining $2.1 million was capitalized to oil and gas properties. Chesapeake did not issue restricted stock awards prior to 2004. Additionally, we recognized $0.6 million, $0.9 million and $0.4 million in stock based compensation expense in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as a result of modifications made to previously issued stock options. Stock based compensation was $0.01 per mcfe for 2004. We anticipate that stock based compensation expense for 2005 will be between $0.04 and $0.06 per mcfe produced. Provision for Legal Settlements. In 2004, we recorded a provision for legal settlement of $4.5 million related to certain pending litigation. In 2003, recorded a $6.4 million provision related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit whereby we refunded certain royalty owners. Oil and Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was $582.1 million, $369.5 million and $221.2 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The average DD&A rate per mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $1.61, $1.38 and $1.22 in 2004, 2003 and 43 Index to Financial Statements 2002, respectively. The increase in the average rate from $1.38 in 2003 to $1.61 in 2004 is primarily the result of higher drilling costs, higher costs associated with acquisitions and the recognition of the tax effect of acquisition costs in excess of tax basis acquired in certain corporate acquisitions. We expect the 2005 DD&A rate to be between $1.75 and $1.80 per mcfe produced. Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization of other assets was $29.2 million in 2004, compared to $16.8 million in 2003 and $14.0 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 and 2003 was primarily the result of higher depreciation costs resulting from the acquisition of a processing plant, various gathering facilities, construction of new buildings at our corporate headquarters complex and at various field office locations and the purchase of additional information technology equipment and software in 2004 and 2003. Property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis. Buildings are depreciated over 39 years, drilling rigs are depreciated over 15 years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to fifteen years. To the extent drilling rigs are used to drill our wells, a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in oil and gas properties as exploration or development costs. We expect 2005 depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between $0.09 and $0.11 per mcfe produced. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income was $4.5 million, $2.8 million and $7.3 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2004 income consisted of $2.1 million of interest income, $0.8 million of income related to earnings on investments, and $1.6 million of miscellaneous income. The 2003 income consisted of $1.0 million of interest income, a $0.4 million loss on our investment in Pioneer Drilling Company (AMEX:PDC), a $0.6 million gain on the final settlement of the sale of our Canadian subsidiary and $1.6 million of miscellaneous income. The 2002 income consisted of $2.9 million in interest income, $2.9 million of interest accrued on our investment in Seven Seas, a $0.5 million gain on the sale of our investment in RAM notes, a $0.3 million loss on our investment in Petroleum Place and $1.3 million of miscellaneous income. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $167.3 million in 2004 compared to $154.4 million in 2003 and $112.0 million in 2002 as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 ($ in millions) Interest expense on senior notes and revolving bank credit facility $ 194.5 $ 163.2 $ 118.5 Capitalized interest (36.2 ) (13.0 ) (5.0 ) Amortization of loan discount 4.5 1.6 1.1 Unrealized loss on interest rate derivatives 5.3 6.5 0.8 Realized gain on interest rate derivatives (0.8 ) (3.9 ) (3.4 ) Total interest expense $ 167.3 $ 154.4 $ 112.0 Average long term borrowings $ 2,428 $ 1,932 $ 1,415 We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets (liabilities) and the debts carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative. Any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense. A detailed explanation of our interest rate derivative activity appears below in Item 7. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest expense, excluding unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, was $0.45 per mcfe in 2004 compared to $0.55 per mcfe in 2003 and $0.61 in 2002. We expect interest expense for 2005 to be between $0.43 and $0.47 per mcfe produced (before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives). 44 Index to Financial Statements Loss on Investment in Seven Seas. In July 2001, Chesapeake purchased $22.5 million principal amount of 12% senior secured notes due 2004 issued by Seven Seas Petroleum Inc. and detachable seven year warrants to purchase approximately 12.6 million shares of Seven Seas common stock at an exercise price of approximately $1.78 per share. In the third quarter of 2002, Chesapeake recorded an impairment of $4.8 million representing 100% of the cost allocated to our Seven Seas common stock warrants. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded an additional impairment of $12.4 million to reduce our net investment in the senior secured notes, including accrued interest, to $7.5 million, representing Chesapeakes anticipated share of the net proceeds from the liquidation of Seven Seas assets in bankruptcy. In the third quarter of 2003, we received approximately $5.5 million in proceeds from the sale of its principal assets. Seven Seas reported in October 2003 that it had no source of additional cash flow and only contingent assets remaining, the value of which was considered speculative. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2003 we determined that any remaining assets of Seven Seas would not be adequate for us to realize the remaining investment on our books. At that time, we recorded an impairment of $2.0 million which reduced the carrying value of our investment to zero. Loss on Repurchases or Exchanges of Debt. During the past three years we have repurchased or exchanged Chesapeake debt and incurred losses in connection with these transactions. The following table shows the losses related to these transactions for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively ($ in millions): NotesRetired Loss on Repurchases/Exchanges For the Year Ended December 31, 2004: Premium Other(a) Total 8.375% Senior Notes due 2008 $ 190.8 $ 16.1 $ 1.5 $ 17.6 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 4.3 0.2 0.7 0.9 8.125% Senior Notes due 2011 482.8 6.0 6.0 $ 677.9 $ 16.3 $ 8.2 $ 24.5 For the Year Ended December 31, 2003: 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 $ 106.4 $ 6.7 $ 14.1 (b) $ 20.8 For the Year Ended December 31, 2002: 7.875% Senior Notes due 2004 $ 107.9 $ 3.7 $ (1.1 )(c) $ 2.6 (a) Includes write offs of discounts, deferred charges and interest rate derivatives associated with notes retired and transaction costs. (b) Includes a $12.0 million loss that was recognized based on the hedging relationship between the notes and the interest rate derivative. (c) Includes a $1.7 million gain that was recognized based on the hedging relationship between the notes and the interest rate derivative. Income Tax Expense. Chesapeake recorded income tax expense of $289.8 million in 2004 compared to income tax expense of $191.8 million in 2003 and $26.9 million in 2002. Our effective income tax rate decreased to 36% in 2004 compared to 38% in 2003 and 40% in 2002. The decrease in 2004 and 2003 reflected the impact state income taxes and permanent differences had on our overall effective rate. Our effective income tax rate will increase to 36.5% in 2005 to reflect our current assessment of the impact state income taxes and permanent differences will have on our overall effective rate. During 2003 and 2001, we determined that it was more likely than not that $4.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, of the deferred tax assets related to Louisiana net operating losses would not be realized and we recorded a valuation allowance equal to such amounts during those years. In 2004, we acquired Louisiana oil and gas properties which resulted in us determining that it was more likely than not that the $6.8 million of deferred tax assets related to Louisiana net operating losses would be realized. Therefore, the $6.8 million valuation allowance was reversed at December 31, 2004 as part of the recording of the purchase of these assets. All 2004 income tax expense was deferred, and we expect most, if not all, of our 2005 and 2006 income tax expense to be deferred. 45 Index to Financial Statements Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change. Effective January 1, 2003, Chesapeake adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting For Asset Retirement Obligations. Upon adoption of SFAS 143 in 2003, we recorded the discounted fair value of our expected future obligations of $30.5 million, a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle, as an increase to earnings of $2.4 million (net of income taxes) and an increase in net oil and gas properties of $34.3 million. Loss on Conversion/Exchange of Preferred Stock. Loss on conversion/exchange of preferred stock was $36.7 million in 2004. This loss was the result of a private exchange of $30.0 million of our 6.0% cumulative convertible preferred stock for 3.2 million shares of common stock and a public exchange of $194.8 million of our 6.0% cumulative convertible preferred stock for 20.8 million shares of common stock. The loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms. We also incurred $1.2 million in transaction costs related to the public exchange. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place. The four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below. The companys management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the companys board of directors. The selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed. Accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives, but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business. Hedging. Chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates. Recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results of oil and gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales, and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains (losses) within oil and gas sales or interest expense. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged, or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation, which is established at the inception of a derivative. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is effective, are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by SFAS 133, is recognized immediately in oil and gas sales. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges (in accordance with SFAS 133), changes in fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in earnings. Differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument, if any, represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings. See Hedging Activities above and Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities. 46 Index to Financial Statements One of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives. We have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources. These values are based upon, among other things, futures prices, volatility, time to maturity and credit risk. The values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions or other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis. This correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices, the primary risk we hedge, have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively. The factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors, many of which are beyond our control. Due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates, the companys financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of $2.5 million, a liability of $75.4 million and a liability of $44.7 million, respectively. With respect to our derivatives held as of December 31, 2004, an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of $0.10 per mmbtu would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $21 million. An increase or decrease in crude oil prices of $1.00 per barrel would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately $2 million. Oil and Gas Properties. The accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. There are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities: the successful efforts method and the full cost method. Chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are capitalized. We also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition, exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Under the successful efforts method, geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense. Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis. Additionally, gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method. As a result, our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization rate. Capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense is also based on the amount of estimated reserves. If we maintain the same level of production year over year, the depreciation, depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly. Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. No income is recognized in connection with contractual services provided by Chesapeake on properties in which we hold an economic interest. The costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated. We review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred. Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant. 47 Index to Financial Statements We review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. This quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test. Under the ceiling test, capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues (adjusted for cash flow hedges) less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. The two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices, and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. Revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increases the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 76% of our present value (discounted at 10%) of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves was evaluated by independent petroleum engineers, with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers. In addition, our internal engineers reevaluate our reserves on a quarterly basis. All reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data we developed. The present value of estimated future net revenue shown is not intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves we own. Additional information about our 2004 year end reserve evaluation is included under Oil and Gas Reserves in Item 1 Properties. In addition, the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period. Price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues. Such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the impact of revisions to reserve estimates can have a significant impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations. Our oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization rates have fluctuated between $1.22 per mcfe in 2002 to $1.61 per mcfe in 2004 reflecting the impact of changes in prices and finding costs during these periods. As of December 31, 2004, a decrease in natural gas prices of $0.10 per mcf and a decrease in oil prices of $1.00 per barrel would reduce the companys estimated proved reserves by 3.4 bcfe and by 0.7 bcfe, respectively, and would also reduce the companys present value of estimated future net revenues by approximately $215 million and $40 million, respectively. Income Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which Chesapeake operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as derivative instruments, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes. These differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess, using all available positive and negative evidence, the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income. If we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Generally, to the extent Chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period, we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations. 48 Index to Financial Statements Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists (a) the more positive evidence is necessary and (b) the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset. Among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are: taxable income projections in future years, whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits, future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures, and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition. If (a) natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels (and if such decreases were considered other than temporary), (b) exploration, drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels, or (c) we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration, we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2004, we had deferred tax assets of $240.8 million. Accounting for Business Combinations. Our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise. We have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method, which is the only method permitted under SFAS 141. Prior to the issuance of SFAS 141, Accounting for Business Combinations in 2001, we applied the guidance provided by Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 16, and its interpretations, as well as various other authoritative literature and interpretations that address issues encountered in accounting for business combinations. The accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment. Under the purchase method of accounting, a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given, whether in the form of cash, assets, stock or the assumption of liabilities. The assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values, and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values. The excess of the cost of an acquired entity, if any, over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity, if any, is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets. Determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment, since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable. Different techniques may be used to determine fair values, including market prices, where available, appraisals, comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows, among others. Since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment, they can change as new information becomes available. Each of the business combinations completed during the past five years were of small to medium sized exploration and production companies with oil and gas interests. We believe that the consideration we have paid to acquire these companies has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of acquisition. Consequently, we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations, nor do we expect to recognize any goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future. Disclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related Parties As of December 31, 2004, we had accrued accounts receivable from our CEO and COO of $4.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, representing joint interest billings from December 2004 which were invoiced and paid 49 Index to Financial Statements in January 2005. Since Chesapeake was founded in 1989, our chief executive officer and chief operating officer have acquired small working interests in certain of our oil and gas properties by participating in our drilling activities. Joint interest billings to the CEO and COO are settled in cash immediately upon delivery of a monthly joint interest billing. Under their employment agreements, the CEO and COO are permitted to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of Chesapeake during each calendar quarter, but they are not allowed to participate only in selected wells. A participation election is required to be received by the Compensation Committee of Chesapeakes Board of Directors 30 days prior to the start of a quarter. Their participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in their employment agreements, which, among other things, limit their individual participation to a maximum working interest of 2.5% in a well and prohibits participation in situations where Chesapeakes working interest would be reduced below 12.5% as a result of their participation. In addition, the company is reimbursed for the cost of its leasehold acquired by the CEO and COO as a result of their well participation. As disclosed in
